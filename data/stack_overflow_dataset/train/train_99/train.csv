There's nothing there, because I didn't add anything to it, but it's more like what you'd expect. A blank window.

What happens when a client wants a website designed and developed, and they don't have any design ideas, images or logo etc, let alone a PSD template? 

Is it standard practice at this point to find a good web designer and get them involved. Would I be paying the web designer out of the money that I am getting for developing the site?

I imagine that the web designer would need to be involved in design related discussions with the client, is it therefore standard practice to involve them in the process?

One last thing, is it often the case that I ""hide"" the designer from the client, so if the client gives me a logo and images etc, I find a designer to throw up a mock, show it to the client, he requests changes, my designer makes the changes, I show the client etc etc. All the time, the client assumes/doesn't ask if I am the designer?

Hopefully someone gets the gist of what I am asking here,

We learn new paradigms from languages. We learn new techniques. We pick up new design patterns. But how about <i>general coding style and practice</i>? What specific-language idioms have you soaked up and then applied almost across the board? I'd love to hear them.

This is a nice opportunity to pick out nice traits of all the languages we've used rather than putting them up against each other. Some languages have communities that enforce conventions that often map very nicely onto other languages too.

Post languages with the respective conventions/idioms of that language that have altered the way you code in <i>all</i> languages where the language allows. Obviously this stuff is all subjective, but also all positive :)

Let me start off my own personal list just for an example:
<ul>
  <li>Java: Long and tedious names are better than acronyms or abbreviations, unless very common.
  <li>Perl: Premature returns and gotos are better than arrow-head code. When I say goto, I mean the language's variant: like break labels in Java, next/redo/last in Perl, and break/continue in C. There's simply too much state and scoped variables being juggled around in arrow-head code to be manageable.
  <li>Haskell: When lambdas are doing a specific thing (like <i>not</i> just to get I/O values into a named value), they should probably be explicitly named, not declared inline.
  <li>Lisp: Keep it simple. A few closures thrown into a namespace will be a far easier way of managing state than maintaining a 4-layer inheritance hierarchy tree. Assuming the language is up to it, obviously.
  <li>C++: It's OK to ignore a subset of a language if you really don't think it's needed for a solution.
  <li>Perl: Important information should be as high-up and left as possible. Kinda why I didn't stick with Factor for long -- Poor end-weighting.
  <li>C#: Be pragmatic. If calling native code <i>really</i> makes sense, do it. If using pointer-trickery in unsafe blocks makes absolute sense, do it. Just make sure your decisions are justified. Don't be an anal theorist, unless you get paid for it :)
  <li>C++: Don't bother using immutability as a guarantee unless your language has transient-immutability. I.e. almost none of them.
  <li>Lisp and Haskell: Don't be afraid to declare tiny functions or methods. You're defining a name for a common operation, so it doesn't matter that it doesn't do that much.
  <li>Assembly: Code maintainability is more about general discipline than any fad programming-theory or whatever else.
  <li>Haskell: Code interfaces kick the crap inheritance or blind appliance of fad-design patterns, bar rare scenarios where inheritance actually fits <i>better</i>. I need say no more. I mean 'interfaces' in a very general sense, whether it be Haskell typeclasses, C#'s interfaces, or Perl's fire-and-forget-and-pray-to-moon-Gods-that-it-works-oh-wait-it-doesn't-lets-hack-the-symbol-table-using-56-line-regex-that'll-do-it method.
  <li>Visual Basic: Contrary to what many UNIX people think, a shit-hot IDE <i>does</i> make a lot of difference.
  <li>C and Perl: Contrary to what many Windows people think, using a shit-hot editor like Vim <i>does</i> make a lot of difference.
  <li>Haskell: Lazy evaluation is approximately 400% more sane than eager in most high-level scenarios you want a simple plural of items. Fake it in other languages where you can via iterators.
  <li>Perl: Separators shouldn't be omitted in multiline statements, like commas after array elements for example.
  <li>Perl: Don't discuss to many topics at once. Contextualize the main thing you're trying to do and try to keep it all oriented around that one thing until you recontextualize.
  <li>C++: Indeterminate deconstruction is evil. Don't rely on a language's GC finalization method unless it has some decent guarantees. Most don't.
  <li>Perl: Ambiguity is fine, as long as you localize it as much as possible.
  <li>Java with AWT/Swing: If you're going to try writing a cross-platform GUI, don't use a heavy-weight toolkit -- Even if non-native functionality is implemented via lightweight components, you're still going to hit more problems than if you used a full lightweight toolkit or a 100% native toolkit from the get-go.
  <li>Lisp: View any new fad design pattern with deep suspicion. The law of the universe dictate it's a half-arsed half-realized hyped-up design that good abstractors were doing anyway.
  <li>Java: A platform is often more important than picking the actual language. Availability and standard libraries mean something, y'know.
  <li>BBC Micro BASIC: Sometimes having tools removed from your toolbox lets you see more obvious solutions.
</ul>

We learn new paradigms from languages. We learn new techniques. We pick up new design patterns. But how about <i>general coding style and practice</i>? What specific-language idioms have you soaked up and then applied almost across the board? I'd love to hear them.

This is a nice opportunity to pick out nice traits of all the languages we've used rather than putting them up against each other. Some languages have communities that enforce conventions that often map very nicely onto other languages too.

Post languages with the respective conventions/idioms of that language that have altered the way you code in <i>all</i> languages where the language allows. Obviously this stuff is all subjective, but also all positive :)

Let me start off my own personal list just for an example:
<ul>
  <li>Java: Long and tedious names are better than acronyms or abbreviations, unless very common.
  <li>Perl: Premature returns and gotos are better than arrow-head code. When I say goto, I mean the language's variant: like break labels in Java, next/redo/last in Perl, and break/continue in C. There's simply too much state and scoped variables being juggled around in arrow-head code to be manageable.
  <li>Haskell: When lambdas are doing a specific thing (like <i>not</i> just to get I/O values into a named value), they should probably be explicitly named, not declared inline.
  <li>Lisp: Keep it simple. A few closures thrown into a namespace will be a far easier way of managing state than maintaining a 4-layer inheritance hierarchy tree. Assuming the language is up to it, obviously.
  <li>C++: It's OK to ignore a subset of a language if you really don't think it's needed for a solution.
  <li>Perl: Important information should be as high-up and left as possible. Kinda why I didn't stick with Factor for long -- Poor end-weighting.
  <li>C#: Be pragmatic. If calling native code <i>really</i> makes sense, do it. If using pointer-trickery in unsafe blocks makes absolute sense, do it. Just make sure your decisions are justified. Don't be an anal theorist, unless you get paid for it :)
  <li>C++: Don't bother using immutability as a guarantee unless your language has transient-immutability. I.e. almost none of them.
  <li>Lisp and Haskell: Don't be afraid to declare tiny functions or methods. You're defining a name for a common operation, so it doesn't matter that it doesn't do that much.
  <li>Assembly: Code maintainability is more about general discipline than any fad programming-theory or whatever else.
  <li>Haskell: Code interfaces kick the crap inheritance or blind appliance of fad-design patterns, bar rare scenarios where inheritance actually fits <i>better</i>. I need say no more. I mean 'interfaces' in a very general sense, whether it be Haskell typeclasses, C#'s interfaces, or Perl's fire-and-forget-and-pray-to-moon-Gods-that-it-works-oh-wait-it-doesn't-lets-hack-the-symbol-table-using-56-line-regex-that'll-do-it method.
  <li>Visual Basic: Contrary to what many UNIX people think, a shit-hot IDE <i>does</i> make a lot of difference.
  <li>C and Perl: Contrary to what many Windows people think, using a shit-hot editor like Vim <i>does</i> make a lot of difference.
  <li>Haskell: Lazy evaluation is approximately 400% more sane than eager in most high-level scenarios you want a simple plural of items. Fake it in other languages where you can via iterators.
  <li>Perl: Separators shouldn't be omitted in multiline statements, like commas after array elements for example.
  <li>Perl: Don't discuss to many topics at once. Contextualize the main thing you're trying to do and try to keep it all oriented around that one thing until you recontextualize.
  <li>C++: Indeterminate deconstruction is evil. Don't rely on a language's GC finalization method unless it has some decent guarantees. Most don't.
  <li>Perl: Ambiguity is fine, as long as you localize it as much as possible.
  <li>Java with AWT/Swing: If you're going to try writing a cross-platform GUI, don't use a heavy-weight toolkit -- Even if non-native functionality is implemented via lightweight components, you're still going to hit more problems than if you used a full lightweight toolkit or a 100% native toolkit from the get-go.
  <li>Lisp: View any new fad design pattern with deep suspicion. The law of the universe dictate it's a half-arsed half-realized hyped-up design that good abstractors were doing anyway.
  <li>Java: A platform is often more important than picking the actual language. Availability and standard libraries mean something, y'know.
  <li>BBC Micro BASIC: Sometimes having tools removed from your toolbox lets you see more obvious solutions.
</ul>

Through a series of random events they will soon be without a front end developer and a graphic designer.  Rather than hire these positions back on, there is talk of outsourcing the work to a group in a nearby state that manages developers all over southern asia.  So far there has not been any discussion of exporting core code development (.. because then they wouldn't even be a development group!). 

I am inherently nervous about this idea, but willing to concede that might just be due to personal sensibilities.  I have never worked in an organization that sent work out of the country and have the typical reservations mostly centered around quality and project communication.  I'm particularly concerned about having two consecutive steps in the development chain outsourced.  Has anyone had positive experience with quality & communication in a web project outsourced to the point of code development?  Negative?  Recommendations?

I understand that this approach looks very attractive in many ways.

A small web development group (less than 15 people) I do some work for is looking at outsourcing some work.  Through a series of random events they will soon be without a front end developer and a graphic designer.  Rather than hire these positions back on, there is talk of outsourcing the work to a group in a nearby state that manages developers all over southern asia.  So far there has not been any discussion of exporting core code development (.. because then they wouldn't even be a development group!). 

I am inherently nervous about this idea, but willing to concede that might just be due to personal sensibilities.  I have never worked in an organization that sent work out of the country and have the typical reservations mostly centered around quality and project communication.  I'm particularly concerned about having two consecutive steps in the development chain outsourced.  Has anyone had positive experience with quality & communication in a web project outsourced to the point of code development?  Negative?  Recommendations?

I understand that this approach looks very attractive in many ways.

 - *Reliability*: What would I do if this machine goes down? :-( - May be I'll need a multiple machine setup, but twitter stream cannot be split up in real time via different connections?
 - *Scalability*: Twitter TPS can shoot up in near future? Need to plan for thicker pipes in the near future?
 - **Faster harddisks**: WD/Seagate server class 7200RPM with 64MB cache can do up to 128MB/s 
 *Reliability*: What happens if this hard drive fails? a bunch of disks should do? But what config? RAID? 
 - *Scalability*:For temporary storage this should work well, but if I need to archive 200 million tweets, I am probably going to need a more scalable solution. Hadoop HDFS is a good idea?
 - **Security**: A corporate would want this machine to sit outside a DMZ? So, storing data temporarily (say 5minutes) of it on this server class machine and then pulling it into a HDFS would be a good idea?

I will make up a real world case to put things clear. Suppose I have to model a cube in 3d space, and this cube has a specific material: an object of type Cube contains a set of information about its spatial position, and also the type of material, as a string. This cube is passed around to many algorithms and classes, so that they can perform their tasks, such as rendering the cube. 

For this to happen, these algorithms and classes require additional info about the object, namely, the material properties such as reflectiveness. These info are not specific to that object, but can be obtained by means of the current object data (namely, the material the cube is made of).

Technically, I have a database of materials, so I can always resolve the string declaration of the material for the specific cube into detailed info about that specific material. The renderer need these info, so I am in the following possible situations:

 1. I pass the cube _and_ the database to the renderer, and let the renderer query the database, get the info about the material, and render the cube
 2. I make the database a global object, which can be queried regardless of the position in the code, saving the need to pass the database around, but creating an implicit dependency against the database
 3. I get data about the material, and stick it to the Cube object somehow, removing the need to pass around or even keep the database active any longer. Once I got the data, I'm off. This means that the Cube is added information at a later stage, being in a sort of invalid condition until these data are actually moved from the database into the cube.
 4. I consider the cube object self contained with its information, I also define another object with the data about the materials, and then create a new object containing a merge of these two information, something like a MaterialDescribedCube

 2. I make the database a global object, which can be queried regardless of the position in the code, saving the need to pass the database around, but creating an implicit dependency against the database
 3. I get data about the material, and stick it to the Cube object somehow, removing the need to pass around or even keep the database active any longer. Once I got the data, I'm off. This means that the Cube is added information at a later stage, being in a sort of invalid condition until these data are actually moved from the database into the cube.
 4. I consider the cube object self contained with its information, I also define another object with the data about the materials, and then create a new object containing a merge of these two information, something like a MaterialDescribedCube
  
Is there a known-good pattern for this kind of situation ?

For example, I wanted to use the ""Change Speed"" effect available in _Audacity_ in order to stretch or compress audio data without changing pitch in a different project.  In this case, it wasn't too hard to hunt through the code and find that the functionality was provided by a largely independent library.  So it was easy to extract and use for my purposes.  

I've had less success hunting down other functionality or when I found it, it was so tightly coupled with other code that it was easier to recreate the functionality or look elsewhere.  So I guess I'm looking for strategies for meeting with success.  

The problem that spurred this specific question was that I was thinking it would be interesting to understand how the ""Text Along Path"" functionality works in projects like _GIMP_ and _Inkscape_ with the idea that one might extrapolate the functionality to follow a 3D path for rendering with OpenGL (projects like _FTGL_ and _OGLFT_ will render text onto a plane and then extrude it for a 3D effect, but I don't know of a library that lets you put the text onto a custom curve).  I'd also be interested in exploring what it might take to patch GIMP's text handling to be more like Inkscape's, etc.  I realize that many Open Source projects have a great, supportive, developer community; so that's one strategy.

 - [Clean code][1] by Robert C. Martin
 - [Agile Principles, Patterns, and Practices in C#][2] by Robert C. Martin and Micah Martin
 - [What is software design?][3] by Jack W. Reeves
 - My current project (where we should comment everything in the code)

Mr. Reeves states in his paper that the code is the design and the compiler is doing the atual build, that is, we, the developers, do the actual design when we coding. So do we need to write the design document before we start coding? Should we comment everything we write in code? I think not. Take the following simple example:

    //<summary>
    // True if object is deleted
    //</summary>
    public bool IsDeleted() {...}

Isn't the comment just noise? What do it add to the code that the function name doesn't already says? And how do we keep that documentation, and design documentation, up to date? When doing are test, debug and fix we will most likely change the code and design... but will we change the design document? Many of us will most likely forget to update the design document because it is not the real design document, the code is.

So how do we create good documentation? Write good code that conforms to the [SOLID][4] principles (if object oriented programming), and also write your code so you can read it, that is use proper names.

So what do you say? How much documentation do we need? When should we write it? How do we maintain it?
