In both of them I have been asked what is LINQ as the last question.

Well I said that Linq is an unnamed method in place of a delegate. And that it would provide lazy loading through its nature of IQueryabe and IEnumerable.

But somehow that wasn't enough.

I find it very hard to explain this precisely on a telephone interview.  

Does anyone know better?

As I understand it, having read [this extremely informative article][1], these private classes are value types, and they aren't tagged with the `CompilerGeneratedAttribute` class.

I'm working on a project that needs to process certain types and ignore others.

I have to be able to process custom struct types, which, like the generated static array initializer classes, are value types. I must ignore the generated static array initializer classes. I also must ignore enumerations and delegates.

I'm pulling these classes with Linq, like so:

    var typesToProcess = allTypes.Where(type => !type.IsEnum &&

I'm fairly sure that the `IsArray` property isn't what I think it is. At any rate, the generated static array initializer class still shows up in the `typesToProcess` Enumerable.

Has anyone else dealt with this? How can I discern the difference between a custom struct and a generated static array initializer class? I could hack it by doing a string comparison of the type name against `__StaticArrayInitTypeSize`, but is there a cleaner solution?
