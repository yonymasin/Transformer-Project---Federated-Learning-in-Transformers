For example, why is there a `/usr/local/bin/` and a `/usr/bin/` (one local and one not?) and why does some software get installed in one and not the other?

And what about files like `.bashrc`, `.profile` and `.bash_profile` - I understand that `.bashrc` is executed when a shell starts up and it checks the paths inside that file for application settings and stuff like that, but why do I not have either `.profile` and `.bash_profile` on my work computer, but on my home laptop I have `.bash_profile` and in some places I've seen articles where people ask the user to set-up a `.profile` if it doesn't exist?

Again, this is a bit of a strange question because there isn't a specific *thing* I want to know, just the common stuff that crops us when you need to install software via the Terminal and you're asked to do things like setting paths and variables and choosing locations of where to install stuff (which bin folder to use) and stuff like that, so a general overview of all this would be amazing!

Any help I can get understanding how the above items work and why would be great!

Thanks.",3

I'm new to both bash and sed (and MSYS), so I'm not sure whether this is an issue of passing variables to sed or using quotes the wrong way. I tried replacing my function with [the one provided here][1], but still got the same error. 

In case this is an issue of misplacing quotes, then what's the difference between how sed and grep handle user input in bash? (As opposed to sed, using `'""$*""'` in a grep function does work.)

Thanks for any help and explanations!

3. Removes (i.e. deletes) the matched files from their source directories

To keep things simple, I intend to use a hard coded list of directories and file patterns

This is what I have come up with so far:

    #!/bin/bash
    
    filenames[0]='/home/user1/*.foo'
    filenames[1]='/some/otherpath/*.fbar'
    
    for f in ${filenames[@]}
       do
          echo ""$f""
    done


However, I am unusure on how to proceed from this point onward. Specifically, I need help on:

1. How to glob the files matching the pattern $f
2. How to add the ENTIRE list of matching files (i.e. from all directories) to a tar file in one go


Regarding deleting the files, I am thinking of simply iterating through the ENTIRE list obtained in step 2 above, and 'rm' the actual file - is there a better/quicker/more elegant way?

I am running this on Ubuntu 10.0.4 LTS",1

I use these religiously throughout all my scripts (70+ now), just for fun, to easily separate data and to organize better.

Below are the color functions that I use regularly... wrote them years ago and have gotten so used to them that they're a regular part of my scripting. They function as `printf` substitutes, so rather than boring old `printf ""Hello\n""`, a green hello simply `Tgreen ""Hello\n""` Just stick this code block into your .bashrc file, start a new session, and you're set!  Hell stick some into your PSn variables for easy color prompts. For instance, here is my select prompt: `export PS3=""$(Tmagenta '  〔Select〕 ')""`, and my sudo prompt: `export SUDO_PROMPT=""    $(Tgreen '〔Password〕') ""`. These are the ones I use:

The only thing to keep in mind is when wanting a `%` percent sign or a `\` backslash, you need to double them up inside:<BR>
like:  `printf ""$(Tblue ""%%s"")\n"" 'hi'` <BR>
but not for `Tblue ""%s\n"" 'hi'`<BR>
or `printf ""$(Tblue ""%s"" 'hi')\n""`<BR>

Since these use printf, you can do stuff like:
	printf ""hi $(Tred there) man $(BaquaI ""%c"" '!') $(Bold 'This \\t is %%s') %s\n"" ""$(BgreenB 'super')"" ""$(Bblue mega Colorful)""
or in an echo:
	echo ""hi $(Tred there) man $(BaquaI ""%c"" '!') $(Bold 'This \\t is %s' ""$(BblackB 'super')"") $(Bblue mega Colorful)""
A more useful example:
	printf ""\t%s Volume \""%s\"" is not connected.\n"" ""$(TwhiteB [)$(TredB Error)$(TwhiteB \]:)"" ""$(Tbrown $Volume)""
Or with other commands:
	eval ""echo 'This is OSX' | sed 's:OSX:$(Invert [)$(TaquaF OSX)$(Invert ]):'""
Or something with a bit more swank:
	find . -exec stat -f ""Name: $(Tbrown %%N)%t%t$(Tpurple ""->"")%tPermissions: $(Tgreen %%Sp)"" {} \;

Use your imagination! Feel free all to use these...

**Some may say, what's the use of invisible text?**<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;–– Not much, really... but it's there. I have used it a few times, but only to line up text when <I>""drawing""</I> with Unicode characters...
<HR>
<H2>Now for my questions...</H2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>1) The meta-question:</STRONG> If anyone out there feels like typing up a continuation of what I've started, can you please use the format above? or at least a similar format? Some examples are:

	TgreenBU			## Bold, underlined, green text ##
	TcyanBUFBblackI		## Bold cyan/aqua text that's underlined and flashing on an inverted black background ##

And so on... make up your own names so that it's possible to have all the permutations with minimal, yet clear parameter names. These are examples, but I haven't looked to see if these names conflict with others...
If someone out there likes these functions, uses them regularly, has some time, and woud like to give back something, can this mythical person please **post them for me on this question as a reply or email them to me at *[mdouglas34@hotmail.com]*[1]**. I'm too lazy to type up <I>all</I> the possibilities (I've quickly calculated over 7000 of them, but there may be many, many more if I missed something).<BR>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>2) The main question:</STRONG> Since I use these **`Color Functions`** all the time... in every script, I need to know something about another user's terminal:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Is there any way to determine the background color of a terminal** (without looking at it directly obviously)?<BR><BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Can any other information be gleaned? Like if the terminal is set to handle colors? Perhaps their LSCOLORS or something to give hints at their terminal capabilities/settings?** I guess `$TERM` if set to `xterm-color`, that's a dead giveaway that colors are possible... but what are the capabilities of other terminals? Can `rxvt` produce the same colors? How is `xterm-256color` relate to this? can more colors be used than the standard 8? and 8 bold?<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;basically, I want to write code that spits out color output and is suitable on any system running any terminal, with any setting. **Is there any way to get this information or is this only a pipe dream?**


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally... **What about fonts? do all terminals use proportional/monospaced fonts? Is there any way to determine if a user has, say, unicode support?** It would be nice to konw if certain pretty yet fancy characters are not going to display property as they could be swapped with uglier, yet simpler characters.<BR><BR>

<H4>So basically, I'm looking for many ways to scan a non-local user's settings, environment, so that pretty-print code would be ported elsewhere.</H4>
Is there software writted for this purpose out there that I don't know of?

Sorry for all the questions... some precise, others a bit vague... I hope there will be lots of answers for me to pool together. Porting pretty-print is a major challenge in the unix world... I hope to make a dent in this battleship of a problem.

In the mean time all, feel free all to use my `Color Functions` as you see fit!

Enjoy!

Also, large list of Color Functions written by Aesthir, enjoy? Although this isn't a specific question, I do have one.... but first, I'd like to share `[ Aesthir's Color Functions™ ]`... —— it's not really trademarked ;^) —— with all the shell-coders out there who would like things to look a bit nicer.  I use these religiously throughout all my scripts (70+ now), just for fun, to easily separate data and to organize better.

Below are the color functions that I use regularly... wrote them years ago and have gotten so used to them that they're a regular part of my scripting. They function as `printf` substitutes, so rather than boring old `printf ""Hello\n""`, a green hello simply `Tgreen ""Hello\n""` Just stick this code block into your .bashrc file, start a new session, and you're set!  Hell stick some into your PSn variables for easy color prompts. For instance, here is my select prompt: `export PS3=""$(Tmagenta '  〔Select〕 ')""`, and my sudo prompt: `export SUDO_PROMPT=""    $(Tgreen '〔Password〕') ""`. These are the ones I use:

The only thing to keep in mind is when wanting a `%` percent sign or a `\` backslash, you need to double them up inside:<BR>
like:  `printf ""$(Tblue ""%%s"")\n"" 'hi'` <BR>
but not for `Tblue ""%s\n"" 'hi'`<BR>
or `printf ""$(Tblue ""%s"" 'hi')\n""`<BR>

Since these use printf, you can do stuff like:
	printf ""hi $(Tred there) man $(BaquaI ""%c"" '!') $(Bold 'This \\t is %%s') %s\n"" ""$(BgreenB 'super')"" ""$(Bblue mega Colorful)""
or in an echo:
	echo ""hi $(Tred there) man $(BaquaI ""%c"" '!') $(Bold 'This \\t is %s' ""$(BblackB 'super')"") $(Bblue mega Colorful)""
A more useful example:
	printf ""\t%s Volume \""%s\"" is not connected.\n"" ""$(TwhiteB [)$(TredB Error)$(TwhiteB \]:)"" ""$(Tbrown $Volume)""
Or with other commands:
	eval ""echo 'This is OSX' | sed 's:OSX:$(Invert [)$(TaquaF OSX)$(Invert ]):'""
Or something with a bit more swank:
	find . -exec stat -f ""Name: $(Tbrown %%N)%t%t$(Tpurple ""->"")%tPermissions: $(Tgreen %%Sp)"" {} \;

Use your imagination! Feel free all to use these...

**Some may say, what's the use of invisible text?**<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;–– Not much, really... but it's there. I have used it a few times, but only to line up text when <I>""drawing""</I> with Unicode characters...
<HR>
<H2>Now for my questions...</H2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>1) The meta-question:</STRONG> If anyone out there feels like typing up a continuation of what I've started, can you please use the format above? or at least a similar format? Some examples are:

	TgreenBU			## Bold, underlined, green text ##
	TcyanBUFBblackI		## Bold cyan/aqua text that's underlined and flashing on an inverted black background ##

And so on... make up your own names so that it's possible to have all the permutations with minimal, yet clear parameter names. These are examples, but I haven't looked to see if these names conflict with others...
If someone out there likes these functions, uses them regularly, has some time, and woud like to give back something, can this mythical person please **post them for me on this question as a reply or email them to me at *[mdouglas34@hotmail.com]*[1]**. I'm too lazy to type up <I>all</I> the possibilities (I've quickly calculated over 7000 of them, but there may be many, many more if I missed something).<BR>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>2) The main question:</STRONG> Since I use these **`Color Functions`** all the time... in every script, I need to know something about another user's terminal:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Is there any way to determine the background color of a terminal** (without looking at it directly obviously)?<BR><BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Can any other information be gleaned? Like if the terminal is set to handle colors? Perhaps their LSCOLORS or something to give hints at their terminal capabilities/settings?** I guess `$TERM` if set to `xterm-color`, that's a dead giveaway that colors are possible... but what are the capabilities of other terminals? Can `rxvt` produce the same colors? How is `xterm-256color` relate to this? can more colors be used than the standard 8? and 8 bold?<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;basically, I want to write code that spits out color output and is suitable on any system running any terminal, with any setting. **Is there any way to get this information or is this only a pipe dream?**


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally... **What about fonts? do all terminals use proportional/monospaced fonts? Is there any way to determine if a user has, say, unicode support?** It would be nice to konw if certain pretty yet fancy characters are not going to display property as they could be swapped with uglier, yet simpler characters.<BR><BR>

<H4>So basically, I'm looking for many ways to scan a non-local user's settings, environment, so that pretty-print code would be ported elsewhere.</H4>
Is there software writted for this purpose out there that I don't know of?

Sorry for all the questions... some precise, others a bit vague... I hope there will be lots of answers for me to pool together. Porting pretty-print is a major challenge in the unix world... I hope to make a dent in this battleship of a problem.

In the mean time all, feel free all to use my `Color Functions` as you see fit!

Enjoy!

<code>ssh blah_server (<br>
ls some_folder;<br>
./someaction.sh<br>
pwd;<br>
)<br><br></code>
Basically, I'll be happy with any solution as long as it's clean. Thanks in advance!",3

However, I have to admit that this syntax is the weirdest style I have ever seen in a rather commonly used language. Did the shell take this syntax from an older language that it descents from? Is there a special implication / meaning in the syntax?

Looking at this, firstly I can see that `case` ends with `esac`, which is its reversed form (like `if` ending in `fi`). Secondly I understand that each case is followed by a `)`. Fair enough, but why on earth do I need two `;` at the end of each statement? I would also say that the `)` without an accompanying `(` is ugly.

I'm looking for more information about the historical aspect of the language, but I'm open for technical reasons as well.

    case ""$1"" in
        start)
            start
            ;;
        stop)
            stop
            ;;
        restart)
            stop
            start
            ;;
        status)
            check_status
            ;;
        *)
            echo ""Usage: $0 {start|stop|restart|status}""
            exit 1
            ;;
    esac

Looking at this, firstly I can see that `case` ends with `esac`, which is its reversed form (like `if` ending in `fi`). Secondly I understand that each case is followed by a `)`. Fair enough, but why on earth do I need two `;` at the end of each statement? I would also say that the `)` without an accompanying `(` is ugly.

I'm looking for more information about the historical aspect of the language, but I'm open for technical reasons as well.

And, before I get people yelling at me for all the 'sleeps', I had to have a way to show progress of the script because the people running it will not have any idea what they are doing (they just read keystrokes from a checklist and check off when something has been done). 

So, I needed a nice, clean, easy way for them to 1) see what is happening in plain English (i.e. 'done', or 'skipped') and 2) visualize that the script is still running, even if nothing is displayed on screen.

Last, I cannot make a global change to the way I am showing progress, there is too much code to have to make changes to everything it does. But, if that is the absolute only answer, I guess that may be what I have to do...some day...

",bash,loops,script,while-loops,yum,,open,0,566,15,"How do I echo a period every 2 seconds while 'yum -y update' is running? I am writing a script to do some default configuration of customers' servers, and have it nearly working 100%.

What I cannot figure out is how to run `yum -y update` in some kind of a loop that echoes a ""."" every two seconds while it is updating.

Here is a code example to help explain a little more

    while [ yum -y update > $YUMLOG 2>&1 ]

Obviously, that doesn't work, but I don't know what changes to make so that it *does* work. I have other parts in the code that give me this 'progress bar' effect, but nothing inside of a loop. For example:

    if [ $SETXENNET != ""y"" ]; then
