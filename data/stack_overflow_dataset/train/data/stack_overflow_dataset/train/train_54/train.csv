    tvwSegments.DataContext = queryResults;
        
This works.

However if I used a Typed Data Template (by replacing the x:Key with the DataType attribute on the template, the items all show up with `ICTemplates.Segment` (the ToString() return value)    
The concept is that it should pick up the data template automatically if the Type matches. Can someone spot the mistake here?

Here's the problem:<br />
Consider a (Control|Data)Template with a Trigger that switches visibility of some inner UI elements. E.g. show a TextBlock when IsReadOnly==true and show a TextBox when IsReadOnly==false.

Everything is perfect if you do this without animation - one or two setters would do the job. But what if you want a fancy animation? Then you would specify which animations to start in EnterActions and ExitActions.

But the problem is what exactly the animations should do? Modifying width/height seems really ugly, because fixed sizes in WPF are almost always a wrong way to go and also it's absolutely unflexible.

So far, the best I've come up with is modifying MaxHeight/MaxWidth to some extent, this gives just a little more flexibility but still seems brutal.

I am writing a WPF application and attempting to use an MVVM pattern (first time using this pattern).

My domain object, Viper, has several properties and collections and is used throughout several existing applications. I have now implemented INotifyPropertyChanged on all properties I want to bind in my new WPF app. I am now creating a view model to sit between the domain object and the WPF view. Problem is that all of the properties that are collections in the Viper object are Lists not ObservableCollections. I cannot simply make them ObservableCollections as this will impact all other applications using this object model (does not support things like AddRange, etc). 

This new WPF app maintains a list of Viper objects that will be used (via a view model) to control the GUI. To make things a little more complicated, the app will receive data in the form of a List<Viper> data. The app loops through this list of Viper objects and merges each incoming Viper data into an existing Viper (by index). So lets say my incoming Viper object adds an item to the Events property of an existing Viper (List<Event>), since this is not an ObservableCollection the GUI will not update the grid of events. Even if I convert the List<Event> to OC<Event> in the view model it's the underlying Viper object that does this merge of all the properties and collections, not the view model so still the modification fires no event since the view models OC was not updated. The Viper object and all sub-objects implement a custom MergeWith() function that determines how incoming data should merge. Some perform a replace, some append, some update.

Now, the problem is, requirement of navigation layout and logic keeps on changing. 
Today the navigation logic is hard-coded in ViewModel by bindings.
I'm wondering, is there a good design pattern can make this easy?

For example, there's a horizontal bar on the top as 1st level navigation, then a vertical Accordion control on the left as 2nd & 3rd level navigation, and some CollapsiblePanels on the main area as 4th level navigation.

Whenever any navigation element is clicked, a ViewModel property is set, so that binding triggers Views refresh.

Our requirement guys keeps on changing ideas on how a business logic part (take it as a user control) shall be on 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th level: Yesterday UserControlA might be inside a CollapsiblePanel, so it's a 4th level navigation; today it may be promoted to a 2nd level item, due to some users' request.

I won't blame requirement engineers, as it shall be possible to design a delicate navigation framework in a MVVM project, to make the GUI layout change easy, or even configurable.

Any suggestion? Code samples are most welcome!

The data needed to calculate the grouping and sorting order is not available as simple properties - there needs to be some work done in code to calculate the order and groups.

CollectionViewSource lets me define custom filter and sort logic - so far so good. It also lets me bind GroupDescriptions to a value converter so that I can generate the group names.

The last thing I want to do is control the order that the generated groups appear and this is causing me pain!

Everything I see about [CollectionViewSource.SortDescriptions][1] says that it will sort groups by a **property** name, but I don't have a property available to sort by. SortDescriptions can't be bound to a value converter like GroupDescriptions can and I'm out of other ideas.

This works fine and there is nothing too much wrong here, but it is a fairly simple case. What happens if I want to have the IsFocused style state listed as a exsplicit style how do reference that style as being the IsFocused style, i.e. 

    <Style x:key=""ActiveStyle"" TargetType=""{x:Type TextBox}"">
        <Setter Property=""BorderBrush"" Value=""Green"" />
        <Setter Property=""BorderThickness"" Value=""2"" />
    </Style>

    <Style TargetType=""{x:Type TextBox}"">
        <Setter Property=""BorderThickness"" Value=""1"" />
        <Setter Property=""BorderBrush"" Value=""Gray"" />
        <Style.Triggers>
            <Trigger Property=""IsFocused"" Value=""true"">
               -- Here I want to reference ActiveStyle and not copy the copy the setters
            </Trigger>

One issue I'm having is with DataGrids. Currently, every time the user selects a cell, all screen readers starts saying the entire type name of the cell, which is quite long and confusing. I've compared this behavior with Excel, and in Excel the narrator says 1) the content of the cell 2) the coordinates of the cell, and that's it.

I would like if I could specify a similar behavior: 1) the content of the cell 2) the header of the row.

The only similar question I've found was [here][1], but after applying this solution the narrator would say 1) the specified AutomationProperties.Name of the cell 2) the full type name 3) and only then the content.

I might be able to do away with DataGrids entirely, but I'd rather make this work. Thanks for the help!

Although I have samples for simple animations for buttons like growing, or having the color fade into something brighter on click but what I am looking for is some showcase button animations and some showcase panel change animations to show off the best features of WPF.  Normally I would go for the more subtle changes, but in a couple of cases I need something to really show off the advantages of using WPF over WinForms technology.

Can anyone point me at some button samples and/or panel changing (switching from one panel to the next in a navigation) that really shows of WPF and has that **wow** factor.

which inherits from the original grid and enables dragging and resizing its child elements.
I need to bind a custom DP named **`WorkItemsProperty`** to an observable collection of type **`WorkItem`** (implements `INotifyPropertyChanged`). Each element in the grid is bound to a collection item.

Whenever the user adds a new item dynamically at runtime (the items cannot be declared in XAML!), or deletes an item from that collection, the `WorkItems` DP on the DragGrid should be updated, and the children in the grid (where each child represents a `WorkItem` collection item).

My question is how does the DP notify the control about which child element in the grid must be **removed**, **changed** ('change' means user dragged an element, or resized it with the mouse) or **added**, and how would I identify which one of the existing children is the one that needs to be deleted or changed.
I understand that this is where the DependencyPropertyChangedCallback comes in. But that only gets called when the DP property is set anew, not when something inside the collection changes (like add, remove item). So in the end, does the `DragGrid` control somehow need to subscribe to the CollectionChanged event? At what point would I hook up the event handler for that?

The super simple objects within the Collection are ""SingleItems"" which are defined like this:

    public class SingleItem {
    private String _name=null;

    public String Name {
      get { return _name; }
      set { _name=value; }
    }
    
    public SingleItem(String name) {
      Name=name;
    }
  
The class ManyItems hosts the Collection and is defined like this:

    public class ManyItems{
    private ObservableCollection<SingleItem> allItems=new ObservableCollection<SingleItem>();
    

    public ManyItems() {
      AllItems.Add(new SingleItem(""inside""));//debug code
    }

      set { allItems=value; }
    }

    public void AddItem(SingleItem item) {
      AllItems.Add(item);
    }

In my main window I just want to update ManyItems when the user presses a button:

    public partial class MainWindow : Window{
    int count=0;
    ManyItems _items=new ManyItems();

    public ManyItems Items {
      get { return _items; }

    public MainWindow(){
	this.InitializeComponent();
    }

    private void Button_Click(object sender, System.Windows.RoutedEventArgs e){
	Items.AddItem(new SingleItem(""name_""+count));
	count++;
    }
   }

Finally my XAML looks like this (shortened where ""...""):

When I run this app, the grid shows the SingleItem ""inside"" which I created in the constructor. However no changes to the underlying Collections are reflected in the datagrid. I tried also to use INotifyPropertyChanged but without success. I think I have a grave error in my understanding.
Can anybody explain me what I am doing wrong? Also online examples (where not everything is done inside constructors) are greatly appreciated.

    GroupSettingsList.CollectionChanged += new NotifyCollectionChangedEventHandler(this.ContentCollectionChanged);

GroupSettingsList is a DeeplyObservableCollection and ContentCollectionChanged is a CollectionChanged eventhandler. I don't get any errors but my method never gets called and I'm not sure why.

",wpf,,,,,,open,0,586,8,"Why isn't my CollectionChanged event handler getting called? I have done some research and other answers on stackoverflow indicate that I need to extend the ObservableCollection<T> class to add PropertyChanged event handlers to each item when an item is added or removed in order to get events when the contents of an item in the collection change... a bit annoying really, but I've implemented this class based on some of those answers:

        public class DeeplyObservableCollection<T> : ObservableCollection<T>

A brief recap:  I want to create a base ItemViewModelBase class that exposes properties that my view will bind to.  Then I will create two specific view models, PeopleViewModel and CarsViewModel.  Both of these inherit from ItemViewModelBase and implement the appropriate properties.  Now, I want to be able to create a single view that will display the appropriate info based on which view model it is bound to.  Since both the PeopleViewModel and CarsViewModel expose the same properties and I want the view to look the same for both of these, I only need one view.

One of the answers in my previous question suggested using a DataTemplate:

    <DataTemplate DataType=""{x:Type ItemViewModelBase}"">
       //some user control
    </DataTemplate>

I am new to using DataTemplates with MVVM (and MVVM in general) so I have a few questions:

Right now ItemViewModelBase is an abstract class and I defined the appropriate properties (ItemName, Items, etc.). My Items property is an ObservableCollection: 


    public virtual ObservableCollection<???> Items { get; set; }

- What would I put as the collection type? The classes that derive from this base class will have different lists (Person, Car). Is the base view model the right place to put the property? I do want all of the derived classes to implement it so it seems so.  ANd it doesn't make sense to have Person and Car extend some base object.

- Let's say I do not need any customization of my views. I would only need one View in that case. It is not clear how I would set this up. Should I create a DataTemplate for ItemViewModelBase and a single view (user control) to represent it? Right now I use Unity to register my view models and when the view is created, the view model gets injected in the view. How would I differentiate between the different view models when I try to create the view?

Basically, I don't know how to show the appropriate view when using DataTemplates.  In my application right now I have a window that contains a tab control defined like this:

    <Grid>
        <TabControl TabStripPlacement=""Left"" ItemsSource=""{Binding TabItems}""/>
    </Grid>

The TabControl's style contains the below setters:

    <Setter Property=""Header"" Value=""{Binding Header}""/>
    <Setter Property=""Content"" Value=""{Binding Content}""/>

TabItems is defined like so:

    public ObservableCollection<ConfigTabItem> TabItems { get; set; }
    
    TabItems.Add(new ConfigTabItem() { Header = ""People"", ResolveView = (Func<object>)(() => (PeopleView)Container.Resolve(typeof(PeopleView), ""peopleView"")) });
    TabItems.Add(new ConfigTabItem() { Header = ""Cars"", ResolveView = (Func<object>)(() => (CarsView)ConfigurationModule.Container.Resolve(typeof(CarsView), ""carsView"")) });


So as it stands right now, I have separate view models and views for People and Cars, and whenever a tab is clicked, the appropriate view is resolved.

I want to change this setup to use the above mentioned base view model class and single view with DataTemplates.

Any sample code/sample would be greatly appreciated, showing a base view model class, some other view model classes extending that base view model, and then being able to show the appropriate view based on the view model (where there is only one generic view).

Now, I want to be able to create a single view that will display the appropriate info based on which view model it is bound to.  Since both the PeopleViewModel and CarsViewModel expose the same properties and I want the view to look the same for both of these, I only need one view.

One of the answers in my previous question suggested using a DataTemplate:

    <DataTemplate DataType=""{x:Type ItemViewModelBase}"">
       //some user control
    </DataTemplate>

I am new to using DataTemplates with MVVM (and MVVM in general) so I have a few questions:

Right now ItemViewModelBase is an abstract class and I defined the appropriate properties (ItemName, Items, etc.). My Items property is an ObservableCollection: 


    public virtual ObservableCollection<???> Items { get; set; }

- What would I put as the collection type? The classes that derive from this base class will have different lists (Person, Car). Is the base view model the right place to put the property? I do want all of the derived classes to implement it so it seems so.  ANd it doesn't make sense to have Person and Car extend some base object.

- Let's say I do not need any customization of my views. I would only need one View in that case. It is not clear how I would set this up. Should I create a DataTemplate for ItemViewModelBase and a single view (user control) to represent it? Right now I use Unity to register my view models and when the view is created, the view model gets injected in the view. How would I differentiate between the different view models when I try to create the view?

Basically, I don't know how to show the appropriate view when using DataTemplates.  In my application right now I have a window that contains a tab control defined like this:

    <Grid>
        <TabControl TabStripPlacement=""Left"" ItemsSource=""{Binding TabItems}""/>
    </Grid>

The TabControl's style contains the below setters:

    <Setter Property=""Header"" Value=""{Binding Header}""/>
    <Setter Property=""Content"" Value=""{Binding Content}""/>

TabItems is defined like so:

    public ObservableCollection<ConfigTabItem> TabItems { get; set; }
    
    TabItems.Add(new ConfigTabItem() { Header = ""People"", ResolveView = (Func<object>)(() => (PeopleView)Container.Resolve(typeof(PeopleView), ""peopleView"")) });
    TabItems.Add(new ConfigTabItem() { Header = ""Cars"", ResolveView = (Func<object>)(() => (CarsView)ConfigurationModule.Container.Resolve(typeof(CarsView), ""carsView"")) });


So as it stands right now, I have separate view models and views for People and Cars, and whenever a tab is clicked, the appropriate view is resolved.

I want to change this setup to use the above mentioned base view model class and single view with DataTemplates.

Any sample code/sample would be greatly appreciated, showing a base view model class, some other view model classes extending that base view model, and then being able to show the appropriate view based on the view model (where there is only one generic view).

So my question is how to remove this opacity gradient clipping or whatever wpf doing?",wpf,xaml,progress-bar,,,,open,0,72,6,"Why WPF ProgressBar PART_Indicator adding opacity?

Everything behaves as expected, except that the main window's height is way too large. It doesn't seem to fit just its content, but rather extends almost the entire height of the monitor. I went through the code to make sure VerticalAlignments are set to Top (rather than Stretch) and that the Height properties are set to Auto except for the description text box which has an explicit height.

for each tab i have different buttons that i need

plus there are several buttons that should always be in the ribbon (settings, about, new appointment...)

the best would be if i can add the RibbonTabs directly in the usercontrols and somehow merge them auto-magically with the main ribbon at runtime depending on the visible tab

if thats not possible then there is something called  ContextualTabGroups, but for the life of me cant find any info on how to bind/trigger the different ribbons to certain cirmcumstances/childcontrols or whatever.

For my model I am using linq to sql objects.  I also have a data service class that will supply the view model with the model objects and handle CRUD operations.

I have an idea how basic database updates will happen in my data service.  Something like this:

        public void SaveProduct(Product product) {
            if (product.ID > 0) {
                dc.Products.Attach(product, true);

            dc.SubmitChanges();
        }

In my application a product has many sub entityset objects, such as pricing, order history, etc.  My question is, if my view model exposes a Product object to bind to a view, how will/should the entityset objects be handled?  I would want the product details bound to textboxes at the top of the view and then grids for the entitysets.  From my understanding entitysets don't support 2 way binding.  How can I bind a product object to the view (sub entitysets and all) and save it back to the database?

This application has dozens of model objects with sub objects, so the more painless the solution the better.

For my model I am using linq to sql objects.  I also have a data service class that will supply the view model with the model objects and handle CRUD operations.

I have an idea how basic database updates will happen in my data service.  Something like this:

        public void SaveProduct(Product product) {
            if (product.ID > 0) {
                dc.Products.Attach(product, true);
            } else {
                dc.Products.InsertOnSubmit(product);
            }
            dc.SubmitChanges();
        }

In my application a product has many sub entityset objects, such as pricing, order history, etc.  My question is, if my view model exposes a Product object to bind to a view, how will/should the entityset objects be handled?  I would want the product details bound to textboxes at the top of the view and then grids for the entitysets.  From my understanding entitysets don't support 2 way binding.  How can I bind a product object to the view (sub entitysets and all) and save it back to the database?

By some reason my popup(PART_Popup) isn't the same width as toggleButton. It has width enough for displaying item. If I don't override template popup is the same width as toggleButton. So I can't understand why I can't get the same situation with standart template",wpf,silverlight,templates,combobox,,,open,0,6059,5,"Default combobox template. Popup width I want add some buttons to default combobox template, so I override its template.

I use this:

The WPF Snoop utility indicates textBox1 is a child of AdornerDecorator (as you would expect) but also that the AdornerLayer that AdornerDecorator creates is also a child. As a custom adorner added to the AdornerLayer can be displayed 'outside' the textbox, the AdornerLayer's drawing surface must stretch outside too (presumably all over the window). 

So, what real significance does the placement of AdornerDecorator have (given we bind a UI element to the custom adorner, which we place in the AdornerLayer)? I know AdornerLayer.GetAdorner(textBox1) will get the first adorner layer in the visual tree up from textbox1, but what does it matter where that is (as the custom ardorner gets added to the layer and the custom ardoner knows which element it is bound to)?

This is also consistent with my knowledge that control cannot 'leave' it's designated space (in other words, we don't have position: relative; in wpf - the first tabcontrol looks like it had this css: `tab:active { position: relative; top: 1px; }`).

So, my question is: how did Microsoft devs do this, and how can I replicate the overlapped look? Thanks!

Background:

We've developed a WPF application for controlling a dynamic display.  There is a Design component, where the user lays out the display document, and a document Display component.

Elements in the display can contain text and/or graphics.  Each element can cycle through different strings or images using various transitions--scrolling, fading, flashing, etc.

Problem: 

The problem  is with an element displaying graphics, with a cross-fade between different graphics.  The fade is accomplished by animating the opacity property of two WPF image controls (one for incoming, one for outgoing). 

Everything works fine as long as the total memory footprint of the application while running is below a (not yet precisely defined) threshold.  When the total foot print increases (for example, by adding another graphic element with a large graphic) then the total memory used by the application begins to grow, and I'm eventually presented with an OOM exception.  The large graphic on its own, or the fading graphics on its own do not have the memory leak problem, but only the combination.

Has anyone else seen similar behavior?  Any ideas for a solution?  I'm guessing that the problem has something to do with Large Object Heap fragmentation, but this is only a guess.

Unfortunately, I don't have sample code to post as this is part of a larger solution.  I will try to create a sample app that illustrates this behavior and update my post.

Didn't copy all xaml code, like Grid.RowDefinitions and Grid.ColumnDefinitions. On Button_Click I just say `NewAnimalWindow n = new NewAnimalWindow(); n.ShowDialog();`.

NewAnimalWindow just have two textboxes for name and weight, combobox for animal type and button ""Save animal"" on which I want to add animal to collection of animal in parent window.

My app would have a window with a canvas where I can place one or more ""widget"" user controls, which can be dragged around and resized. All widgets will have a common ""chrome"", perhaps with buttons along the top to maximise/minimise, open a configuration dialog, etc.

In my winform days I would have created a base class user control containing the common UI elements, with each widget user control inheriting from this, however I believe WPF has no equivalent of user control inheritance.

So I'm looking for pointers to get me started. Does the answer lie in templates, user controls, both? Any code snippets or examples would be greatly appreciated!

To get an idea of what I'm looking for, take a look at the ""Chronos WPF"" framework on Codeplex - http://chronoswpf.codeplex.com/. It's a widget framework and more - I tried in vain to unpick the widget stuff but the source is a huge beast and is also intertwined with a composite application framework. Alas it's no longer being actively developed either.

Thanks in advance

The problem:

To perform a data bind, you'll have to do some stuff in code behind (set a dependency property), which sometimes may be clear, and sometimes not. Then you'll have to find out how the hell to access the values from your dependency property (the object you're trying to use). Then, ok, you spent some time deciding that you'll access it through ElementName or Ancestor or whatever (because you'll have to find out by yourself how this works, Microsoft's documentation on that is pretty lame, it's not straight forward).

Then, ok, you spent some time and now your data binding is working, except that is not. Because the class of the object you're binding to must implement INotifyPropertyChanged. Just that. Or not, because you'll have to assure that an event (`OnPropertyChanged`) must be triggered in order to update the values on your interface ... by sending as an argument a string containing THE NAME OF THE EFFING PROPERTY. That's as lame as JSF's way to access values (obliging the developer to have getters and setters exactly the way they want). An also, if you're building your software in layers, forget, you'll have to implement INotifyPropertyChange every-effing-where.

I'm writing this because I want to know if:

 - I'm doing everything wrong and that's why I don't get the point.
 - Is there a better solution to deal with this kind of stuff?
 - Am I the only one who thinks that it doesn't make any sense?

Before anyone asks: Yes, I understand that the event makes ""some"" sense, because there must be a way to know that the object changed. But I don't see much difference of using that or just calling an `Update` method every time I do anything in the interface. I hope you guys don't think I'm stupid for posting this ... I'm a pretty new programmer (3 years since my graduation began and 2 years working experience), but the lack of a better way to do that kind of stuff doesn't look like, for instance, Microsoft's ASP.NET MVC, which just works magically. I'm not asking for everything to be easy, just asking for a better documentation, and, I don't know, an easier (by easier I mean more straight-forward) way to do something that you're supposed to do when using the framework, something that is considered elegant.

I'm attempting to write a useful database app for my business as a learning project. I did a draft in WinForms, referring to the (very good) Murach book, but am now trying to re-write it with a WPF UI and cleaner code.

I think I understand the basics of WPF binding, but am tearing my hair out trying to find a simple way of binding to parent details - which I would have thought was a very basic scenario, but I can't find anything on it. For example, let's say I have

- a 'Customers' table with CustomerID, Name, various contact details and then foreign keys CityID and GroupID;
- a 'City' table with CityID, CityName and foreign key StateID;
- a 'State' table with StateID, StateName;
- a 'Groups' table with GroupID, GroupName etc.

...with a strongly typed dataset including relationships and a bunch of tableadapters.

All I want to do in this case is display the details for a specific Customer (when the user has entered their CustomerID). I can easily bind to the data in the 'Customers' table, but **how do I use bindings to retrieve the CityName, StateName and GroupName from the related tables?** A partial example below.

...

    <Window.Resources>
        <CollectionViewSource x:Key=""CustomersViewSource"" 
                                Source=""{Binding Path=Customers,Source={StaticResource CustomersDataSet}}"" />
    </Window.Resources>
    <Grid DataContext=""{Binding Source={StaticResource CustomersViewSource}}"">
        <TextBox Name=""customerName"" Text=""{Binding Path=Name}"" />
        <TextBox Name=""customerPhone"" Text=""{Binding Path=PhoneNumber}"" />
    </Grid>
    <Grid>
        <Label Name=""lblGroup"" Content=""[needs to bind to GroupName]"">
        <Label Name=""lblCity"" Content=""[needs to bind to CityName]"">
    </Grid>

I've read articles on setting up master/detail scenarios, which is straightforward, so I could bind customers into a datagrid for a selected city, for example, by using the foreign key as the binding path for the customer control. Here I'm trying to do it back the other way, though, looking up the parent details based on a selected customer. Can anyone nudge me in the right direction?

Failing this, I've only been able to do it through VB - and it's pretty nasty. Assuming that I've created a CustomerViewSource and looked up the relevant customer, and filled the various tables in my dataset, something like this:

    Dim rowCustomer As System.Data.DataRowView = CustomerViewSource.View.CurrentItem
    Dim drCustomer As System.Data.Datarow = rowCustomer.Row
    Dim drGroup as drCustomer.GetParentRow(""FK_Customers_Groups"")
    lblGroup.Content = drGroup.Item(""GroupName"")

I shouldn't have to do this so clumsily though... should I?

One more thing: at the moment I'm selecting a customer by filling the dataset using a parameterized query on the tableadapter, e.g.

    SELECT CustomerID, CustomerName
    FROM Customers
    WHERE CustomerID = @CustomerID

And then just moving to the first record (as there will only be one). Is this a normal method of looking up a customer? I could also use this method by getting the foreign keys from my customer row and filling the different tables in the dataset all using parameterised queries, then just binding to each table separately - but again, seems very messy.

Any help with this problem, or even general advice, hugely appreciated. If I haven't been clear enough (or provided good examples), happy to explain further. Cheers.

and I'm trying to load this into a WPF DataGrid using a DataSet/DataView. Sure enough, OutOfMemoryException was fired when trying to bind to this as so:

            <Grid x:Name=""LayoutRoot"">
            <HeaderedContentControl Header=""Sample Data"">

                </DataGrid>
            </HeaderedContentControl>
        </Grid>

I tried adding the VirtualizingStackPanel.IsVirtualizing=""True"" (although that's the default) and also VirtualizingStackPanel.VirtualizationMode=""Recycling"", but it didn't help.

I know this is tons of data for the control, I'm wondering what my options are.",4

I have a bigger project in which i'm trying to implement a new WPF window which contains some custom controls. Going deeper this window should looks like, let's say, a calculator. This calculators has many keys buttons which are ""custom controls"" inherited from Controls, and their style are defined in Generic.xaml.
When i try to debug it, the custom controls (the key buttons) don't appear into the calculator window.
I think it's due to something wrong with the Generic.xaml file.
Can someone give me a hint ???
Thanks in advance

To use the logo in other XAML files is it best to define this logo as an element in a ResourceDictionary or create a UserControl?

This seems easy with a UserControl, however I want to load my XAML files in with XamlReader so I would prefer to use resources so that these can be specified within the XAML.  It seems possible to store items such as a Canvas in a ResourceDictionary but I am not sure how to reference them.

For example, I can define my logo as a ResourceDictionary element as follows:

      <ResourceDictionary
            	xmlns=""http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"" 
            	xmlns:x=""http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"">
            	<Canvas x:Name=""LayoutRoot"" x:Key=""Logo"">
                   <!-- My Logo -->
                 </Canvas>
        </ResourceDictionary>

But how can I use this Logo in my other XAML files - maybe I have got the wrong idea about resources?



",wpf,xaml,,,,,open,0,243,4,"ResourceDictionary element or UserControl? I have some XAML to draw a logo and I want to re-use this in various other XAML files (it has no UI and requires no code).  The top level of the logo XAML is a Canvas item.

To use the logo in other XAML files is it best to define this logo as an element in a ResourceDictionary or create a UserControl?

This seems easy with a UserControl, however I want to load my XAML files in with XamlReader so I would prefer to use resources so that these can be specified within the XAML.  It seems possible to store items such as a Canvas in a ResourceDictionary but I am not sure how to reference them.

- If you know the size of the control, remove the Auto and enter the real value, so the parent doesn't have to parse all childs to check the size he needs
- Set the parameter IsHitTestVisible=False if the element doesn't need to be interactive
- Freeze all object that you can
- Use Static resources instead of Dynamic resources
- Don't use the Ellipse object, transform the Ellipse to a Path
- Don't use TextBox or Label if you can use a TextBlock
- Use Canvas instead of Grid when possible
- No FlowDocument
- Virtualize!! VirtualizingStackPanel instead of StackPanel
- Don't use List<T>, the ObservableCollection<T> is way faster

Does viewing xaml in the Visual Studio UI designer execute the code-behind file? 

For the past while whenever I try to view the main xaml file of my WPF application it throws an exception, but because I've been busy with other things I never really looked into it until today. Now I notice that in the exception's call stack it's calling many of the code-behind's methods, including methods like Window_Loaded (!). It's like it's trying to run my application while I'm designing it and obviously failing. 

So I'm also wondering why it does this.

I'm also wondering how exactly I'm supposed to debug this as it's doing all this behind my back.

Does viewing xaml in the Visual Studio UI designer execute the code-behind file? 

For the past while whenever I try to view the main xaml file of my WPF application it throws an exception, but because I've been busy with other things I never really looked into it until today. Now I notice that in the exception's call stack it's calling many of the code-behind's methods, including methods like Window_Loaded (!). It's like it's trying to run my application while I'm designing it and obviously failing. 

So I'm also wondering why it does this.

I'm also wondering how exactly I'm supposed to debug this as it's doing all this behind my back.

This ComboBox should contain two TextBlocks - each bound to a different set of data.



    // SINGLE TEXTBLOCK TEMPLATE
    <DataTemplate x:Key=""SingleCode"">
        <StackPanel Orientation=""Horizontal"">
            <TextBlock Style=""{StaticResource ComboTextBoxStyle}""
                       Text=""{Binding Path=Code.CodeA}""/>
        </StackPanel>
    </DataTemplate>

    // MULTI TEXTBLOCK TEMPLATE
    <DataTemplate x:Key=""MultiCode"">
        <StackPanel Orientation=""Horizontal"">
            <TextBlock Style=""{StaticResource ComboTextBoxStyle}""
                       Text=""{Binding Path=Code.CodeA}""/>
            <TextBlock Style=""{StaticResource ComboTextBoxStyle}""
                       Margin=""11,1,0,1""
                       Text=""{Binding Path=Code.CodeB}""/>
        </StackPanel>
    </DataTemplate>

    // COMBOBOX TEMPLATE
    <DataTemplate x:Key=""dt_Code_dropdown"">
        <ComboBox x:Name=""CodeComboBox"" 
                  ItemsSource=""{Binding Source={StaticResource /*OBJECTDATAPROVIDER*/}}""
                  SelectedItem=""{Binding Path= /*Code.CodeA*/}""
                  Style=""{StaticResource DataGridComboStyle}""
            <ComboBox.ItemTemplate>
                <DataTemplate>
                    <StackPanel>
                        <ContentControl x:Name=""ContentCode"" 
                                        Content=""{Binding}""  
                                        ContentTemplate=""{StaticResource MultiCode}""/>
                    </StackPanel>
                    <DataTemplate.Triggers>
                        <DataTrigger Binding=""{Binding RelativeSource={RelativeSource AncestorType=ComboBoxItem}}"" 
                                     Value=""{x:Null}"">
                            <Setter TargetName=""WBSContentCost""   
                                    Property=""ContentTemplate"" 
                                    Value=""{StaticResource SingleCode}""/>
                        </DataTrigger>
                    </DataTemplate.Triggers>
                </DataTemplate>
            </ComboBox.ItemTemplate>
        </ComboBox>
    </DataTemplate>

The problem I am having is not the changing of the two DataTemplates - that works fine.

The problem comes after the ComboBox has an item selected; if the user (or tester) clicks just outside of the ComboBox, by about 1 - 2 pixels, the Content of the ComboBox disapears!!

This is really bugging me and at first thought it might have something to do with the DataTrigger being used...

            Has anybody come aross this before? 
            Can you help me, please?

RoutedUICommand has its InputGestures property, which makes the command automatically be invoked when I press the keystroke. (As an added bonus, it even makes the keystroke display in the MenuItem.)

It works good, until I set the `Expander.Width` property. e.g. when I set the `Expander.Width` property, the `Header` will not rendered. e.g. The `Expander` wouldnt shot the `Header`. But when I delete the `Width` property, it will show again. Actually I want to force the `Expander.Header` and `Expander.Content` have same `Width`. have you any suggestion? Can you help me please?

It works good, until I set the `Expander.Width` property. e.g. when I set the `Expander.Width` property, the `Header` will not rendered. e.g. The `Expander` wouldnt shot the `Header`. But when I delete the `Width` property, it will show again. Actually I want to force the `Expander.Header` and `Expander.Content` have same `Width`. have you any suggestion? Can you help me please? Thanks in advance.",5

The current setup is as Class Library Project with a public static method. I have added a Windows Form item to the Project. In the public static method I create an instance of the Windows Form Class and use the method ShowDialog.

The reason why I use this setup is that I need my own .net dialog in an other program. This program can only call public static methods i .net.

    'Public logger As log4net.ILog

    Public Event PropertyChanged As PropertyChangedEventHandler Implements INotifyPropertyChanged.PropertyChanged
	
	Private _state As States
    Public Enum States
        State1
		State2
		State3
    End Enum
	
	Public Property State() As States
        Get
            Return _state
        End Get
        Set(ByVal value As States)
            If (value <> _state) Then
                _state = value
                RaiseEvent PropertyChanged(Me, New PropertyChangedEventArgs(""State""))
            End If

        End Set
    End Property
	
	Protected Sub OnPropertyChanged(ByVal name As String)
        RaiseEvent PropertyChanged(Me, New PropertyChangedEventArgs(name))
    End Sub
	
I want to be able to change the state of a business object in the code behind and have that change the colors of multiple shapes in my usercontrol.	I'm not sure about how to do the binding. I set the datacontext of the user control in the code behind but not sure if that's right. I'm new to WPF and programming in general and I'm stuck on where to go from here. Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated!!",4

If I had a WPF triangle being displayed and it will be rotated to some degree around a centrepoint, I can do it one of two ways:

1. Programatically determine the points and their offset in the backend, use XAML to simply place them on the canvas where they belong, it would look like this:

=====
I have a WPF program that I want to print several documents from using some data.  Currently these documents exist as an Excel Spreadsheet and a Word Document.

What I have tried
=====
Opened XPS file (Saved as XPS from Excel) as a zip and pulled out the Page (it only consists of a single page) and slapped it into a Window with a grid, just for a test.  OMG!!  The resources that could not be found and red squiglies every where.  Fonts that are specified in the XPS are represented in a odttf file which WPF does not seem to like.  Renaming it to .ttf doesn't appear to work.  The layout appeared correctly, grid lines and what not, so that is hopeful.

What I really would rather not have to do
====
Recreate the files as flow document, XPS, or other XAML objects by hand.  The layout is pretty involved for the Excel Spreadsheet document.  The Word doc is not so bad.

So really I just need to know.  From the two inputs that I am using (Word Document, Excel Spreadsheet) how best would I get these into a format that I could easily print from WPF.  Currently I have some code snippets that would allow me to open Excel, open the spreadhseet, put the data into the specified cells, print, issue a close command, check that the program unload and kill it if necessary.  I don't want to do that anymore thought.  It is messy and can be buggy as well as requiring the Office Interop assemblies and other crap to be installed.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.  My thanks in advance.

I am creating an MVVM app that executes a task on a background thread, using `Task.Factory.StartNew()` and `Parallel.ForEach()`. I am using [this article][1] as a guide. So far, my code looks like this:

    Task.Factory.StartNew(() => DoWork(fileList, viewModel));

Where `fileList` is a list of files to be processed, and `viewModel` is the view model with the `Progress` property. The `DoWork()` method looks like this, so far:

    private object DoWork(string[] fileList, ProgressDialogViewModel viewModel)
    {
        Parallel.ForEach(fileList, imagePath => ProcessImage(imagePath));
    }

The `ProcessImage()` method does the actual image processing. The view model's `Progress` property is bound to a progress bar in a dialog that is displayed just before the background process begins.

I'd like to update the view model `Progress` property after each iteration of the `Parallel.ForEach()` statement. All I need to do is increment the property value. How do I do that? Thanks for your help.

So when the user selects a value, it saves the value in the Comment property. This works fine if the user selects an item in the list, but if the user types in a new value, the comment property is not updated (it is null because the selected item was not in the list).

Essentially I’m trying to get PopUpButton behavior on each ListItem in my ListBox. When I open the Expander the content is rendering behind everything else as if it were transparent, or lower in the z-order. I’ve tried this with a WPF PopUp and Toggle Button as well (using techniques described int Karle Shivllet’s blog – Expander Control with Popup Content) to no avail.
Let me first describe what it is I’m trying to do. I have two controls that display a list of inputs that I need to configure for my application. For simplicity sake, one user control is used to configure inputs to a graph, and another control is used to control inputs to a simple excel  grid. The inputs for the graph and grid each have properties that need to be configured on them. I’ve developed a simple user control called InputSelectControl that will render a ListBox containing the list of inputs to be configured for the graph or grid. Each ListItem in the ListBox consist of a TextBlock for the input’s name (e.g. Pressure, ECG, etc.) and a WPF Expander that , when clicke, displays a property editor for that input. Since the property editor presentation will be different depending on whether I’m dealing with graph inputs versus grid inputs, I’ve used a DependencyProperty on my InputSelectControl that is of type ControlTemplate. This allows my grid and graph to each supply the presentation they need for editing their input properties. Also note that I will have more than just a graph and a grid that need this behavior, thus the desire to make this a user control that can dynamically receive presentation behavior.
I’ve tried placing my Expander inside my property editor template, had have also tried experimenting with the ZIndex in various places, but always end up with the same behavior, the Expander popup displays behind the ListItems in my list. 
Below is some code further describing my approach. Hopefully someone can help me out of this pickle.

",wpf,contentcontrol,,,,,open,0,2328,11,"WPF Expander in user control getting rendered transparent in ListBox item I’m having issues with a WPF Expander that I have in a user control that gets rendered in a ListBox. Essentially I’m trying to get PopUpButton behavior on each ListItem in my ListBox. When I open the Expander the content is rendering behind everything else as if it were transparent, or lower in the z-order. I’ve tried this with a WPF PopUp and Toggle Button as well (using techniques described int Karle Shivllet’s blog – Expander Control with Popup Content) to no avail.
Let me first describe what it is I’m trying to do. I have two controls that display a list of inputs that I need to configure for my application. For simplicity sake, one user control is used to configure inputs to a graph, and another control is used to control inputs to a simple excel  grid.

I have a Grid with a fixed width and height.  The grid contains one child, a Rectangle.  The Rectangle's Fill is a VisualBrush whose Visual binds to a canvas outside of the grid, whose dimensions are rather large.  On the rectangle, I use a ScaleTransform, with ScaleX and ScaleY both being set to 0.18.  Essentially, I am trying to scale the Rectangle's visual down to fit within my grid.  What appears to be happening is that the Grid itself is being scaled down, resulting in a much smaller result than what I want.  I have included the code below.

From the above code, it seems that the line with comment **Line in Question** is not strongly typed, we need to cast the return from `GetPattern()` method to the required interface and then use it to invoke the specific UI automations.

Would it not have been better if the implementation of the `GetPattern()` method in `WPF` was done using already present `Generics` in .Net Framework as below:

It simply re-templates the `CheckBox` control so that its background is dependent upon its state:

 - Checked = Green
 - Unchecked = Red
 - Checking (transition) = Light Green
 - Unchecking (transition) = Light Red

So, when you check one of the check boxes, you'd expect it to turn light green for a short period, and then turn green. Similarly, when unchecking, you'd expect it to turn light red for a short period, and then turn red.

*And it normally does exactly that. **But not always.***

Play with the program long enough (I can get it in around 30 seconds) and you'll find that the transition animation sometimes trumps that in the visual state. That is, the check box will continue to appear light green when selected, or light red when unselected. Here's a screenshot illustrating what I mean, taken well after the 3 seconds the transition is configured to take:

![enter image description here][1]

When this occurs, it's *not* because the control didn't successfully transition to the target state. It purports to be in the correct state. I verified this by checking the following in the debugger (for the specific case documented by the above screenshot):

    var vsgs = VisualStateManager.GetVisualStateGroups(VisualTreeHelper.GetChild(this.cb2, 0) as FrameworkElement);
    var vsg = vsgs[0];
    // this is correctly reported as ""Unselected""
    var currentState = vsg.CurrentState.Name;

I've read through all the VSM documentation I could find and have not been able to come up with an explanation for this erratic behavior.

So, what is it about the above XAML that is causing this issue?

I think i have to add a new class ... should it has to be a static class, a singleton ... which is the correct way to design it?",2

Also, the top-level [what's new in .NET 4.5 beta][2] page mentions this integration as a new feature.

However, if you go to the docs for [HwndHost itself][5], neither of those properties is present. And they don't appear to be in Visual Studio either.

So it would appear that the rumours are true - it looks like the airspace improvements for interop have been dropped.

The problem is:

 - the toolbar opacity fades out, but it the space it took up is still present after it fades out
 - the initial toolbar status is not in sync with the value of the ViewModel property

But how do I handle the following conditions, in XAML itself, if possible:

- **after** the toolbar (Border) **fades out**, how do I then say ""then and only then Visibility=Collapsed"", e.g. perhaps with a double animation 
- **before** the toolbar **fades in**, how do I say ""Visibilty=Normal""

The user will be able to add ICs onto that breadboard.

I've finished building the breadboard right now, it consists mainly of a grid that has a number of cells equal to the number on nodes on a real breadboard..

And right now I made users add ICs to that grid by specifying the Grid.Row and Grid.Column and determining its size by specifying Grid.RowSpan and Grid.ColumnSpan

[Like this photo..][1]

Here is the C# code:

    
    private int usedVerticalPins = 0;
        void AddICs(int pinNum)
        {
    var rect = new Rectangle() { Fill = new SolidColorBrush(Colors.Black),Stroke = new SolidColorBrush(Colors.White)};
            rect.SetValue(Grid.RowProperty, usedVerticalPins);
            rect.SetValue(Grid.ColumnProperty, 7);

            rect.SetValue(Grid.RowSpanProperty, (pinNum / 2));
            rect.SetValue(Grid.ColumnSpanProperty, 3);

            BreadboardControl.BreadboardGrid.Children.Add(rect);
            usedVerticalPins += (pinNum / 2);

        }

But as you can see, it looks like plain rectangles not as ICs, so I thought of inheriting the class Rectangle and edit the way it looks by I found that it is a sealed class..

I want the ICs to look like [this one][2] with all pins and stuff..

So can you please suggest a way to do it..!?

Currently i can read and import the whole model correctly in WPF but the problem that i'm finding is that the textures in the file isn't what i expect.

Its supposedly easy, but the ""easy"" version assumes that you create the WPF control in the **VSIX project**.

The thing is, I've got my UserControl nestled deep within one of my DLLs, and I don't believe pulling it out is the best design.  I'd like to leave it in there, but I can't seem to do this AND have the control added to the toolbox.

One option would be to move the code I need to install it to the toolbox into the control's assembly, but that would add a dependency to **Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Immutable.10.0.dll**.  The assembly is both used by someone with Visual Studio installed, and a remote server running within a service where VS isn't installed, so that's a no-go.

Another option I tried was to ""trick"" the toolbox installer VSIX by applying the RegistrationAttribute to *proxies* which would register the types defined in the other assembly.  Thought it would work, but weird stuff happened.

![all kinds of weirdness in the toolbox][1]

Instead of getting two controls, I get a bunch of Border controls (the standard WPF border) in oddly named tabs, some of which echo some of my namespaces.

I have a DataGrid which is used for display and user input, it's quite a tricky Grid as it is the main focus of the entire application.  I have some columns that are read-only and I have used a CellStyle Setter to set KeyboardNavigation.IsTabStop to False to keep user input focused on the important columns and that works fine.  I would like a couple of the read-only columns to be hyperlinks that show a tooltip and do not receive the focus, however I am struggling to write the XAML that will achieve all three requirements at the same time.

One of the columns is to indicate if the item on the row has any Notes.  I have used the following XAML to display a HasNotes property in the cell in a DataGridTemplateColumn and on the Tooltip show the actual notes, in the Notes property:

                <DataGridTemplateColumn x:Name=""NotesColumn"" Header=""Notes"">

                    </DataGridTemplateColumn.CellStyle>
                </DataGridTemplateColumn>

That works fine but I would like to make it a Hyperlink instead so the user can do something with the Notes when they click on the cell contents.

I have another column which is a DataGridHyperlinkColumn used to display a Unit of Measurement on a hyperlink and when clicked the user can change the unit.  (The reason I have done it like this, rather than a ComboBox for example, is because as much as I want the user to be able to change the unit I want to make the interface such that it is a very deliberate act to change the unit, not something that can be done accidentally).

                </DataGridHyperlinkColumn>

One problem with the XAML for the Hyperlink column is that the IsTabStop = False doesn't appear to work, when tabbing through the Grid my hyperlink column still receives the focus, unlike the other columns where I've used a setter to change IsTabStop.  If push comes to shove I could live with that but I'd rather not.

What I actually want from both those columns is an amalgamation of the two appearances/behaviours i.e. Columns where the data is displayed on a hyperlink, where TabStop = False and which display a tooltip of a different property when hovered over.

Can anyone help advise me how to get a column that achieves the following:

1. Hyperlink displaying one property
2. Tooltip displaying a different property
3. IsTabStop = False that actually works when used with a hyperlink

In the original application, I had intentionally modified the margins of certain elements so that their edges were not within the bounds of the window.

It was a simple fix, but unfortunately this technique is not working when my application is made into a UserControl.  If I set the width of my UserControl to the same width as the window in my original application, when I view this UserControl within a test application, the elements whose borders I wanted to hide are now fully visible.

It doesn't make sense to me why this would happen.  If I set the width of the UserControl to a certain WIDTH, then the width of the UserControl should be equal to WIDTH, right?  Well, as you can see below in Image 1, all the elements of the UserControl are fully visible, no matter what I set WIDTH to be.

Assume we're binding to the following object:

    public class HurrDurr
    {
      public string Hurr {get{return null;}}
      public string Durr {get{return null;}}
    }

Well, it would appear that if we used a **MultiBinding** against this the fallback value would be shown, right?

    <TextBlock>
        <TextBlock.Text>                                
            <MultiBinding StringFormat=""{}{0} to the {1}""
                            FallbackValue=""Not set!  It works as expected!)"">
                <Binding Path=""Hurr""/>
                <Binding Path=""Durr""/>
            </MultiBinding>
        </TextBlock.Text>
    </TextBlock>

However the result is, in fact, **"" to the ""**.
Even forcing the bindings to return `DependencyProperty.UnsetValue` doesn't work:

    <TextBlock xmnlns:base=""clr-namespace:System.Windows;assembly=WindowsBase"">
        <TextBlock.Text>                                
            <MultiBinding StringFormat=""{}{0} to the {1}""
                FallbackValue=""Not set!  It works as expected!)"">
                <Binding Path=""Hurr""
                    FallbackValue=""{x:Static base:DependencyProperty.UnsetValue}"" />
                <Binding Path=""Durr""
                    FallbackValue=""{x:Static base:DependencyProperty.UnsetValue}"" />
            </MultiBinding>
        </TextBlock.Text>
    </TextBlock>

Tried the same with **TargetNullValue**, which was also a bust all the way around.

So it appears that **MultiBinding** will never ever use **FallbackValue**.  Is this true, or am I missing something?

The problem i am having at the moment is the dropshadopeffect on the left hand side is covering (on top of) the left listboxitem. This is fine for me, however the dropshadoweffect on the right hand side of the listboxitem is covered by (below) the right listboxitem.

Is there a way to make them consistent? so that both sides' dropshadoweffect will appear on top of the left and right listboxitems.
