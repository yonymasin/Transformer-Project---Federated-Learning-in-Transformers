The log need contain unhandled exceptions and events that I raised manually when something happen.

Also I need to have the ability to serialize the log and maybe also save the log in some file excel?).

And last I need to write some events to windows event log.

What I thought to do is datagrid control in the view that binding to CollectionView in its view model, and I'll populate the collection when its needed

I can add searching, filtering and other capabilities and I can bind the row color to the severity of the row (error = red, warning = green etc.)

I'm sure it can be save to file and about the serialize I think there is a problem to serialize CollectionView but I hope it can be resolve.

I saw once that there a .net class to write to windows events log (i'm right?) so its not a problem.      
  
  
  
Its my first time that i write app with logging system and I saw a lot of people using some logging librarys but I dont understand why.

Any answer / explanation will help.  
Thanks!

The main concern I'm having is that I don't see much talk about MVVM frameworks and navigation (i.e., NavigationWindows and Frames).

My current app relies heavily on Pages to present views to the user.  I would prefer to keep it this way.  I'd rather not change everything to UserControls and rely on DataTemplates to switch out the view I need to present.

Are there any **MVVM frameworks** that:

(WPF / MVVM),"In a WPF / MVVM application, I am trying to find a code-efficient way to set the main view cursor to <code>Cursors.Wait</code> prior to any lengthy operation and to restore it to the default cursor after completion.

Since all operations are invoked using routed commands, I'd like to find a way of intercepting command execution, ideally by creating a generic command class that wraps an instance of a built-in routed command, but I can't visualize how to do this.

Specifically, the <code>RoutedCommand.Execute</code> method is not virtual so I need another mechanism to intercept its calls. Also, I am not sure how an instance of the generic command class would reference the view for which it has to set the cursor. 

Any advice please?

Thanks,

So the main editor window with OK and Cancel can be shared between several editors. I am designing the app in such a way that the editor user control will just bind the view model for the item which is edited. So when designing  the UI for editing individual items OK or Cancel Button is not pulled in, but simply put the item into the main editor which will provide the buttons.

Each call to a webservice instantiates a new proxy instance but the client is always closed when a response is received from the webservice.

Application also manipulates with bitmaps for a GIS and this is also done on a periodic interval.  No where in code am I  explicitly creating threads besides localized usage of the Timer class to poll for data periodically.  The GIS does 
use the BackgroundWorker but they do limit the thread count.

My program consists of a large graphing UI control that I need to spend about 15 seconds re-loading every once in a while.  Because the updating code works primarily with the UI control (maybe 90% of it actually sets properties on the control), it would make sense to me to actually let the UI thread handle that.  I really don't want the control to visually re-paint while it is loading in a separate thread from the UI.

I've used colors to see how the controls sizes. The `Grid` is gray and the `ItemsControl` is dark gray.

As you can see from the colors the containing `Grid` stretches while the `ItemsControl` does not. I did set its `HorizontalAlignment` property to `Stretch` but it seems it has no effect. Is there anything else I need do?

I've used colors to see how the controls sizes. The `Grid` is gray and the `ItemsControl` is dark gray.

This is the result ...

![This is the result][1]

As you can see from the colors the containing `Grid` stretches while the `ItemsControl` does not. I did set its `HorizontalAlignment` property to `Stretch` but it seems it has no effect. Is there anything else I need do?

Thanks

It is acting as a pop-up set to TopMost=true, and a call to the win32 SetWindowPos to TOPMOST. When first opened it appears on top of another running application on the desktop- maximized or not.

If the user activates or uses a window in the application mine loses focus and disappears. 

I thought of manipulating the other application window, setting it to a lower z index. How do I find the application window? How do I iterate through all windows? (This question still stands, even if it is not the correct approach).

I would be using SetWindowPos,  GetForegroundWindow, GetForegroundWindow, GetDesktopWindow  et cetera.

I suspect that as soon as the user clicks in their application that it will still focus it regardless and I am barking up the wrong tree. 

At the moment, my application is a black box and I can’t handle it the other way,  for example, periodically messaging my app to focus.

I also thought of having a long running background thread which periodically focuses my WPF popup, but need to watch resources and processor.

Kind regards,

I am trying to create a simple order app, it has order items, each order has lineitems.  There are two sections on the main page, (to start with they were both usercontrols). 

The top is bound to the list of orders.  The bottom is bound to the currently selected order, (the idea being it will display the detail of that order).

The details view needs to be able to view / edit and add new items.  To this end I thought I should have two views / templates, the edit order view and the new order view / template.  During my reading I came across datatemplates and thought this would be a good way to achieve this.

In my mainwindow.xaml I have the list of orders view bound as follows:

    <ContentControl Content=""{Binding Path=OrdersViewModel}""

The view is hooked up in the resources file with:

    <DataTemplate DataType=""{x:Type vm:AllOrdersViewModel}"">
        <vw:AllOrdersView />
    </DataTemplate>

This works great, when the app starts up they orders are displayed.  I did the same with the order detail to start with (i.e. it only had the datatype set rather than any key defined.  This worked well, if no order was selected then the view would not display, when an order was selected it would show up.

I am currently trying to change this to a template so that I can dynamically switch the template / view so that when they user clicked NEW order (the viewmodel has an Enum that states the current state of an order, so I would check against the enum value), the view should change.

If I try the following it will blow up.  The app starts, the list of orders is displayed (at this point no orders are selected), and the details view is displayed, then one of the converters will blow up due to dependencyproperty.unsetvalue, (side note, should I always check for that?).  Ideally I do not want the view to be shown until an order is selected:

Looking at my logs, the Change command is received, the new user control is instantiated, the constructor runs. The Main Content Property is set, the OnPropertyChanged event fires

and then nothing. The application hangs and windows says its not responding and closes the app.

The OnLoaded event of the user control never gets fired.

This happens on loading any user control this way on the specific machine.

Ideas, comments are all welcome. Idea how to debug this one are welcome.

1 Parent Control
  1.1 - USer Control 1 as Master Control
  1.2 - User Control 2 as Details Control
 
The Master Control has the List box where I select the name of the Item and the Details Control Displays the all the available Items in stock.
I have Added ItemId in the Parent Control and bound it to the Master Control and Details Control (both controls have ItemId as DP). 
When I select the Item from Master the details Grid is not refreshing.

How can I make sure that when I select the Item from Master User Control; the Detail User Control should show me the details?

Thanks,

Basically it is just a template for a button with a basic mouseover effect and the image for disabled state bound to Tag (seems an ugly solution).

I want to create a custom button which works pretty the same, but I want to expose two custom properties: NormalImage and DisabledImage. Those properties should be of type string not Uri. I want to use the path to image just ""apply.png"" and not ""pack://application:,,,/Resources/Apply.png"". 
I guess, to have such custom properties I need a UserControl with dependency properties?

Basically, I want to use the button as follows:

    <MyImageButton NormalImage=""apply.png"" DisabledImage=""apply_disabled.png""/>

Maybe NormalImage/DisabledImage will be bound to something later but that's unlikely.

I could not find any example which implements such a basic button with custom properties, there are only some fancy buttons and controls online. Maybe I am just using incorrect keywords...

(This is coming from a scientific grade camera, via a PCI frame-grabber).  I would like to do some simple processing on the video (clip dynamic range, colorize, add overlays) and then show it in a window, using C#.

I have this working using Windows Forms & GDI (for each frame, build a Bitmap object, write raw 32-bit RGB pixel values based on my post-processing steps, and then draw the frame using the Graphics class).  But this uses a significant chunk of CPU that I'd like to use for other things.  So I'm interested in using WPF for its GPU-accelerated video display.  (I'd also like to start using WPF for its data binding & layout features.)  

But I've never used WPF before, so I'm unsure how to approach this.  Most of what I find online about video & WPF involves reading a compressed video file from disk (e.g. WMV), or getting a stream from a consumer-grade camera using a driver layer that Windows already understands.  So it doesn't seem to apply here (but correct me if I'm wrong about this).

So, my questions:

 - Is there a straighforward, WPF-based way to play video from raw, uncompressed bytes in memory (even if just as 8-bit grayscale, or 24-bit RGB)?

 -  Will I need to build DirectShow filters (or other DirectShow/Media Foundation-ish things) to get the post-processing working on the GPU?  

Also, any general advice / suggestions for documentation, examples, blogs, etc that are appropriate to these tasks would be appreciated.  Thanks!

When the program runs I add two objects of type MyClass to a List<MyClass>, set the list to the ItemsSource property of the tab control and it all works perfectly: I get two tabs with ""My Name"" and ""Your Name"" as the headers, the description is shown in the correct place and the button turns the bold on or off correctly.

My question is this, how do I add a button OUTSIDE of the tab control which could call the MyControl.ToggleBold method of the MyControl object which is in the content template of the selected item:

But of course in my application I don't want this control to have tightly-coupled code-behind, but instead the user control will be a view called ""DataTypeWholeNumberView"" and it will have its own ViewModel called ""DataTypeWholeNumberViewModel"".

**So what is the relationship between:**

 1. binding the DataContext of UserControl XAML to its **code behind** which has a DependencyProperties

",wpf,mvvm,inotifypropertychanged,dependency-properties,,,open,0,575,8,"What is the relationship between INotifyPropertyChanged and DependencyProperty? I'm building a **simple UserControl example** with DependencyProperties so that the properties of the control can be changed in XAML (code below).

But of course in my application I don't want this control to have tightly-coupled code-behind, but instead the user control will be a view called ""DataTypeWholeNumberView"" and it will have its own ViewModel called ""DataTypeWholeNumberViewModel"".

So I am going to implement the DependencyProperty logic below into the ViewModel, but in ViewModels I usually inherit INotifyPropertyChanged which seems to give me the same functionality.

**So what is the relationship between:**

 1. binding the DataContext of UserControl XAML to its **code behind** which has a DependencyProperties
 2. binding the DataContext of UserControl XAML (View) to its **ViewModel** (which inherits from INotifyPropertyChanged) and has properties which implements INotifyPropertyChanged functionality?

I have subclassed ItemsControl and added an AlternativeContent dep. property of type FrameworkElement to it. Now I want to provide default style in Themes/Generic.xaml (I have added ThemeInfoAttribute to AsseblyInfo, and provided metadata in static costructor as said in this [excellent tutorial][1]). 

The style contains a ControlTemplate, and I need to use second ControlTemplate inside of ItemsControl template, where I add a ContentPresenter that should show the AlternativeContent.

Now, my problem is how do I tell the ContentPresenter that it should take it's content from the top-level EnhancedItemsControl? If I were inside style's ControlTemplate, I would use

     Content=""{Binding AlternativeContent, RelativeSource={RelativeSource TemplatedParent}}"" 

but as I am in ItemsControl's ControlTemplate inside style's ControlTemplate, this obviously doesn't work, I'd need to refer not to parent template, but to grandparent template, however, TemplateBinding doesn't have the AncestorLevel parameter.

I also tried

     Content=""{Binding AlternativeContent, RelativeSource={RelativeSource FindAncestor, AncestorType={x:Type WPFControls:EnhancedItemsControl}}}""

but that results in empty ContentPresenter as well. I cannot name the TemplatedParent (because it is outside the ControlTemplate), so I cannot refer to it by name. I cannot use TemplatedParent RelativeBinding, because that doesn't reach over two levels of controltemplates. And RelativeSource FindAncestor strangely doesn't work.

Any idea how to solve this? Thank you!

",wpf,itemscontrol,templatebinding,,,,open,0,1186,18,"WPF - styling a lookless control: How to access dependecy properties of control from second level of ControlTemplates? I am extending the ItemsControl (class EnhancedItemsControl : ItemsControl), because I want to add several dependecy properties to it - like AlternativeContent which will be displayed when there are no items in collection (think of 'enter a search terms and hit search' label in a itemscontrol for results of search).

I have subclassed ItemsControl and added an AlternativeContent dep. property of type FrameworkElement to it. Now I want to provide default style in Themes/Generic.xaml (I have added ThemeInfoAttribute to AsseblyInfo, and provided metadata in static costructor as said in this [excellent tutorial][1]). 

The style contains a ControlTemplate, and I need to use second ControlTemplate inside of ItemsControl template, where I add a ContentPresenter that should show the AlternativeContent.

Now, my problem is how do I tell the ContentPresenter that it should take it's content from the top-level EnhancedItemsControl? If I were inside style's ControlTemplate, I would use

     Content=""{Binding AlternativeContent, RelativeSource={RelativeSource TemplatedParent}}"" 

but as I am in ItemsControl's ControlTemplate inside style's ControlTemplate, this obviously doesn't work, I'd need to refer not to parent template, but to grandparent template, however, TemplateBinding doesn't have the AncestorLevel parameter.

I also tried

     Content=""{Binding AlternativeContent, RelativeSource={RelativeSource FindAncestor, AncestorType={x:Type WPFControls:EnhancedItemsControl}}}""

but that results in empty ContentPresenter as well. I cannot name the TemplatedParent (because it is outside the ControlTemplate), so I cannot refer to it by name. I cannot use TemplatedParent RelativeBinding, because that doesn't reach over two levels of controltemplates. And RelativeSource FindAncestor strangely doesn't work.

Any idea how to solve this? Thank you!

My lower level is a drop-shadow in this case.  Because I assumed the drop shadow would be attached to the main element (a Button), I created another visual element, a Border, which sits behind the Button and has the shadow attached.

I use code along the lines of what is below to do that, and it works well, except that when the array grows large (as in 200 x 200 or more) it becomes slow (20+ secs to populate). It looks like instantiating the buttons is fast, but adding to the grid is slow.

 - Have him reboot his machine

 - Have him run a test WPF app that only displays a button -> also crashes
