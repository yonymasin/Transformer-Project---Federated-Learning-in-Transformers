I have two Targets: **PRO** & **FREE**. They both:

- have different info.plist file (set in build settings)

![enter image description here][1]

- have different **bundle id**, different icons and different prefix headers

- have different schemes (autocreated)

![enter image description here][2]

**Problem:**

I can't debug FREE version, because it is always run PRO version. I follow steps:

1) Switch to FREE. Clean build. Run. It install FREE version, but failed to run it.

![enter image description here][3]
![enter image description here][4]

2) Switch to PRO. Clean build. Run. It install PRO version and run it OK.


3) Repeat step 1. Now there are no errors, but it run PRO version instead of FREE.
