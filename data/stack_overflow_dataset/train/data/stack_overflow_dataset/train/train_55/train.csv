These books are necessary an useful, but not enough.   I'm not an apps programmer, and expect to do a lot of ""other things"".

What I'd like to find is a book that really covers in depth XCode, all the project templates it provides, is up to date with 64-bit, Snow Leopard (or Lion, now).    It should explain everything about the Mac software world that an new arrival to Mac software development would need to know.    I'm looking for understanding that lets me know or figure out, not just be given answers, to questions like:  what really goes on under the hood when you add a new .m or .c file?

How to organize a large project with several apps, several DLLs and static libraries, and documentation?   Do I really need Obj-C to use company X's SDK?  

Sure, a lot of information is available at the Apple site and through Google, here on S.O., etc, but quite a lot is obsolete or wrong or incomplete.

How to get that contract? I have entered all the banking information. What to do then?

2) I want some of my screens to be available only in portrait orientation. For that I enter views' .m file and add this:

    -(BOOL)shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation:(UIInterfaceOrientation)interfaceOrientation {
     return(interfaceOrientation ==UIInterfaceOrientationPortrait);
    }

But that is not working. Please answer step-by-step for me to understand everything

3) I started using new Xcode 4.5 (beta versions) and were really disappointed wit new ""size inspector"". It is really uncomfortable and I don't know how to use it. Is it possible to make it look like in previous Xcode 4.3?

4) I create a master detailed application. But then I delete MainTableView and put a ViewController instead. So that I don't have UINavigationBar. I only have UINavigationItems. How to change their colors? Or put an image instead?

5) When I create tableViews inside UIViewControllers on the iOS 6.0 simulator everything looks perfect. But when I launch app on my iPhone with iOS 6.0 beta 3 installed I face some problems. First of all, there are less cells with text inside than in my NSArray. Furthermore, I use

    -(NSInteger)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView NumberOfRowsInSection: (NSInteger)section {
     return [NSArrayName count];
    }

to have exact number of rows in my tableView. In simulator everything is good, but on device- not working. And one of the most annoying - when I scroll my table up and down on my device, my table looses form! It starts looking like in screen-shot attached. But if I go to another screen and then come back - everything normalizes. And if I scroll one more time cells also loose their form.

6) I really want to make very special tableView. One that will have horizontally scrollable cells with buttons. For that I use the following structure:
**UIView
UITableView (inside UIView) 
UITableViewCell (inside UITableView)
UITableView (the horizontal table inside UITableViewCell)**

When working with TableViewController.m (second line) I have great problem in following code:

    tableViewCell.horizontalTableView.transform = rotateTable;
    tableViewCell.horizontalTableView.frame = CGRectMake(0, 0, tableViewCell.horizontalTableView.frame.size.width, tableViewCell.horizontalTableView.frame.size.height); 
    tableViewCell.contentArray = [arrays objectAtIndex:indexPath.section];
    tableViewCell.horizontalTableView.allowsSelection = YES;
    cell = tableViewCell;

xCode shows: property ""horizontalTableView"" and ""contentArray"" not found on object of type ""UITableViewCell"". That is enormous! Because both horizontalTableView and ContentArray are described in UITableViewCell.h/.m. I really don't understand if I did something wrong - what to do?

The second box doesn't want to behave, however, and persists in breaking the program (the debugger shows up, listing all manner of variables and memory addresses and stuff that's frankly quite beyond my comprehension).

For example: 
Lets assume you have subclassed UITableViewController and wish to implement the method 

    -tableView:numberOfRowsInSection:

So, you start to type:

    -tableView

and you get the following CodeSense completion list

![Screenshot of CodeSense completion popup for -tableView][1]

That's great, but there are *loads* of available suggestions and scrolling through this list seems to defeat the point of CodeSense.

How do you narrow this list down further?

Selecting the second option in the popup list shows the following:

![Screenshot of CodeSense completion popup when second option selected][2]

To me this implies that if you type:

    -tableView:n

you should get a completion list popup with only the methods that have that prefix. In fact all I get is 'No Completions'.

If instead I try to start typing the method signature verbatim:

    -tableView:(

I then get an irrelevant completion list (it just lists types).

The above is just an example, I seem to come across this a lot when implementing interface methods.

I'm relatively new to Xcode (coming from a Visual Studio background), but I can't seem to find any information about this aspect of CodeSense.

Does Codesense support this sort of filtering, or am I just not using it correctly? 

Thanks.

I'm encountering what appear to be several obvious bugs in the feature, and wondered whether anyone else is experiencing the same?

Here are a couple of the bugs I'm seeing:

 1. GUI components can only be dragged onto view controllers after double clicking the controller. However, double clicking the controller zooms in beyond the point of controller fitting the screen, making positioning the new component nigh on impossible. Zooming out loses the controller focus and prevents adjustment of the new component.
 2. Adding a new view controller to the Storyboard makes all controllers, including the new one, disappear from view. They can only be made to appear one-by-one by left clicking their View in the Storyboard components list on the left.

**UPDATE**

I actually solved this one before finishing writing the question (!) but thought I'd post for others.

It seems these bugs arise when you have the Storyboard open in two separate Xcode windows. I'd left clicked the storyboard once in my ""main"" Xcode window so it loaded there, then I double-clicked it to load in a new, separate window. With the original window open these bugs arise. However, as soon as one of the windows is closed, all issues disappear.",xcode,bugs,storyboard,,,10/10/2011 04:53:18,not constructive,1,210,14,"XCode 4.2 - Has anyone else found Storyboard on Lion to be very buggy?

 1. GUI components can only be dragged onto view controllers after double clicking the controller. However, double clicking the controller zooms in beyond the point of controller fitting the screen, making positioning the new component nigh on impossible. Zooming out loses the controller focus and prevents adjustment of the new component.
 2. Adding a new view controller to the Storyboard makes all controllers, including the new one, disappear from view. They can only be made to appear one-by-one by left clicking their View in the Storyboard components list on the left.

**UPDATE**

I actually solved this one before finishing writing the question (!) but thought I'd post for others.

It seems these bugs arise when you have the Storyboard open in two separate Xcode windows. I'd left clicked the storyboard once in my ""main"" Xcode window so it loaded there, then I double-clicked it to load in a new, separate window. With the original window open these bugs arise. However, as soon as one of the windows is closed, all issues disappear.",3

The answer posted at the following link is close and describes using two story boards:

Another solution is to create another view within the same view controller and hide/unhide.

The problems with these solutions is that in the former, data needs to be copied to the new controller and could cause state problems.  In the latter solution if I use two views I need to then create duplicate IBOutlets for every member in the view!

I wish I could simply do the following:

1. Create a storyboard which contains a portrait and a landscape view.
2. Set a single outlet for each property that each view can reference.
3. Rotate the view as needed.

I hope to solve this issue before I go down the wrong rabbit hole.

10421853,05/02/2012 21:16:03,1071871,11/29/2011 17:46:24,5,1,Using a delegate to communicate between a UIPopoverViewController and a MainViewController,"I am working on an iPad app that has a main view (In this case an MKMapView) with a PopoverView controller which contains a UITableViewController. The content in the UITableview contains a number of variable elements which I need for dropping annotation pins on the MapView. These variables change depending on which row is selected. My thought was to use a delegate to accomplish this but I am struggling to implement it. 

I have declared delegate in the showIncidentList method (see enclosed code).  My questions are, is this custom delegate appropriate for this desired outcome, and if so, what am i missing that will allow me to communicate the information in the delegate and call the plotCallLocations method on the main view with the updated information from the delegate.

",xcode,delegates,uipopovercontroller,,,,open,0,746,11,"Using a delegate to communicate between a UIPopoverViewController and a MainViewController I am working on an iPad app that has a main view (In this case an MKMapView) with a PopoverView controller which contains a UITableViewController. The content in the UITableview contains a number of variable elements which I need for dropping annotation pins on the MapView. These variables change depending on which row is selected. My thought was to use a delegate to accomplish this but I am struggling to implement it. 

I have declared delegate in the showIncidentList method (see enclosed code).  My questions are, is this custom delegate appropriate for this desired outcome, and if so, what am i missing that will allow me to communicate the information in the delegate and call the plotCallLocations method on the main view with the updated information from the delegate.

Simply put, I was creating a Cocos2D app using XCode 3.2.6 and SDK 4.2. I used two devices for testing: iPhone 3GS and iPhone 4, both at IOS 4.2, I believe. When testing on either device I was getting solid 60 FPS performance. 

The disaster first hit when I upgraded to XCode 4.2. With no trouble I was able to open my project directly into this new version and run it. Everything is the same except that I am now in XCode 4.2. To my shock and horror I found that I was now getting FPS in the 45 to 50 range, and it will drop into the 30's at times, none of which ever happened before. 

At this point I decided to upgrade to Lion, XCode 4.3, and SDK 5.1. Unfortunately, this changed nothing.

I then upgraded both phones to the latest IOS, and still the performance problem continued.

Finally, I upgraded to the latest version of Cocos2D, but to no avail.

I have tried a number of remedies that involved release versus debug modes, compiler settings, etc. Nothing helps. 

I found something that might be a hint, but I do not know enough about Open GL ES at this time for it to make a lot of sense. On another forum someone had complained about the very same problem and said that if they disabled Vertex Buffer Object (VBO) support, it resolved the problem. I found where this is enabled within Cocos2D, disabled it, and to my surprise I was back up to 60 FPS. The app does not perform as strong as it did when compiled under XCode 3.2.6, but it is much better with VBO support disabled under XCode 4.3. The problem with this is that disabling VBO support is not recommended as it is suppose to enhance performance when enabled.

Some of the testing I have done seems to point to graphics being the issue. When the app does drop into the 45 FPS range all I have is 12 to 20 sprites moving on the screen. If I remove these sprites and allow everything else to continue operating, I get back to 60 FPS, even with VBO enabled. When I was developing under XCode 3.2.6, I at times would have 100+ sprites moving along (both in view and out) and the the FPS remained at 60.

So in short (sorry, too late for that), does anyone have any idea how the exact same code would run great when compiled through XCode 3.2.6, but rather badly under XCode 4.3? I have tried many different compiler settings to no avail.  My guess is that there is some simple setting somewhere that perhaps defaults to a different value between XCode 3 and XCode 4.  

I'm desperate, so please pass on any ideas you may have.

XCode is not that bad, but it is lacking some basic stuff.

To trigger the discussion, here are some of the features that I miss most, who knows maybe someone from Apple will bump into this post and steal some Ideas :)

 1. **Source-level error-highlighting**. The write-compile-fix cycle feels like going back in time 15 years ago to my early C days. Many errors can be spotted without having to compile and Java IDEs have been doing it for years.
 2. **A decent debugger**. This is a bit unfair because IntelliJ's debugger is the best I've used so far, but XCode's debugger is at least 5 years behind and Apple has a few more developers than JetBrains...
 3. **Stronger re-factoring**. A no-brainer I guess. XCode has some renaming capabilities (which they call re-factoring), but they are very few.
 4. **Override method**. This one is really amazing. XCode doesn't have an ""override method"" command which lets you choose the method you want to override from a super class or protocol. You need to go to the documentation or header file and start copy-pasting.
 5. **Duplicate selected line(s)**. I've bumped into some posts that offer workarounds for this via custom key-binding, but none of them works, at least for me.
 6. **Go to last edit point**. Bummer! Come on Apple, this one is so easy to implement and  so useful!
 7. **A better open quickly feature**. IntelliJ's quick find of classes/files/text is so much better...

Turns out that my list goes on and on, so I'll stop here...

When i am on the first Page (cover.m/.h) i want to switch to the next Page (Vorwort.m/.h) for that i´d like to access the method ""goToNextVorwort"" in the UIViewController. I did all programmatically. Here my code:

MyViewController:

    - (void)goToNextVorwort {
      vorwort = [[[Vorwort alloc] init] autorelease];
      vorwort.view.frame = CGRectMake(0, 1025, 768, 1024);

      [UIView setAnimationDelegate:self];
      [UIView setAnimationDidStopSelector:@selector(animationDidStop:finished:context:)];
      vorwort.view.frame = CGRectMake(0, 0, 768, 1024);
      [UIView commitAnimations];
}

    - (void)addButtonNext {
      UISwipeGestureRecognizer *swipeGesture = [[[UISwipeGestureRecognizer alloc]   initWithTarget:self action:@selector(buttonClick)] autorelease];
      swipeGesture.numberOfTouchesRequired = 1;
      swipeGesture.direction = (UISwipeGestureRecognizerDirectionLeft);
      [self.view addGestureRecognizer:swipeGesture];

    - (void)buttonClick {    
      //here i don't know what to write (i tried a lot of things)
    }

    - (void)loadView
    {
      self.view = [[[UIView alloc] initWithFrame:[[UIScreen mainScreen] applicationFrame]] autorelease];
   
      UIImage *umschlag = [UIImage imageNamed:@""Umschlag.png""];
      image = [[UIImageView alloc] initWithImage:umschlag];

      [self.view addSubview:image];
      [image release];    
      [self addButtonNext];  
    }


Some hours ago i was reading about uigesturerecognizerdelegate, could there be the solution or is there a    simple way to access goToNextVorwort. When i was running it in Simulator (in previous tries) i got Bad Access or something like this. Sorry, i am a n00b with a bad english. a little help would be awesome. regard Planky",3
