So far what I used to do is: run a program that writes a large file between consecutive runs of the read benchmark. Something like

    ./read_benchmark
    ./write --size 64G --path /tmp/test.out
    ./read_benchmark

The write program simply writes an array of size 1G 64 times to file. Since the size of the main memory is 64G, I write a file that is approx. the same size. The problem is that writing takes a long time and I was wondering if there are better ways to do this, i.e. avoid effects seen when data is cached. 

Also, what happens if I write data to /dev/null? 

    ./write --size 64G --path /dev/null

This way, the write program exits very fast, no I/O is actually performed, but I am not sure if it overwrites 64G of main memory, which is what I ultimately want.

I will try to be as precise as possible. Even then I am sorry if my question still ends up sounding vague because I have just started C and am not exactly sure how to explain myself better. So here goes,

1.) I assigned the values to elements as follows:
Ry=0/Rr=1/Cy=2/Cr=3 

2.) I then used time.h and the srand function along with two for loops to randomly fill an array with values from 0-3 and used if statements to print out the board as shown below.   
the result is something like this:

....1....2....3
 
1  Ry Rr Cy

2  Cy Rr Ry

3  Rr Cr Rr

In this game the objective is to get to all position of the board. A user may move from one element of the array ARRAY[1][1] to ARRAY[1][2] because the shape component (R) of the array is the same. The user may also move from ARRAY[1][1] to ARRAY[2][1] since the colour component (y) is the same. However since the board is randomly generated, there might not be a solution to the board(all possible paths that could lead the user to getting from one place on the board to every place.

I am having a very hard time finding a way to check if there is a solution to the board. Someone even suggested that I use 8 'for' loops and i just don't know how that is possible. This is all I myself know about this game and I have been trying to logically put things into place. So I have four questions and I will try to be as clear as possible.

1.) As i move from one position of the element to the other, is there a way to display an asterisk on the board to indicate my current position?

2.) How should I try to check if there is a solution to the board? Below is a link to the actual game:

http://www.clickmazes.com/chain/ixchain.htm

This should be even more helpful then my words to help get a picture of the actual game.

I am not a C programmer by trade (perl is my game) but i am trying to call a C library from perl. I have all the other required functions wrapped (SWIG). This is the last troublesome one.
Please dont shoot me down for my (lack of) C skills. I am trying and google only helps if you know exactly what to type!

i understand that ""const GLchar **"" means that it wants a pointer to an array of strings (GLchar arrays).
with no way of creating that directly i have to create a GLchar array first:

        GLbyte *GLbyte_array(int size) {
          return (GLbyte *) malloc(sizeof(GLbyte)*size);
        }

so i use that in perl via:

        my $var=GLbyte_array(20);

and then populate that one char at a time from perl by calling:

       void GLbyte_put(GLbyte *a, int i, char val) {
         a[i] = val;
       }

again, perl:

        my $str=""hello"";
        for(my $i; $i<length($str); $i++)
        { GLbyte_put($var, $i); }

all good. (well, perhaps not good - but it works).
i have a C char array containing the word ""hello"".

my solution then was to attempt to build an array of these guys and drop the array i created above into it. then return my required pointer to it:

dch",c,swig,,,,,open,0,366,9,"C array of strings referenced by const GLchar ** i have a C function that requires to be called with a ""const GLchar **"" parameter.

I am not a C programmer by trade (perl is my game) but i am trying to call a C library from perl. I have all the other required functions wrapped (SWIG). This is the last troublesome one.
Please dont shoot me down for my (lack of) C skills. I am trying and google only helps if you know exactly what to type!

i understand that ""const GLchar **"" means that it wants a pointer to an array of strings (GLchar arrays).
with no way of creating that directly i have to create a GLchar array first:

        GLbyte *GLbyte_array(int size) {
          return (GLbyte *) malloc(sizeof(GLbyte)*size);
        }

so i use that in perl via:

        my $var=GLbyte_array(20);

and then populate that one char at a time from perl by calling:

       void GLbyte_put(GLbyte *a, int i, char val) {
         a[i] = val;
       }

again, perl:

        my $str=""hello"";
        for(my $i; $i<length($str); $i++)
        { GLbyte_put($var, $i); }

all good. (well, perhaps not good - but it works).
i have a C char array containing the word ""hello"".

my solution then was to attempt to build an array of these guys and drop the array i created above into it. then return my required pointer to it:

        const GLchar **get_GLbyte_array_ptr(GLbyte *a) {
	     char *arr[1];
	     arr[0]= a;
	     return (const GLchar**)arr[0];
       }

perl:

        my $ptr=get_GLbyte_array_ptr($var);

this is clearly a load of tosh. it compiles and then segfaults.

When I type ""make makefile"" into the command line the compiler says ""make: Nothing to be done for `makefile'"". I'm guessing I got the format wrong.

Also, is there an extension for makefiles (makefile.txt, makefile.c)?

And do makefiles have to be named makefile? Could I name it taliasmakefile or makefile69 or lykeim2freespirited4skool or iwanaBahippie?

I have know of a way to do it by using `fscanf()`:

		for (int i=0;i<4;i++)
		{
		fscanf(pFile, ""%lld"", &junk);
		fscanf(pFile, ""%f"", &buffer[i]);
		fscanf(pFile, ""%f"", &junk);
		fscanf(pFile, ""%f"", &junk);
		}


However, since I'm doing parallel programing which requires me to use different Windows Threads to read different columns, so I'll need to read the elements in the 2nd column directly using `fseek()`.

The question here is, what should I put in the 2nd argument in `fseek()` in the code below to move my file pointer to read the 2nd element of the 2nd line? 

                
		fscanf(pFile, ""%llf"", &junk);//<------this is used to skip the 1st data
		
		for (int i=0;i<4;i++)
		{
                fscanf(pFile, ""%f"", &buffer[i]);
                fseek ( pFile , ??, SEEK_CUR );//<----how do I calculate this offset?

Here are a few that come to mind:

- The Linux UDP `select` bug: `select` (and related interfaces) flag a UDP socket file descriptor ready for reading as soon as a packet has been received, without confirming the checksum. On subsequent `recv`/`read`/etc., if the checksum was invalid, the call will block. Working around this requires always setting UDP sockets to non-blocking mode and dealing with the `EWOULDBLOCK` condition. If I remember correctly, MaraDNS was the first notable project affected by this bug and the first to complain (unsuccessfully) to have it fixed.
- The `printf` family in the GNU C library wrongly treats arguments to `%s` as multibyte character strings instead of byte strings when a field precision (as in `%.3s`) is specified, potentially causing truncated output. I know of no workaround except replacing the whole `printf` subsystem.
- Wrong `errno` result codes for certain syscalls (can't remember which ones right off). Usually these are easy enough to check for if you just read the GNU/Linux man pages and compare them to the standard.

What are some more bugs and workarounds we can add to this list?

The context of this code is not hugely important. The problem is that let's say fgets takes in ""ls"", ""date"", and ""history"". The resulting output is:

    1  ls
	2  	3  te
	4  	5  ory
	6 

It should be: 

    1  ls
    2  date
    3  history",1

The Unix compilers (various versions of GCC, and the compilers on AIX and HP-UX) were all quite happy with the `enum`.  MSVC 2005 objected with error `C2056: Illegal Expression`.  According to [MSDN][1], this is because 'An expression was invalid because of a previous error'.  This was the only error reported, which makes it slightly surprising.

However, my questions are:

1. Is MSVC 2005 accurately interpreting the C89 standard in disallowing the `enum`?
2. Are the Unix compilers being too generous in permitting this without warning?
3. Does C99 (or C2011) make any difference?
4. Do more recent versions of MSVC still object to the `enum`?

FWIW: the acceptable solution was to change the `enum` into:

    static int const ARRAY_SIZE = sizeof(array) / sizeof(array[0]);

One day, I'll work out why the other builds on Windows seem to be accepting the `enum`; I fear that I'll find this particular sub-product is out of line with everything else.)

",c,pipe,,,,05/18/2012 15:06:52,too localized,1,927,8,"problems with implementing pipelines in a C shell I'm trying for 3 days to implement pipelines in shell.
for some reason i can't run the left expression.
if for instance i try to run ""ls|grep r"",for some reason it won't run me the ls.
I'm pretty sure that the bug should be in the pipeline implementation b/c i tried the other

Memcpy should crack when unavailable memory is being accesed or the source and destination memory blocks overlap, so as far as I'm concerned, none of these problems seem to be valid.

`entab` replaces a number of spaces with a tab character and `detab` does the opposite. The question I have concerns the tab stops and `entab`. I figure that for `detab` it's pretty easy to determine the number of spaces needed to reach the next tab stop, so no worries there. With `entab`, replacing spaces with tabs is slightly more difficult since I cannot for sure know how large the tab character goes to its own tab stop (unless there is a way to know for sure).

`entab` replaces a number of spaces with a tab character and `detab` does the opposite. The question I have concerns the tab stops and `entab`. I figure that for `detab` it's pretty easy to determine the number of spaces needed to reach the next tab stop, so no worries there. With `entab`, replacing spaces with tabs is slightly more difficult since I cannot for sure know how large the tab character goes to its own tab stop (unless there is a way to know for sure).

Am I even thinking about this thing properly?",3

To run, create a file named '1.qad' with the content 'Q00Q11111'.

I have a struct called QuadImageInfo, that has a float and four pointers to QuadImageInfo (these pointers are defined by QuadImage).

My main objective is to be able to access/modify the four QuadImages referenced inside a QuadImageInfo, without repeating the same code 4 times. That is, creating an array that will contain the 4 pointers of QuadImageInfo.

In LoadQuadImage, I create a QuadImage called 'loaded' and I pass it as an argument to LoadQuadImageAux. There, I call SetPointersToQuadrants, that returns an array/pointer to the 4 pointers of the given QuadImage(Info). In the 'for' loop, I want that a given pointer, points to a new QuadImage.

These modification must modify 'loaded', that is returned at the end of LoadQuadImage.

The program must then print 'Q00Q11111'<---- not happening :(

I hope I wrote it clear. :b

Hi. I'm trying to understand processes and forks. 

I'm not sure how many processes does this code snippet create.

1 for the main program, then the main program duplicates itself (a child process is created), and then the child duplicates itself (2 children and the main process).

So those are 3 processes.

The basic structure I have now is to memcpy chunks of the data into a local array on each processor, operate on those, and Allgatherv (have to use ""v"" because the size of local blocks isn't strictly identical).

In C this would look something like:

    /* counts gives the parallelization, counts[RANK] is the local memory size */
    /* offsets gives the index in the global array to the local processors */

    memcpy (&local_memory[0], &total_vector[0], counts[RANK] * sizeof (double));
    for (i = 0; i < counts[RANK]; i++)

    MPI_Allgatherv (&local_memory[0], counts[RANK], MPI_DOUBLE, &total_vector[0], counts, offsets, MPI_DOUBLE, MPI_COMM_WORLD);

As it turns out, this isn't very efficient. In fact, it's really freaking slow, so bad that for most system sizes I'm interested in the parallelization doesn't lead to any increase in speed.

I suppose an alternative to this would be to update just the local chunks of the global vector on each processor and then have a loop over the number of processes which broadcasts the correct chunk of memory from the correct tasks to all other tasks. While this avoids the explicit memory handling, a broadcast loop will almost without question be even worse than my current situation.

Anyone have a better solution?

I can see with a sniffer that once I start the program the NIC (eth4) start receiving the multicast datagrams, However, I can't recieve() any in my program.  
Searched the web for some examples/explanations, but it seems like I do what everybody else does.

For instance, one might declare a variable using `int_fast16_t`, but it would actually be implemented as an `int32_t` on a 32 bit processor, or `int64_t` on a 64 bit processor as those would be the fastest types of at least 16 bits on those platforms.

I have a user application that needs to determine if a particular process is running.  Here's what I know about the process:

- The name
- The user (`root`)
- It *should* already be running, since it's a LaunchDaemon, which means
- Its parent process should be `launchd` (pid 1)

I've tried several ways to get this, but none have worked so far.  Here's what I've tried:

1.  Running `ps` and parsing the output.  This works, but it's slow (`fork`/`exec` is expensive), and I'd like this to be as fast as possible.

2.  Using the `GetBSDProcessList` function [listed here][qa1123].  This also works, but the way in which they say to retrieve the process name (accessing `kp_proc.p_comm` from each `kinfo_proc` structure) is flawed.  The resulting `char*` only contains the first 16 characters of the process name, which can be seen in the definition of the `kp_proc` structure:

    <pre>#define MAXCOMLEN 16 //defined in param.h
    struct extern_proc {  //defined in proc.h
      ...snip...
      char p_comm[MAXCOMLEN+1];
      ...snip...
    };</pre>

3.  Using [libProc.h][libproc] to retrieve process information:

    <pre>pid_t pids[1024];
    int numberOfProcesses = proc_listpids(PROC_ALL_PIDS, 0, NULL, 0);	
    proc_listpids(PROC_ALL_PIDS, 0, pids, sizeof(pids));	
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; numberOfProcesses; ++i) {
      if (pids[i] == 0) { continue; }
      char name[1024];
      proc_name(pids[i], name, sizeof(name));
      printf(""Found process: %s\n"", name);
    }</pre>

    This works, except it has the same flaw as `GetBSDProcessList`.  Only the first portion of the process name is returned.

4.  Using the [ProcessManager function][pm] in Carbon:

    <pre>ProcessSerialNumber psn;
    psn.lowLongOfPSN = kNoProcess;
    psn.highLongOfPSN = 0;
    while (GetNextProcess(&psn) == noErr) {
      CFStringRef procName = NULL;
      if (CopyProcessName(&psn, &procName) == noErr) {
        NSLog(@""Found process: %@"", (NSString *)procName);
      }
      CFRelease(procName);
    }</pre>

    This does not work.  It only returns process that are registered with the WindowServer (or something like that).  In other words, it only returns apps with UIs, and only for the current user.

5.  I can't use [`-[NSWorkspace launchedApplications]`][nsws], since this must be 10.5-compatible.

I know that it's *possible* to retrieve the name of running processes (since `ps` can do it), but the question is ""Can I do it without forking and exec'ing `ps`?"".

Any suggestions?

        p2->next = NULL;

        while (p2->prev != NULL){
            p2 = p2->prev;
        }

        return p2;
    }


Here is code 2:
    struct node* dup(struct node* head) {
        if ( head == NULL ) {
            return NULL;
        }

        /*set up the head node of the new list first*/
        struct node* h2 = (struct node*) malloc(sizeof(struct node));
        int len = sizeof(head->str) + 1;
        h2->str = (char*) malloc(len);
        strcpy(h2->str, head->str);
        h2->prev = NULL;

        struct node* pp = h2;
        struct node* p = head->next;
        struct node* p2 = NULL;
        while ( p != NULL ) {
            p2 = (struct node*) malloc(sizeof(struct node));
            len = sizeof(p->str) + 1;
            p2->str = (char*) malloc(sizeof(len));
            strcpy(p2->str, p->str);
            p2->prev = pp;
            pp->next = p2;
            pp = p2;
            p = p->next;
        }
        p2->next = NULL;

        return h2;
    }


The main difference is code2 specifically takes care of the head node of the new list, the purpose is to make the while loop easier to program.

Again the question is, if everything else equals, which interviewee will you pick?

When running with valgrind memcheck the segfault disappears and the program completes normally without any warnings from valgrind.

Note how according to gdb the __bamc_put is passed a NULL pointer as the key parameter. This seems like the obvious culprit for causing the segfault. But here's the thing, the second parameter for DB->put is actually supposed to be the the transaction or NULL for a non-transaction insert.

Here's my code:

    DBT bdb_key, bdb_data;
    
    memset(&bdb_key, 0, sizeof(DBT));
    memset(&bdb_data, 0, sizeof(DBT));
    bdb_key.data = hash.d8;
    bdb_key.size = 32;
    bdb_data.data = (char *) &data;
    bdb_data.size = 8;

    result = hnd->bdb_inv->put(hnd->bdb_inv, NULL, &bdb_key, &bdb_data, 0);

From: https://github.com/justmoon/bzing/blob/master/src/bzing.c

This is the signature as it appears in the documentation and in all examples that I've found.

    DB->put(DB *db, DB_TXN *txnid, DBT *key, DBT *data, u_int32_t flags);

See http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E17076_02/html/api_reference/C/dbput.html

If I try to use the signature that gdb indicates (omitting the DB_TXN parameter) I just get compiler warnings as the compiler uses the correct signature as per the documentation.

So I thought maybe I'm linking against the wrong library? But:

When running with valgrind memcheck the segfault disappears and the program completes normally without any warnings from valgrind.

Note how according to gdb the __bamc_put is passed a NULL pointer as the key parameter. This seems like the obvious culprit for causing the segfault. But here's the thing, the second parameter for DB->put is actually supposed to be the the transaction or NULL for a non-transaction insert.

Here's my code:

    DBT bdb_key, bdb_data;
    
    memset(&bdb_key, 0, sizeof(DBT));
    memset(&bdb_data, 0, sizeof(DBT));
    bdb_key.data = hash.d8;
    bdb_key.size = 32;
    bdb_data.data = (char *) &data;
    bdb_data.size = 8;

    result = hnd->bdb_inv->put(hnd->bdb_inv, NULL, &bdb_key, &bdb_data, 0);

From: https://github.com/justmoon/bzing/blob/master/src/bzing.c

This is the signature as it appears in the documentation and in all examples that I've found.

    DB->put(DB *db, DB_TXN *txnid, DBT *key, DBT *data, u_int32_t flags);

See http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E17076_02/html/api_reference/C/dbput.html

If I try to use the signature that gdb indicates (omitting the DB_TXN parameter) I just get compiler warnings as the compiler uses the correct signature as per the documentation.

So I thought maybe I'm linking against the wrong library? But:

    $ ldd build/test/bzing_test | grep libdb

  But the thing is that , before i advance myself to it , i still have a few question that need any expert's help on previous stuff.Actually it's about datatype.

<b>A.)Character Type</b>

1.) I extract the following italize sentences from the book C primer Plus 5th ed.

<i>Somewhat oddly , C treats character constans as type `int` rather than `char`.For example on an ASCII system with a 32-bit `int and an 8-bit `char` , the code

    char grade = 'B';

represent 'B' as the numerical value 66 stored in a 32-bit unit , `grade` winds up with 66 stored ub ab 8-bit unit.This characteristic of character constants makes it possible to define a character constant such as `'FATE'` , with four separate 8-bit ASCII codes stored in a 32-bit unit.However , attempting to assign such a character constant to a `char` variable results in only the last 8 bits being used , so the variable gets the value 'E'.</i>


<br />

2.) So the next thing i did after reading this was of course , follow what it mentions , that is i try store the word `FATE` on a variable with char type name `grade` and try to compile and see what it'll be stored using `printf()` , but instead of getting the character `'E'` printed out , what I get is `'F'`.

3.)Does this mean there's some mistake in the book??OR there's someting i misunderstood??

4.)From the above sentences , there's a line says C treats character constants as type `int`.So to try it out , i assign a number bigger than 255 , let's say 356 to the `char` type.

5.)Since 356 is within the range of 32-bit `int`(i'm running windows 7) , therefore i expect it would print out 356 when i use `%d` specifier.

6.)But instead of printing 356 , it gives me 100 , which is the last 8-bits value.

7.)Why this happen??I thought `char` == `int` == 32-bits??(**Although it does mention before char is only a byte).
<br />
<br />
<br />

<b>B.)Int and Floating Type</b>

1.)I understand when a number stores in variable in `short` type is pass to variadic function or any implicit prototype function ,it'll be automatically promoted to `int` type.

2.)This also happen to floating point type , when a floating-point number with `float` type is passed , it'll be converted to `double` type , that is why there's no specifier for the `float` type but instead there's only `%f` for `double and `%Lf` for long double.

3.)But why there's a specifier for `short` type although it is also promoted but not `float` type??Why don't they just give a specifier for `float` type with a modifier like `%hf` or something??Is there anything logical or technical behind this??

And then prints the size of x in percentiles in relation to the numbers r0,r1,r2,...,rn

        #include<stdio.h>
    
    
    int main(){
    
    int n, i=0;
    double r[1000], x;
    
    printf(""Enter how many numbers\n"");
    scanf(""%i"", &n);
        
    printf(""Enter numbers\n"");
    while(i<n){
        scanf(""%lf"", &r[i]);
        i++;
        }
    
    printf(""Enter x:\n"");
    scanf(""%lf"", &x);
   // need part here
   // where percentiles are calculated

    }




So here is my problem, how the hell i can calculate that percentiles?
I've read a lot of about percentiles and still I don't understand that, so maybe someone will explain it to me what i need to do, or just show me a pattern how to calculate that percentiles.
I know C language a bit so i can write alone if some1 explain it to me how i can calculate percentiles ;o

P.S. about percentiles from wikipedia 

> In statistics, a percentile (or centile) is the value of a variable below which
 a certain percent of observations fall. For example, the 20th percentile is the value (or score) below 
which 20 percent of the observations may be found.
The 25th percentile is also known as the first quartile (Q1), the 50th percentile as the median or second quartile (Q2), and the 75th percentile as the third quartile (Q3).",1

I read [this code][1] which is an implementation of `matrix multiplication` using `MPI` and would like to change a bit for general use:read data from an input file(e.g. input.txt) whose content is like this:

    3 3
    1 0 0
    0 1 0
    0 0 1
    
    3 3
    2 3 4
    2 1 4
    3 2 5

which represents Matrix A and B with their **rows,columns,data** respectively.And I hope the result to be print to some text file like `output.txt`.So the code is run like:

    mpirun -np 4 mpi_exec_file input.txt output.txt

The problem is that the size has to be allocated dynamically. I used `one dimensional` array to simulate the matrix.</p>
I first tried to allocate space for `A,B,C` in the `master processor`(taskid==0) however the other worker processor cannot recognize the allocated space and complains that the buffer size is `0`. <i>**Can MPI_bcast solve this problem?**</i> </p>
Then I allocated the space just below `MPI_init`,now the workers recognize it but always treat value of array C to be `0`. ***What's wrong?***</p>

""You will be given a matrix A of size M N which shows who read which book in the book club.
Each row corresponds to a book club member and each column corresponds to a specic book in
the library. The cell at the ith row and the jth column of the matrix is 1 if the person indexed
by i has read the book indexed by j, and it is 0 otherwise.
The coordinator of the book club decided to use an algorithm to nd the group of members
and subset of books. The problem is to nd the largest submatrix whose entries are all 1. The
order of the rows and the order of the columns have no specic meaning and can be rearranged
when nding this submatrix. The coordinator decides to use an algorithm which is ecient and
easy to implement but does not guarantee to nd the largest submatrix.
The algorithm is as follows:
1. If the matrix A contains all 1s, report A as the result and end the algorithm
2. Else nd a row R in A which contains the maximum number of 1s such that the number
of 1s is less than N. In case of equality choose the row with the smaller row label (See
below for a description of the row/column labels). Let the number of 1s in row R be k,
0 < k < N.
3. Put row R as the rst row and arrange the columns of A so that the rst k columns are 1
in the rst row and the rest of the columns are 0
4. Arrange the rest of the rows as follows in the following order:
(a) Put the rows which contain all 0 in the last N 􀀀 k columns, rst. Let the number of
such rows be p.
(b) Put the rows which contain at least one 1 in the rst k columns and at least one 1 in
the last N 􀀀 k columns, next. Let the number of such rows be q.
(c) Finally, put the rows which contain all 0s in the rst k columns, as the last set of
rows. Let the number of such rows be r.
5. Dene two submatrices U and V as follows:
(a) U is the submatrix dened by the rst 1 + p + q rows and the rst k columns.
(b) V is the submatrix dened by the last q + r rows and all the N columns.
Note that U and V overlaps.
6. Count the number of 1s in U and V . If U contains more 1s than V then set A = U and go
to Step 1, else set A = V and go to Step 1. Set M and N accordingly in the new A.""

time_t      tv_sec;     /* seconds */  
suseconds_t tv_usec;    /* microseconds */  

My question is as follows:  
Is the tv_usec field is the WHOLE TIME passed since the EPOCH in microseconds, or is it just the remain of the time in microseconds?  

For example, if the time passed is 100 seconds and 25 microseconds, will the tv_usec field have the value '25' or the value '100000025'?

share [g+] share [fb] share [tw]
	

I have almost solved this quadrant queries problem of interviewstreet using segment trees with lazy propogation but still getting wrong answer so need help in my code.

This is the question :

Quadrant Queries (30 points)

There are N points in the plane. The ith point has coordinates (xi, yi). Perform the following queries:

1) Reflect all points between point i and j both including along the X axis. This query is represented as ""X i j""
2) Reflect all points between point i and j both including along the Y axis. This query is represented as ""Y i j""
3) Count how many points between point i and j both including lie in each of the 4 quadrants. This query is represented as ""C i j""

Input:
The first line contains N, the number of points. N lines follow.
The ith line contains xi and yi separated by a space.
The next line contains Q the number of queries. The next Q lines contain one query each, of one of the above forms.
All indices are 1 indexed.

Output:
Output one line for each query of the type ""C i j"". The corresponding line contains 4 integers; the number of points having indices in the range [i..j] in the 1st,2nd,3rd and 4th quadrants respectively.

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 100000
1 <= Q <= 100000
You may assume that no point lies on the X or the Y axis.
All (xi,yi) will fit in a 32-bit signed integer
In all queries, 1 <=i <=j <=N

Sample Input:
4
1 1
-1 1
-1 -1
1 -1
5
C 1 4
X 2 4
C 3 4
Y 1 2
C 1 3
Sample Output:
1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0
0 2 0 1

Explanation:
When a query says ""X i j"", it means that take all the points between indices i and j both including and reflect those points along the X axis. The i and j here have nothing to do with the co-ordinates of the points. They are the indices. i refers to point i and j refers to point j

'C 1 4' asks you to 'Consider the set of points having index in {1,2,3,4}. Amongst those points, how many of them lie in the 1st,2nd,3rd and 4th quads respectively?' The answer to this is clearly 1 1 1 1.

Next we reflect the points between indices '2 4' along the X axis. So the new coordinates are :
1 1
-1 -1
-1 1
1 1

Now 'C 3 4' is 'Consider the set of points having index in {3,4}. Amongst those points, how many of them lie in the 1st,2nd,3rd and 4th quads respectively?' Point 3 lies in quadrant 2 and point 4 lies in quadrant 1. So the answer is 1 1 0 0

I have almost solved this quadrant queries problem of interviewstreet using segment trees with lazy propogation but still getting wrong answer so need help in my code.

This is the question :

Quadrant Queries (30 points)

There are N points in the plane. The ith point has coordinates (xi, yi). Perform the following queries:

1) Reflect all points between point i and j both including along the X axis. This query is represented as ""X i j""
2) Reflect all points between point i and j both including along the Y axis. This query is represented as ""Y i j""
3) Count how many points between point i and j both including lie in each of the 4 quadrants. This query is represented as ""C i j""

Input:
The first line contains N, the number of points. N lines follow.
The ith line contains xi and yi separated by a space.
The next line contains Q the number of queries. The next Q lines contain one query each, of one of the above forms.
All indices are 1 indexed.

Output:
Output one line for each query of the type ""C i j"". The corresponding line contains 4 integers; the number of points having indices in the range [i..j] in the 1st,2nd,3rd and 4th quadrants respectively.

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 100000
1 <= Q <= 100000
You may assume that no point lies on the X or the Y axis.
All (xi,yi) will fit in a 32-bit signed integer
In all queries, 1 <=i <=j <=N

Sample Input:
4
1 1
-1 1
-1 -1
1 -1
5
C 1 4
X 2 4
C 3 4
Y 1 2
C 1 3
Sample Output:
1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0
0 2 0 1

Explanation:
When a query says ""X i j"", it means that take all the points between indices i and j both including and reflect those points along the X axis. The i and j here have nothing to do with the co-ordinates of the points. They are the indices. i refers to point i and j refers to point j

'C 1 4' asks you to 'Consider the set of points having index in {1,2,3,4}. Amongst those points, how many of them lie in the 1st,2nd,3rd and 4th quads respectively?' The answer to this is clearly 1 1 1 1.

Next we reflect the points between indices '2 4' along the X axis. So the new coordinates are :
1 1
-1 -1
-1 1
1 1

Now 'C 3 4' is 'Consider the set of points having index in {3,4}. Amongst those points, how many of them lie in the 1st,2nd,3rd and 4th quads respectively?' Point 3 lies in quadrant 2 and point 4 lies in quadrant 1. So the answer is 1 1 0 0

",c,gimp,,,,,open,0,1702,5,"How to use gimp_drawable_set_pixel() ? I could like to set a pixel in GIMP, but I can't figure out how to specify the pixel value.

According to the [GIMP plugin API][1] it says:

    gboolean            gimp_drawable_set_pixel             (gint32 drawable_ID,
                                                             gint x_coord,
                                                             gint y_coord,
                                                             gint num_channels,
                                                             const guint8 *pixel);

If I e.g. do:

      const guint8 *pixel;
      pixel = (guint8 *) 0;
      gboolean s;
      s = gimp_drawable_set_pixel (layer, 5, 5, 3, pixel);
      printf (""Was the pixel set?: %i"", s);

The pixel is not set, and s is zero.

Can anyone figure this one out?

Lots of love,
Louise

    if (timeout > jiffies)

        /* we did not time out, good ... */
    }

        /* we timed out, error ...*
    }

This code works fine when jiffies value do not overflow.
However, when jiffies overflow and wrap around to zero, this code doesn't work properly.

Linux apparently provides macros for dealing with this overflow problem

    #define time_before(unknown, known) ((long)(unkown) - (long)(known) < 0)

and code above is supposed to be safe against overflow when replaced with this macro:

    // SAFE AGAINST OVERFLOW
    if (time_before(jiffies, timeout)
    {
        /* we did not time out, good ... */
    }
    else
    {
        /* we timed out, error ...*
    }    

However, I ran through some test cases, and it doesn't work correctly.

If I do:

    unsigned long jiffies = 2147483658;
    unsigned long timeout = 10;
    printf(""%d"",time_before(jiffies,timeout)); // jiffies > timeout, so should be false

    Output: 1

I am supposed to get false, but I keep getting true.

Can you tell me rationales behind how time_after, time_before macros work against jiffies overflow, and why my test case doesn't work correctly?

        /* we timed out, error ...*
    }

This code works fine when jiffies value do not overflow.
However, when jiffies overflow and wrap around to zero, this code doesn't work properly.

Linux apparently provides macros for dealing with this overflow problem

    #define time_before(unknown, known) ((long)(unkown) - (long)(known) < 0)

and code above is supposed to be safe against overflow when replaced with this macro:

    // SAFE AGAINST OVERFLOW
    if (time_before(jiffies, timeout)
    {
        /* we did not time out, good ... */
    }
    else
    {
        /* we timed out, error ...*
    }    

However, I ran through some test cases, and it doesn't work correctly.

If I do:

    unsigned long jiffies = 2147483658;
    unsigned long timeout = 10;
    printf(""%d"",time_before(jiffies,timeout)); // jiffies > timeout, so should be false

    Output: 1

I am supposed to get false, but I keep getting true.

Can you tell me rationales behind how time_after, time_before macros work against jiffies overflow, and why my test case doesn't work correctly?

Compiling flags: -std=gnu99
The program has some segmentation faults that I am debugging with GDB and Valgrind.
Valgrind flags: --track-origins=yes --leak-check=full --show-reachable=yes
I have some question about Valgrind error messages


First of all here the code explained

 - struct character: is the struct that will contain all the word that
   start with a specific letter, for example a or b or c, ecc.
 - include function: when you have to add a word into the specific structure, insert function scans the words array to see if there is an occurrance of this word. If yes, it increase the word count. Otherwise it will add the word to the array. If there is no space, the function increases array space.
 - the main is quiet linear. You can see struct for each character of the alphabet, you can see a while loop for reading lines of text file.

Why this kind of messages? I initialized all structs and arrays, ecc.ecc.",c,gdb,valgrind,,,04/22/2012 20:46:40,too localized,1,4823,9,"Valgrind Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value(s) I am writing a program to select words from a txt file.
Compiling flags: -std=gnu99
The program has some segmentation faults that I am debugging with GDB and Valgrind.
Valgrind flags: --track-origins=yes --leak-check=full --show-reachable=yes
I have some question about Valgrind error messages


First of all here the code explained

 - struct character: is the struct that will contain all the word that
   start with a specific letter, for example a or b or c, ecc.
 - include function: when you have to add a word into the specific structure, insert function scans the words array to see if there is an occurrance of this word. If yes, it increase the word count. Otherwise it will add the word to the array. If there is no space, the function increases array space.
 - the main is quiet linear. You can see struct for each character of the alphabet, you can see a while loop for reading lines of text file.

We already know that, for any two whole numbers a and b, there exist integers s and t such that as + bt = gcd(a,b). In other words, gcd(a,b) is a linear combination of a and b. gcd(a,b) is the least positive combination of the two integers. a and b themselves are expressed as trivial combinations: a = 1· + 0·b and b = 0·a + 1·b. Starting with these two, an extension of Euclid's algorithm finds s and t whose existence was so far only established in a formal way.

Write the two linear combinations in a column and apply one step of Euclid's algorithm to the left-hand side. Assuming a = bp + r. Multiply the second equation by p and subtract it from the first equation:
 	a = 1·a + 0·b
b = 0·a + 1·b
r = 1·a + (-p)·b

Apply the same procedure to the last two equations. Continue in this manner until Euclid's algorithm on the left stops. On the right, there will be the linear combination we are after. Let check this with an example: let a = 2322, b = 654. I adopt the usual convention of solving linear equations and omit all the terms in a linear combination but the left-hand side and the two coefficients on the right. The results are placed into a table with the fourth column being equal to p (from a = bp + r, which changes on each step. Multiply three numbers to the left of p by p and subtract them from the numbers directly above them. Record the results on the next line.

I know folks say to use a constant when the information doesn't change during program execution but I can't really think of a time when a variable couldn't be used instead.

I've searched, but haven't found anything nearly as comprehensive in it's coverage and cohesion for C as this reference book is for .NET.

Topics I'm looking to have addressed: 

- Use of prefixes for typedef'd structs in a library (capital letters like NextStep ""NSObject"", ""NSMutableArray"" or ""Namespace_"" approach ""MyLib_StructName""?)

- Organization of public and ""private"" header files.

- Function naming (Mutators, ""Property"" accessors, etc) AKA ""void StructNameSetProperty(int value)"" and ""int StructNameGetProperty(void)"" ?

Can someone give me a few examples of how a line of code could look different if the rules were all left-to-right or the opposite of what they were? Or why the associativity is the way it is, as it seems to me just a arbitrary choice, but I assume they had a reason for it.

Also, just to note, I do know what associativity means, I just can't think of any examples where left-to-right (or vice-versa) is better than the other choice

Here's a couple of lines of code from a sample execution:

    oper = head->next;
    head->next = head->next->next;

What this is: 

oper is a temporary reference to a single node.  I want to use it to keep track of the head of the list.

head points to a dummy node, and the real list starts on head->next.

What I want to do is to keep a temporary pointer to head->next, then pull it from the front of the list.

However, when I do this, this is what's happening (with gdb printf's):

    (gdb) n
    61          oper = head->next;
    (gdb) n
    62          head->next = head->next->next;
    (gdb) printf ""%s\n"", head->next->oper
    *
    (gdb) printf ""%p\n"", head->next

    0x6022d0

Here is more details.
I usually works in Linux and use GNU compiler (g++, gfortran, etc) and Intel compiler (icc and ifort). I can write fortran and c/c++ programs. So far, the project that I wrote is less than 10 files (with vim, no IDE so far). I usually compile them separately and put them together as a single executable file.

Now I need to modify an open source software (A software for scientific calculation. No GUI. And it reads an input file with all calculation parameters.). The source of it contains hundreds of files which is too much for me. It does come with a configure script and some makefiles. And it use both c and fortran codes (I suspect the c code calls some fortran subroutines.). But I haven't try to use fortran subroutines in c/c++.

I need to understand it, make a small modification and add some functions or subroutines in the software as new features.

Could you tell me where to start? Is there an IDE which can “import” the software as a project? Or some handy tool to draw the connections between different files? (It is horrible to read the configure script and makefile first, then start to work.)

Thanks.

I could not able to understand what is happening when it is happening.
Please help me. Let me know what is happening when each line is getting executed.
e.g. `printf` function is there, if we will see there is no statement called as ""`Enter the number`"". But still while executing it is asking ""`Enter the number`"". From where it is comming.
And why the code is written like this. It looks like ""`n!`""(Though it means factorial).

I am not interested in translating the entire perl script into C by hand.

The way I see it there are a few different options:

 1. Because the script communicates using stdin and std out, I know that I could use a system call, e.g. `system(""perl script.pl"")` and pipe the input and output, but I feel like this solution is not portable and doesn't feel very elegant.
 2. I could embed the perl interpreter into my program in order to process the script, however I feel like this would probably be bulky and would be overkill for executing a script that does not change. This does offer the advantage that instead of piping the input and output I could call the perl subroutines directly.
 3. I could use some sort of perl-to-c translation tool (like perlcc) to compile the perl source into c source at compile time and then just include it into the rest of my program. Although at first glance I thought this would be the best option there seems to be a wide consensus in the perl community (or at least the part of it that google showed me) that doing this sort of translation is not a very good idea (this might just be for speed considerations, which are not a problem at all for me). This also (might?) allow me to call the perl subroutines from within C code which would be a huge plus.
 4. Rewrite the script by hand.

So my question is this: which of these options (or none of the above) is the most elegant and portable? I understand that calling this perl program from within a C program is already a messy hack to start with, but the least messy solution would probably be best.

If it is OK to use the struct data like this, when does the data ever get freed?

</code></pre>

The struct is created locally in a function other than main, yet I was able to retrieve the data from the linked list outside of the scope of localstructtest(). Local variables are created on the stack, is this true with this struct as well? Or is it actually created on the heap and the pointer/reference remains valid? I expected this to fail horribly when I tested it. I'll admit that I am a C++ programmer and I probably don't completely understand the ramifications of there being no pass-by-reference in C. If it is OK to use the struct data like this, when does the data ever get freed?

Thanks!

Fragment shader for render to texture (fbo_shaderp) (vertex shader is the same as the display one.)

    #version 420
    in vec2 vtex_coord;
    layout(location = 0) out vec4 color;
    uniform sampler2D tex;

    void main(){
	color = texture2D(tex, vtex_coord);
	//color = vec4(1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f);

In this last shader, if i use the commented line to paint all white and comment out the 
texture one, i do get a white image but also opengl error right after rendering to texture ""OpenGL Error: invalid value"", so this actually confuses me more.

    size_t myprintf(char *fmt, ...);

So far, so good. I've decided it's best to do things the Right Way™ and make a version that takes variable arguments, and another version that takes a `va_list`.

    size_t myprintf(char *fmt, ...);
    size_t myvprintf(char *fmt, va_list args);

Not that hard to do. Except `my_vprintf()` needs to send its `args` out to two different functions (first to `snprintf()` with a length of 0 to determine how much room we need, then to `sprintf()` after we've allocated that much room). I do this with `va_copy`.

    size_t myvprintf(char *fmt, va_list args)
    {
        va_list args2;
        va_copy(args, args2);

    }

This is all fine and dandy, but C99 is a bit poorly implemented. I would like, if possible, for my code to work in C89 as well, and to work with as many compilers and on as many platforms as possible. I currently have this after `#include <stddef.h>` but before any code:

    #ifndef va_copy
    # ifdef __va_copy
    #  define va_copy(a,b) __va_copy(a,b)
    # else /* !__va_copy */
    #  define va_copy(a,b) ((a)=(b))
    # endif /* __va_copy */
    #endif /* va_copy */

I am led to believe that `((a)=(b))` is unreliable, and that I should perhaps use `memcpy()` or something similar, but this is still on the level of ""If you don't support C99, I hope it works"" rather than ""If you don't support C99, never fear"" (which is what I want). Is there any good way to get around this limitation? I've seen a few solutions - `va_list` functions that eat one argument and recurse, passing the `va_list` twice so that two separate copies are made, etc. - but I don't know how well they would work (and the recursive solution won't do so well if I just want to call `vsnprintf()`, now, will it?).

So I turn to you, StackOverflow User.

This is all fine and dandy, but C99 is a bit poorly implemented. I would like, if possible, for my code to work in C89 as well, and to work with as many compilers and on as many platforms as possible. I currently have this after `#include <stddef.h>` but before any code:

    #ifndef va_copy
    # ifdef __va_copy
    #  define va_copy(a,b) __va_copy(a,b)
    # else /* !__va_copy */
    #  define va_copy(a,b) ((a)=(b))
    # endif /* __va_copy */
    #endif /* va_copy */

I am led to believe that `((a)=(b))` is unreliable, and that I should perhaps use `memcpy()` or something similar, but this is still on the level of ""If you don't support C99, I hope it works"" rather than ""If you don't support C99, never fear"" (which is what I want). Is there any good way to get around this limitation? I've seen a few solutions - `va_list` functions that eat one argument and recurse, passing the `va_list` twice so that two separate copies are made, etc. - but I don't know how well they would work (and the recursive solution won't do so well if I just want to call `vsnprintf()`, now, will it?).

So I turn to you, StackOverflow User. Is there anything more I can do to provide C89 compatibility, or are users without `va_copy` and `__va_copy` (admittedly few and far between) just going to have to suck it in and take it?",3

",c,pointers,argv,,,07/22/2012 20:02:52,not a real question,1,200,12,"If argv[] is an array of pointer, how could printf(""%s"", argv[]) work? In the following code:

    #include<stdio.h>
    
    int main(int argc,char *argv[]){
      int index;
      for(index = 0; index < argc; index++) {
        printf(""The %d is %s\n"",index,argv[index]);
      }
      return 0;
    }

from the declaration `char *argv[]`,[cdecl][1] says it means 
`declare argv as array of pointer to char`, so I think the code should write like this :
`printf(""The %d is %s\n"",index,*argv[index]);`

as the following code:

    void give_me_ptr(int *ptr){
      printf(""the value of ptr is %p\n"", ptr);
      printf(""the value of ptr is %d\n"", *ptr);
    }
    
    int main(void){
      int a = 10,index;
      give_me_ptr(&a);
      return 0;
    }
it turns out

    the value of ptr is 0x7fff76010b48
    the value of ptr is 10
to me it means I should add * before pointer variable.

            else {         
                      topname->nright=add_node_nameANDid(topname->nright,temp2);}  
            return topname;
            } 
         return NULL;
        }


I will also give the printing functions in case the problem is there:
The print_tree prints the BST with the surnames and calls the print node to print each node:This works just fine:

          void print_tree (struct node *top)
           {	
	     if(top->left != NULL) print_tree(top->left);	
	     print_node(top);	
	     if(top->right != NULL) print_tree(top->right);
             }


The print node is""


           void print_node (struct node *top){
              if (top==NULL){
              printf(""Empty top\n"");
              return;}
              printf(""Last Name: %s\n"",top->last);    
              print_nametree (topname);   // i call the print_nametree() in order to print the first name  tree of each surname node and here the shitstorm begins i think
            }


And now the functions print_nametree() and print namenode() are the same like the others but i have changed the variables in order to print the name nodes:


      void print_nametree (struct nameANDid *topname)////////
         {    	
	   if(topname->nleft != NULL) print_nametree(topname->nleft);        	
	   print_namenode(topname);	
	   if(topname->nright != NULL) print_nametree(topname->nright);	
        }
        void print_namenode (struct nameANDid *topname){
            if (topname==NULL){
                printf(""Empty top2\n"");
                return;
            }
            printf(""\nFirst Name : %s\n"",topname->first);
            printf(""ID: %d\n"",topname->ID);  
         }



Sorry for the huge source code that i just upload but it would be very difficult to explain without this.

I thnink that i have two problems but i don't have the knowledge to solve them.

FIRST: I have to create different firstname BST for each surname node and i think that i don't do that but i don't know how to do that...


SECOND: I might have problem in the printing functios {print_nametree() and print_namenode()} which prints the names BST but i don't think so.

Any suggestions????????????????????????????????               ",c,homework,pointers,binary-search-tree,,,open,0,2135,7,"Binary Search tree inside Binary Search tree I have a homework which ask from me to create a struct of binary search tree where its node of the binary search tree is another binary search tree. The first BST has the Surnames of Students and the other one has the first names and id. Also if someone has the same surname with another student i must not create another ""surname"" node but i have to create inside the existing ""surname"" node another ""first name and Id"" node. To be more specific:

    typedef struct nameANDid{ //name and id nodes
        char first[20];
        int ID;
        struct nameANDid *nleft;
        struct nameANDid *nright;
    }yohoho;
    typedef struct node{  //surname nodes
       char last[20];  
       struct nameANDid yohoho;  
       struct node *left;
       struct node *right;
    }node;

My main problem is how to create a different nameANDid node for each firstname i found because with the following code i create 2 BST one for the surnames and another for the names but i would like to be like for example:
If i have these students

 Stallone Sylvester 11111111

 Stallone Noah      22222222

 Norris   Chuck     33333333

 Hogan    Hulk      44444444

 Hogan    Daniel    55555555

I want to store them like this:.........

 Stallone Sylvester 11111111
 
        Noah      22222222

 Norris   Chuck     33333333

 Hogan    Hulk      44444444

         Daniel    55555555

Instead of this i take something like:...........

Stallone  Sylvester 11111111.||||| Noah      22222222 |||| Chuck     33333333||||Hulk      44444444 ||||Daniel    55555555

I will put here some functions in order to be more specific 

The load function loads the names from a txt document.

    void loadData(struct node *temp){      
	int i;
	FILE *fp;
	fp=fopen(FILENAME,""r"");
	if (fp == NULL) printf(""File does not exist\n"");
	for (i=0; i<5; i++){        		
        fscanf(fp,""%s"",&temp->last);
        fscanf(fp,""%s"",&temp->yohoho.first);
        fscanf(fp,""%d"",&temp->yohoho.ID);                 
        top=add_node(top,temp);  //this function create a surname node        
        }        
	fclose(fp);     
        printf(""\n\nFile loaded\n"");  
    }

where 

            struct node temp;//just  a node pointer
            struct node *top=NULL; //shows the top of the tree


The addnode function is : ...
             
          struct node * add_node (struct node *top, struct node *temp){  
               struct node *newNode;  
               if (top == NULL){    
               newNode=(struct node *)malloc(sizeof(struct node));
               temp->left=NULL;
               temp->right=NULL;     
               if (memcpy(newNode,temp,sizeof(struct node)) == NULL){
                   printf(""Node addition failed\n"");
                   return NULL;}
               else {             
                   topname=add_node_nameANDid(topname,&temp->yohoho); //Call the add_node_nameANDid to create a new name node in the other tree                           
                   return newNode;}
                }
               else {   
                   if (stricmp(temp->last,top->last) < 0){ //Insert node surname left
                         top->left=add_node(top->left,temp);}
                   else if (stricmp(temp->last,top->last) == 0){         
                         topname=add_node_nameANDid(topname,&temp->yohoho);  //Call the add_node_nameANDid to create a new name node in the other tree   if i have the same surname        
                   }
                   else {
                         top->right=add_node(top->right,temp);           
                   }
                   return top;
                 } 
                 return NULL;
             }
        
And the add_node_nameANDid() function is like the previous function but it has some variables changed:
  
          struct nameANDid * add_node_nameANDid (struct nameANDid *topname, struct nameANDid *temp2){
            struct nameANDid *newNode_nameANDid;     
            if (topname == NULL){ 
                newNode_nameANDid=(struct nameANDid *)malloc(sizeof(struct nameANDid));
                temp2->nleft=NULL;
                temp2->nright=NULL;
                if (memcpy(newNode_nameANDid,temp2,sizeof(struct nameANDid)) == NULL){
                       printf(""Node addition failed\n"");
                       return NULL;}
                else {                 
                       return newNode_nameANDid;}
                }
            else {   
                 if (stricmp(temp2->first,topname->first) <= 0){       
                      topname->nleft=add_node_nameANDid(topname->nleft,temp2);}
            else {         
                      topname->nright=add_node_nameANDid(topname->nright,temp2);}  
            return topname;
            } 
         return NULL;
        }


I will also give the printing functions in case the problem is there:

          void print_tree (struct node *top)

	     print_node(top);	
	     if(top->right != NULL) print_tree(top->right);
             }


The print node is""


           void print_node (struct node *top){
              if (top==NULL){
              printf(""Empty top\n"");
              return;}
              printf(""Last Name: %s\n"",top->last);    
              print_nametree (topname);   // i call the print_nametree() in order to print the first name  tree of each surname node and here the shitstorm begins i think
            }


And now the functions print_nametree() and print namenode() are the same like the others but i have changed the variables in order to print the name nodes:

	   print_namenode(topname);	
	   if(topname->nright != NULL) print_nametree(topname->nright);	
        }
        void print_namenode (struct nameANDid *topname){
            if (topname==NULL){
                printf(""Empty top2\n"");
                return;
            }
            printf(""\nFirst Name : %s\n"",topname->first);

I tried to add * and / in my code. but it still can't calculate with * and /, could anyone help me to fixed this calculator? 
Oh ya, there's one more bug from my program, if we used sign - on the first number, it can't be count. example -5 + 5 -7. the -5 in the front can't be calculate, but if I put it in the middle or back it can be calculated.

The function is below:

    /* month_name: return name of n-th month */
    char *month_name(int n)
    {
    	static char *name[] = {
    		""Illegal month"",

    		""October"", ""November"", ""December""
    	};
    	return (n < 1 || n > 12) ? name[0] : name[n];
    }

My understanding is that `static` when applied to internal variable means that the variable hangs around after function returns, and still exists for the next time the function is entered.  So the only theory I could come up for why `static` is used here, is that maybe if static wasn't used, the char *name[] would be re-initialized every single time the function was entered, which would be inefficient.  I did try the function with the `static` keyword removed, and it still seemed to work fine.  So I wanted to test my theory that maybe the array was being created more than once.  I created this test, which may be totally worthless, but it's the best I could come up with:

    int main(void)
    {
    	printf(""%s\n"", month_name(1)); // print string
    	printf(""%d\n"", month_name(1)); // print address of string
    	printf(""%s\n"", month_name(1)); // print string
    	printf(""%d\n"", month_name(1)); // print address of string
    }

My theory was that if the string array was being duplicated inefficiently, the address would change for the second function call... but it remained the same.  So I even went a step further and tried to initialize another character array just to shift the allocation a bit (again, this may be totally worthless based on my limited knowledge of how allocation works):


    int main(void)
    {
    	printf(""%s\n"", month_name(1)); // print string
    	printf(""%d\n"", month_name(1)); // print address of string
    	char dummy[] = ""dummy"";
    	printf(""%s\n"", month_name(1)); // print string
    	printf(""%d\n"", month_name(1)); // print address of string
    }

But, the address of ""January"" is still the same for both function calls, even with the char *name[] in the month_name function NOT being declared as `static`.

So... couple questions.

1) What is the point of it being static?  Why is it an ideal application for internal static array?

2) Is there any merit to the logic behind my test above?

stbuf does not change at all.

Can anyone give me some suggestion about such phenomenon? I've done some work but still not find a solution.

",c,linux,filesystems,fuse,stat,,open,0,938,14,"fuse filesystem can not change the value of struct stat *stbuf in getattr function? I am doing some projects on fuse, and it got me crazy.

I send struct stat *stbuf 's data from a remote server, and the data is correct in both server and client, but when I use memcpy to duplicate the data into stbuf, it seems that nothing copied. I also try to use read(socked,stbuf,sizeof(struct stat)); directly, but that does not work too.

here is the codes...(if there is no such file, the remote server save -ENOENT in st_ino)

    static int rof_getattr(const char *path, struct stat *stbuf)
    
        {
        
        	int res = 0;
        	struct cmd sndcmd;
        	struct stat buf;
        	memset(&buf, 0,sizeof(struct stat));
        	memset(stbuf, 0, sizeof(struct stat));
        	memset(&sndcmd, 0, sizeof(struct cmd));
        
        	strcpy(sndcmd.cmd, ""GETATTR"");
        	strcpy(sndcmd.str, path);
        	write(sockfd, &sndcmd, sizeof(struct cmd));
        	
        	res=read(sockfd, &buf, sizeof(struct stat));
        	memcpy(stbuf,&buf,sizeof(buf));
        	if (buf.st_ino==-ENOENT)
        		return -ENOENT;
        
                return 0;
        }

the data I get from gdb:

    39		res=read(sockfd, &buf, sizeof(struct stat));
    3: (struct stat)stbuf = {st_dev = 694294557525955008, __pad1 = 0, __st_ino = 0,

 1a server send to client ""you are connected"" right?
 2. client send to server user,password (file 1, auth.c but i don't know how to read when client send to the server the user and password request)
 3. after successful login the server send file list (part 3, list.c, no problem)
 4. the client send to the server the file it wants to download or the changedir command (again, how to read this info from client's request?)<br>

1. Send the message and wait for the result (it can either lock or receive the response asynchronously, I don't care).
1. It has to be able to correlate between the sent message and the response.

I have tried to quit many times but really cant as I love this subject. 
My question for all the experts here is how you tackle this while reading new topic/technology?

How to you keep track of your current progress?
I have tried to search SO but cant find something.
If you have links similar question please post.

Thanks in Advance",4

	    int  *out;		/* egress flag */
	    char *actionvalue; 	/* actionvalue BLOCK or UNBLOCK */

	    int  *dstport;		/* dst port */
        char *net_dst;  	/* source and dest netmask */

I then assign values to them

    rulelist[policy_count].in = strsep(&temp, delims);
    rulelist[policy_count].out = strsep(&temp, delims); etc...

And I can then access them without a problem

However when I go to access the array the array later in the code in another function.. 

`printk(""%s"", rulelist[policy_count].in);`
 

Will crash, like it is derefrencing a null pointer.

I have read a lot about initializing instead of assigning but each example is different and I can't seem to get a good grasp on it.

I also don't understand how I can immediately access it and then not be able to in a different function. The structure is declared globally so I don't believe its a scope problem.

In actual case the parameters is written on to a memory location whose address would be assigned with appropriate data-type in the initializing structure.

But the problem I am facing is w.r.t to the data-types of the parameters to be passed/returned while calling the functions. So is there any mechanism for such kind of setup where one can be able to call any function based on number of parameters of any data-type.

	void void_func();					/* id = 0 */

	void void_func2(int, char *);		/* id = 2 */

	enum_t enum_func1(int *, int);		/* id = 12*/
	enum_t enum_func2();				/* id = 13*/



I have defined the following function pointers and parameters for calling any of the above functions:

	typedef void * (*funcptr)();
	typedef void * (*funcptr1)(void *);
	typedef void * (*funcptr2)(void *, void *);

	void * parameter1;
	void * parameter2;
	void * return_param;

I have defined a custom struct for calling all the functions:

	typedef struct funcid {
		int id;
		funcptr f0;
		funcptr1 f1;
		funcptr2 f2;
		void * param1;
		void * param2;
		void * ret_param;
	} func_id;

I have initialized the struct as below based on id (At any time only one of the above functions is called):

	func_id func_str[] = {
	/*	{ id,		f0		,		f1		,		f2		,			param1			,		param2			,			ret_param		} ,*/
		{ 0	, &void_func	,	NULL		,	NULL		, (void	*)parameter1		, (void *)parameter2	, (void *)return_param		} ,
		{ 1	,	NULL		, &void_func1	,	NULL		, (int	*)parameter1		, (void *)parameter2	, (void *)return_param		} ,
		{ 2	,	NULL		,	NULL		, &void_func2	, (int	*)parameter1		, (char *)parameter2	, (void *)return_param		} ,
		{ 3	,	NULL		, &void_func3	,	NULL		, (short int *)parameter1	, (void *)parameter2	, (void	*)return_param		} ,
		{ 4	, &int_func		,	NULL		,	NULL		, (void	*)parameter1		, (void *)parameter2	, (int	*)return_param		} ,
		{ 5	,	NULL		, &int_func1	,	NULL		, (int	*)parameter1		, (void *)parameter2	, (int	*)return_param		} ,
		{ 6	,	NULL		, &int_func2	,	NULL		, (float*)parameter1		, (void *)parameter2	, (int	*)return_param		} ,
		{ 7	,	NULL		,	NULL		, &int_func3	, (int	*)parameter1		, (int	*)parameter2	, (int	*)return_param		} ,

Now in a switch case statement I am trying to call any of the functions:

	printf(""\nEnter Number of parameters of functions : "");
	scanf(""%d"", ptr1);
	
	printf(""\nEnter whether the function has a return value (0/1) : "");
	scanf(""%d"", &ret);
	
	printf(""\nWhich function to execute (function id): "");
	scanf(""%d"", &var1);
	
	if (*ptr1 > 0)
		printf(""\nEnter the Parameters : \n"");

	func_id current_func;
	
	for (i=0; i<13; i++){
		if (func_str[i].id == var1) {
			current_func = func_str[i];
			break;
		}
	}

	switch(*ptr1) {

		case 0: {
			if (ret == 1) {
				printf(""\nEntering case 0\n"");
				current_func.ret_param = (*current_func.f0)();
			}
			else {
				(*current_func.f0)();
			}
			break;
			}
        /* In actual case the parameters would be read from a memory location and the address of that can be stored in parameter1 */
		case 1: {
			printf(""\nEnter Parameter 1: "");
			scanf(""%d"", parameter1); 
			printf(""\nParameter 1 = %d\n"",*(int *)parameter1);
			if (ret == 1) {
				current_func.ret_param = (*current_func.f1)(current_func.param1);
			}
			else {
				(*current_func.f1)(current_func.param1);
			}
			break;
			}
        /* In actual case the parameters would be written in a memory location and the address of that can be stored in parameter1 and parameter2 */
		case 2: { 
			printf(""\nEnter Parameter 1: "");
			scanf(""%d"", parameter1);
			printf(""\nEnter Parameter 2: "");
			scanf(""%d"", parameter2);
			if (ret == 1) {
				current_func.ret_param = (*current_func.f2)(current_func.param1, current_func.param2);
				printf(""\nReturned parameter : current_func.ret_param = %d"", *(int *)current_func.ret_param);
			}
			else {
				(*current_func.f2)(current_func.param1, current_func.param2);
			}
			break;
			}
		default:
			printf(""ERROR"");
	}


In actual case the parameters is written on to a memory location whose address would be assigned with appropriate data-type in the initializing structure.

But the problem I am facing is w.r.t to the data-types of the parameters to be passed/returned while calling the functions. So is there any mechanism for such kind of setup where one can be able to call any function based on number of parameters of any data-type.

What I observed is that inside an openMP parallel block, the for loop is not vectorized even in the case where I include the *#pragma always vector* directive. For the compilation I am using the pathscale compiler. 

The code I want to vectorize looks like this : 

      #pragma omp parallel shared(in, out, lambda,dim,C) private(k)
         {
                #pragma omp for  schedule(guided,dim/nthreads)  nowait

                }
        }

where out,lambda and in are double precision arrays. 

But even if I include *#pragma always vector*, what the compiler answers is : 

     warning: ignoring #pragma always vector

Do you know if there is any workaround for this? 

Thanks.

My device conatins cpu, memory, sd card chip, LCD, Keyboard, USB port, Audio-video port etc. Please suggest the first step to take. I googled a lot and find various ideas but I think discussion forums are the best place to start. What are the prerequisites? How to proceed? please suggest.. thanks...",4

    // say the number is 1000
    (int)(log(1000)/log(10)) + 1

This is based on mathematical formula

`log`<sub>10</sub>`x = log`<sub>n</sub>`x/log`<sub>n</sub>`10` (explained [here][1])

But I found out, that in C,

    (int)(log(1000)/log(10)) + 1

is **NOT** equal to

    (int) log10(1000) + 1

but it should be. 

I even tried the same thing in Java with this code

    (int) (Math.log(1000) / Math.log(10)) + 1
    (int) Math.log10(1000) + 1

but it behave the same wrong way.

The story continues. After executing this code
    
    for (int i = 10; i < 10000000; i *= 10) {
       System.out.println(((int) (Math.log10(i)) + 1) + 
                    "" "" + ((int) (Math.log(i) / Math.log(10)) + 1));
    }
  
I get

    4 3  // here second method produces wrong result for 1000
    5 5
    6 6
    7 6  // here again

So the bug seems to occur on every multiple of 1000.

I showed this to my C teacher, and he said that it might be caused by some type conversion error during log division, but he didn't know why.

So my questions are

- **Why isn't `(int) (Math.log(1000) / Math.log(10)) + 1` equal to `(int) Math.log10(1000) + 1

I basically want to confirm that in the for loop in main, the following statement

    copy_employee(&employee_of_the_day, &eotd);

could be executed by ANY of the 3 threads; am I right? 
The fact that the subsequent comparisons are obviously not atomic raises some confusions. Any clarifications/corrections to this will be greatly helpful.

Incidentally, any good recommendations for tutorials on multithreading in C?

Thanks a lot!

""Explain or contrast pass-by-value and pass-by-reference in C""

I tell the interviewee that the question has nothing to do with C++ references and I'm looking for an explanation of passing a pointer to a variable vs. a variable and how the callee can modify the variable referenced by the pointer. Extra points for explanation about how passing pointers to structs is more efficient.

Here's the question: is there really ""pass by reference"" in C? 

The signature of the callee clearly defines what's being passed. It's not like you can pass either x or &x to a function and have the compiler figure out what to do. So I would argue that everything is C is pass by value and pass-by-reference is really just passing the value of a pointer. 

Is there something fundamentally different about

Here is my struct:

    typedef struct {
        Car *buffer[CAR_PARK_SIZE];       
        char *arrival_time[CAR_PARK_SIZE]; 
        int  keep_running;		         
        int  size;

    typedef struct {
    	Car *buffer[MAX_QUEUE_SIZE];
    	char *arrival_time[MAX_QUEUE_SIZE];
    	int keep_running;
    	int size;
    	int index;
    	} CarQueue;
    
    typedef struct {
        char str[3];
        int id;
    } Car;

I'll try to talk this out and hopefully i've provided enough information for someone to find out where the problem may lie, the problem is to do with the pointer in the CarQueue buffer, which is meant to be an array of car pointers. When my code runs, it seems to write the same pointer to ever item in the CarQueue buffer, here's the play by play.

_cq = CarQueue, _cp = CarPark

They are both globals

My thread calls these lines to generate a new car struct.

    Car c;
    c = new_car();
    printf(""[A] Car Arrived with ID: %s\n"", get_car_id(&c));
    				
    pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex);
    _cq.size++;
    _cq.index++;
    _cq.buffer[_cq.index] = &c;
    				
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex);

This should put the pointer of the new car structure into the the CarQueue buffer.

The next thread than attempts to take the pointer out of that array, and stick it into its own, and then remove it from the old array. CarPark takes the pointer of the car, puts it into it's storage array, and then removes it from CarQueue (or in this case, just increases the index and overrides it later).

    pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex);
    _cp.buffer[_cp.size] = _cq.buffer[_cq.index]; //should take the pointer and put it into its own
    printf(""[C] Car Parked -> %s\n"", get_car_id(_cp.buffer[_cp.size])); //gets the right information
    _cp.size++;
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex);

I think the problem lies around where the comment in the code is, but I am not certain. Eventually if I print out the array in CarPark, all it's items seem to be the exact same. Am I passing a wrong pointer to a pointer somewhere accidentally? 

if I traverse through the CarPark array and print it out like the following

    printf(""| element %d is  %s with pointer %d |\n"", j, get_car_id(_cp.buffer[j]), _cp.buffer[j]);

I have searched and searched and tried countless things but cannot seem to read these as individual names into an array of strings(I think thats the right way to store them individually?)

PLEASE advise me as to how to read it in with format.  I have previously used sscanf on the input buffer and that has worked fine, but I dont feel like I can do that on a 45000+ char line? Am I correct in assuming this?  Is this even an acceptable way to read strings into an array?

What I am trying to do is to create an array using the Aurdino Uno to sort 50 random numbers between the range of 0 - 255 which will be represented using binary and then displaying the results using 8 leds and the serial monitor 

while looking on the Aurdino Uno website I manage to find an example of an array here is the code:

    int timer = 100;           // The higher the number, the slower the timing.
    int ledPins[] = {
    2, 7, 4, 6, 5, 3 };       // an array of pin numbers to which LEDs are attached
    int pinCount = 6;           // the number of pins (i.e. the length of the array)

    void setup() {
    int thisPin;
    // the array elements are numbered from 0 to (pinCount - 1).
    // use a for loop to initialize each pin as an output:
    for (int thisPin = 0; thisPin < pinCount; thisPin++)  {
    pinMode(ledPins[thisPin], OUTPUT);      
    }
    }

    void loop() {
    // loop from the lowest pin to the highest:
    for (int thisPin = 0; thisPin < pinCount; thisPin++) {
    // turn the pin on:
    digitalWrite(ledPins[thisPin], HIGH);  
    delay(timer);                  
    // turn the pin off:
    digitalWrite(ledPins[thisPin], LOW);    

    }

    // loop from the highest pin to the lowest:
    for (int thisPin = pinCount - 1; thisPin >= 0; thisPin--) {
    // turn the pin on:
    digitalWrite(ledPins[thisPin], HIGH);
    delay(timer);
    // turn the pin off:
    digitalWrite(ledPins[thisPin], LOW);
    }
    }*emphasized text*
   
what my question is how would I change/use this code that I've have found to get the results mentioned above 


P.S I'm sorry if this question is not for this type of forum.

    data 5 saved

 

I was thinking with straight forward solution which is get the rows with sorting the date and try to process them one by one then get another set of row, but I don't think that is sufficient as I need to select the whole table and sort it then process it, I Imagine if I have millions of rows then that will be really bad. 

And is it possible to use something else other than DB to do this for the described above? and please keep in mind that I need the data to be saved on a disk in case the server restarted.

",c,database,linux,query,,,open,0,255,8,"Queue data in DB (MYSQL) based on time What is the best way to retrieve data based on the time they entered the DB?

for example, the following saved in a DB 

    data 1 saved now 
    data 2 saved now+1
    data 3 saved now+2
    data 4 saved now+3
    data 5 saved now+4


Then what is the best way to get data 1, data 2 then 3, like a fifo 

and the other question is let's say data data 3 failed to be processed then what is the best way to save it again with new time value so it will be processed after 4 and before 5, so it will be like so,

should we create a new array for the insertion of each and every integer?
What should we do if we want insert more number of integers into the sorted array?
Can we do this with pointers?

    #define F_TO_C 1
    void convert (double *temperature, int mode)
    {

    *temperature = 1.8*(*temperature) + 32.0;
    else
    *temperature = (*temperature - 32.0)/1.8;

The first Telnet client test was on another Linux laptop. It works as expected. The next, however, was a Blackberry app called BBSSH that allows Telnet and SSH connections. I went via the Telnet option, and it works too. Except, it doesn't exactly.

The server code does the usual `read` call to retrieve a block of data, which gets treated as a string, i.e. a message. The former client reads until I hit enter, and then it sends one string of characters. The BB app, however, sends every single character as if I've been pressing enter after each of them, which I haven't. Obviously this is something to do with buffering, what certain clients class as a EOL from the user input, etc. I just can't pinpoint it.

To illustrate, here is the server outputting messages it's received from the clients.

First, the message from the Linux client:

    client name: this is a test

Now, for BBSSH:

    client name: t
    client name: h
    client name: i

Suppose that a university wants to show off how progressive it is and ends its long standing practice of gender-segregated bathrooms on campus. However, as a concession to propriety, it makes a policy that when a woman is in the bathroom only other women may enter, but not men, and vice versa.

The program must execute for at least 20 cycles (a cycle is defined as one iteration of a person entering the queue if unable to enter the bathroom, and/or entering the bathroom if eligible and/or exiting the bathroom).

The program must display the following during its execution: the number of the cycle, the state of the bathroom (empty, occupied by women and if so how many, occupied by men and if so how many, the status of the queue including whether it is empty or not and if not empty what genders are in queue and where their position is in the queue).

There is no maximum limit to how many people can use the bathroom, but I have set it to 3.

I also want this to be a fully automated process, and thus have used a random number for entering and leaving the bathroom, and whether it is a man that is entering and leaving or a woman.

",c,2d-array,deallocate,,,,open,0,144,5,"free 2d array in c I was solving some simple pointer exercises when i came across the following example:

    void deallocate2D(int** array, int nrows) {     
     /*  deallocate each row  */
     int i;
     for(i = 0; i < nrows; i++) {

     }
     
     /*  deallocate array of pointers  */
     free(array);     
    }

The array is defined in main as int** array1;

I'm struggling with a few major questions:

 1. How do I actually search for the command `cat`?  Keep in mind this program uses C.  What functions can I use to search through directories?  How do I use PATH to do this?
 2. When I do find the command `cat`, how can I run it with `foo.txt` as a parameter?  How can this be done in C?

 Now I want to run the `cat` executable with the argument `foo.txt`.  I realize I should use the `$PATH` variable to try to find the executable and then run it with this argument. 

I'm struggling with a few major questions:

 1. How do I actually search for the command `cat`?  Keep in mind this program uses C.  What functions can I use to search through directories?  How do I use PATH to do this?
 2. When I do find the command `cat`, how can I run it with `foo.txt` as a parameter?  How can this be done in C?

**My question is**: Is there a way to find out how much memory is really used up by a particular `malloc` call, including the effective cost of alignment, and the overhead used by `malloc`/`free`?

Just to be clear, I am _not_ asking to find out how much memory a pointer points to after a call to `malloc`.  Rather, I am debugging a program that uses a great deal of memory, and I want to be aware of which parts of the code are allocating how much memory.  I'd like to be able to have internal memory accounting that very closely matches the numbers reported by top.  Ideally, I'd like to be able to do this programmatically on a per-`malloc`-call basis, as opposed to getting a summary at a checkpoint.

This is a trick that simplifies implementation of various algorithms involving linked lists and I'm wondering if anybody else has encountered this.

Say we have a linked list record defined so:

    typedef struct _record
    {
    	char* value;
    	struct _record* next;
    } record;

We need a function that inserts a new record so that the entire list remains sorted with respect to the value's in the records. The following implementation is simpler than anything I would have used, albeit less readable.

    void insert_sorted(record** r, const char* value)
    {
    	record* newrec = NULL;
    	while(*r && strcmp(value, (*r)->value) > 0)
    		r = &((*r)->next); /* move r to point to the next field of the record */
    	newrec = malloc(sizeof(record));
    	newrec->value = strdup(value);
    	newrec->next = *r;
    	*r = newrec;
    }

When the function is called, r points to the head pointer of the list. During the while loop, r is updated to point to the `next` field of the record that comes just before the point where we want to put the new record in. The last line of the function either updates the head pointer of the list (if the insertion happens at the beginning) or the `next` field of the previous record, which is quite cool.

A couple of questions:

 * Does this idiom have a name or is it mentioned in any literature?

 * Are there others like it in the C language?

",c,struct,opencl,,,,open,0,2758,6,"OpenCL struct argument invalid address space I'm a total beginner with OpenCL and I'm trying to make the following kernel to work. When I run the program I get an error in the build process of the kernel program. More specificity the error is the following:

You can see the kernel here. In the beginning I though that it was because I hadn't the structs defined inside the kernel but even when I added them the problem still exists. What am I doing wrong here?

First, allow me to explain the data that is being stored, and where it's being stored. So first some definitions. The layout of a record is broken up into a **Record Directory** and **Record Data**.

    [Field count=N] [Field offset[0]] [...] [Field offset[N-1]] [Data for fields 0 to N]

 - The field count and offsets combined are called the Record Directory.
 
 - The data is called the Record Data.

 - The field count is of type
   `uint16_t`.
   
 - The field offset is of type
   `uint16_t`.
   
 - The data fields can be treated as a variable length byte buffer pointed to by `(uint8_t *)` with a length of at least N bytes.


 - The field count cannot exceed: 4095 or 0x0FFF (in big endian).


The records are stored in a Page:

  - Pages are of size: 4096 bytes.

  - Pages need to store 2 bytes of data for each record.

  - The last 6 bytes of the page stores the running free space offset, and data for a slot directory. The metadata is irrelevant to the question, so I will not bore anyone with the details.


We're storing records on the page, by appending to the running free space offset, and appending to it. Records can later be altered and deleted. This will leave unused space fragments on the page. This data is not reused until time of compaction.

At the moment, we store a fragment byte of 0x80 in unused space (since the free space cannot exceed 0x0FFF, the first byte will never be 0x80).

However this becomes a problem during compaction time. We end up scanning everything until we hit the first byte that is not 0x80. We consider this the start of the free space. Well unfortunately, this is not portable and will only work on big endian machines.

But just to restate the issue here, the problem is distinguishing between: `0x808000` and `0x800080` where the first two bytes (read right to left) are two valid Field count fields depending on the endianness of the platform.

I want to try aligning records on even bytes. I just don't have the foresight to see if this would be a correct workaround for this issue.

At any given time, the free space offset should always sit on an even byte boundary. This means after inserting a record, you advance the free space pointer to the next even boundary.

The problem then becomes an issue of marking the fragments. Fragments are created upon deletion or altering a record (growing/shrinking by some number of bytes). I wanted to store what I would call 2-byte fragment markers: 0xFFFF. But that doesn't seem possible when altering.

This is where I'm stuck. Sorry for the long-winded problem explanation. We (my partner, this is an academic assignment) battled the problem of data ambiguity several times, and it keeps masking itself under different solutions.

Any insight would help. I hope the problem statement can be followed.

    myvar = (myGpiocIdrReadFunc() >> 6) & 0x03;   // Read bits 6 and 7
    myGpiodClrWriteFunc &= 0xFFFFFF0F;

GPIOx's are #defined as pointers to a physical address. Of course if I try to read and write directly to addresses on my PC with an executable built with x86, that would be access violation. Unfortunately if I try something like this:

    #define GPIOC->IDR { myGpiocIdrReadFunc() }

the compiler doesn't like that ""->"", saying ""missing whitespace after the macro name.""

If you've solved this kind of problem before, how did you do it?

I really do want an answer to this though, so think before downvoting this question and closing it. I don't have enough information myself to be very specific. If I did, this question would probably be solved already. Please help me understand more about this problem instead of assuming that I am too lazy or disinterested in my question to write more about it. In my opinion, this should not be down-voted and closed. And I have read the FAQ.

I am rendering a 3D fractal in C, and with the addition of code to calculate surface normals, the code stops working (no error, no weird result, just freezes). If a printf statement is added in, as below, the code continues to run, but it is too slow to get a result in a reasonable time period because printf statements are themselves very slow. If the printf statement is moved to before the Vunit function call (makes a vector into a unit vector), the code stops working again. It was suggested that the printf statement is moving around memory or padding the stack, but I am not fully sure what this means.

",c,memory,stack,printf,,01/29/2012 14:54:33,too localized,1,326,7,"C printf makes previously broken code work I have already asked this question (http://stackoverflow.com/q/9050326/901812) but I did not post my source code the first time so it was somewhat vague and the question was closed. I really do want an answer to this though, so think before downvoting this question and closing it. I don't have enough information myself to be very specific. If I did, this question would probably be solved already. Please help me understand more about this problem instead of assuming that I am too lazy or disinterested in my question to write more about it. In my opinion, this should not be down-voted and closed. And I have read the FAQ.

I am rendering a 3D fractal in C, and with the addition of code to calculate surface normals, the code stops working (no error, no weird result, just freezes). If a printf statement is added in, as below, the code continues to run, but it is too slow to get a result in a reasonable time period because printf statements are themselves very slow. If the printf statement is moved to before the Vunit function call (makes a vector into a unit vector), the code stops working again. It was suggested that the printf statement is moving around memory or padding the stack, but I am not fully sure what this means.

    1) ret = write( fd_out, local_bugger, bytes_to_move);

    2) nwritten = write (fd, buf + total_written, size - total_written);

Obviously, not the naming conventions. 

Specifically, one is writing over the network 4x faster than the other. 

Looking for logic , flags, etc

Second, does it perform as well as C?  At least close.

Third, does it have improved array/string handling?  Probably the biggest security flaw with C is how arrays/strings are handled since it's just a pointer and the end of the string is a null character.  Also, without range checking, you can read past the end of the array.

Fourth, does it have features to make concurrency easier and safer to use?

Lastly, is it suitable for environments other than PCs?

        this time, it is not random but sort the numbers in bundles per row
        stack all the bundles on top of each other, keeping the row selected to be in the centre.
        rearrange it back into rows of 7 such that first number in stack goes to row 1, second to row 2, third to row 3, 4th to row 1 again and so on.
    7. again ask the player to select the row the number is in.
    8. repeat step 6
    9. again ask the player to select the row the number is in.
    10. point to the middle number of the row selected as the answer.

    1. The deck contains 21 unique numbers
    2. The numbers shld be laid up in rows of 7( 3 rows in total)
    3. ask the player to memorize a number to start the game
    4. once the game starts, rearrange the numbers in random in all rows.
    5. ask the player to select the row the number is in.
    6. once the player selects, rearrange the numbers for a second time
        this time, it is not random but sort the numbers in bundles per row
        stack all the bundles on top of each other, keeping the row selected to be in the centre.
        rearrange it back into rows of 7 such that first number in stack goes to row 1, second to row 2, third to row 3, 4th to row 1 again and so on.

    uint32 * mem_loc = malloc some memory;
    int i = 0;
    int offset = 1; 
    uint32 * location = &mem_loc;
    
    while ((&mem_loc)++ && (!int))  {
       &mem_loc = pattern;
       if (!(&(mem_loc+offet))) { 
          mem_loc = location;
          pattern = 0x55555555;
          i++;
       }
    }
  
    //Check to see if values written are consistent

Would the code above work?? Will writing out the hex patterns to memory turn the bits on in the pattern?

I know the code above is horribly mangled but I just want to get an idea if doing something like that with the correct logic will achieve the desired result.

Now, I want to allocate more memory. Obviously my previous ""page"" won't be enough. So I have at least two options:

  1. Use realloc(page, NEW_SIZE), where NEW_SIZE > PAGE_SIZE;
  2. Allocate a new ""page""(page2) and put the new object there.

If I wanted to have a custom allocate function, then:

  1. Using the first method, I'd see how much I had filled, and then put my new object there(and add the size of the object to my filled memory variable).
  2. Using the second method, I'd have a list(vector? array?) of pages, then look for the current page, and then use a method similar to 1 on the selected page.

Eventually, I'd need a method to free memory too, but I can figure out that part.

So my question is: **What is the most efficient way to solve a problem like this? Is it option 1, option 2 or some other option I haven't considered here? Is a small benchmark needed/enough to draw conclusions for real-world situations?**
I understand that different operations may perform differently, but I'm looking for an overall metric.",5

I have googled around, but i cant seem to find an implentation for a iterative language. So i'm trying to figure it out myself, but i've hit a snag. Lets define the problem a bit clearer

 Say i have an array of arrays which looks like this

    A = { {1}, {2, 3}, {4, 5, 6} }

how do i go from that to

    B = { {1, 2, 4}, {1, 2, 5}, {1, 2, 6}, {1, 3, 4}, {1, 2, 5}, {1, 2, 6} }

If x is the number of elements in the outer array, and y[] is a dynamic array of length x, the elements containing the number of elements in the inner array. Then the x of A becomes the y of B, and the x of B is the multiplicative sum of y's in A. (not proven, assumed from examples)

Since the x of A is dynamic, the function has to be recursive. Heres my try.

    int** cartesian (int** A, int x, int* y, int* newx, int* newy) {
      *newy = x;
      *newx = 1;
      for (int i = 0; i < x; i++)
        *newx *= y[i];
      int** B = malloc(sizeof(int) * *newx * *newy);

      int xi = 0;
      int* tmp_prod = malloc(sizeof(int) * x);
      recurse(x, 0, y, A, &xi, tmp_prod, B);
      free(tmp_prod);

      return B;
    }

    void recurse(int x, int xi, int* y, int** A, int* newx, int* temp_inner, int** B) {
      if (xi < x) {
        for (int i = 0; i < y[xi]; i++) {
          temp_inner[xi] = A[xi][i];
          recurse(x, xi + 1, y, A, newx, temp_inner, B);
        }
      } else {
        for (int i = 0; i < x; i++) {
          B[*newx][i] = temp_inner[i];
        }
        (*newx)++;
      }
    }

This is as far as i have gotten. The recursive function builds up a temporary array of one element of a[depth of recursion], then when its at maxdepth, it assigns that B, and increases Bs iterator, backtracks and selects the next element of a[depth of recursion], et c.

If x is the number of elements in the outer array, and y[] is a dynamic array of length x, the elements containing the number of elements in the inner array. Then the x of A becomes the y of B, and the x of B is the multiplicative sum of y's in A. (not proven, assumed from examples)

Since the x of A is dynamic, the function has to be recursive. Heres my try.

    int** cartesian (int** A, int x, int* y, int* newx, int* newy) {
      *newy = x;
      *newx = 1;
      for (int i = 0; i < x; i++)
        *newx *= y[i];
      int** B = malloc(sizeof(int) * *newx * *newy);

      int xi = 0;
      int* tmp_prod = malloc(sizeof(int) * x);
      recurse(x, 0, y, A, &xi, tmp_prod, B);
      free(tmp_prod);

      return B;
    }

    void recurse(int x, int xi, int* y, int** A, int* newx, int* temp_inner, int** B) {
      if (xi < x) {
        for (int i = 0; i < y[xi]; i++) {
          temp_inner[xi] = A[xi][i];
          recurse(x, xi + 1, y, A, newx, temp_inner, B);
        }
      } else {
        for (int i = 0; i < x; i++) {
          B[*newx][i] = temp_inner[i];
        }
        (*newx)++;
      }
    }

This is as far as i have gotten. The recursive function builds up a temporary array of one element of a[depth of recursion], then when its at maxdepth, it assigns that B, and increases Bs iterator, backtracks and selects the next element of a[depth of recursion], et c.

The problem being segfaults and i cant figure out why. ",1

Please, Help me. I dont have idea how can i do this.
after, i want to looking for a X number in the array but I think that maybe i know how to do that.! jaja maybe.

thanks.! :D

I need to add **permanent** arp entry in Linux somehow. 

The problem is: if I add an entry via shell, or via sockets, it always gets **flag 0x6**. Even if I use the code posted downhere, where I specify the flag, it remains the same, 0x6. 

I found this information about 0x6 flag: 

> Notice the ARP flag of ""0x6"".  The ASIC ARP entry with flag 0x6 is
> MAC-cache related entry.   It is caused by arp lookup failure when

> address.  We can get the MAC address when the reply packet arrives by
> sending an ARP packet to the source host.

So anytime I add any arp entry, then I ping the same ip address, it always results in **ARP request broadcast**. 

The question is, **is there a way how to add a permanent ARP entry with proper flag? So I add an entry, and in case of any comunication afterwards, there wont be any ARP broadcast?**


Btw, to get into what I am up to: I am sending a packet(L3) from PC1 to PC2 containing PC1's IP and MAC, PC2 adds them into ARP table and establish TCP session, but always first run ARP broadcast.

On the door of every bathroom there will be a sign with a sliding marker that will indicate one of three possible states it is currently in:

Empty, Women Present, Men Present

The program must execute for at least 20 cycles (a cycle is defined as one iteration of a person entering the queue if unable to enter the bathroom, and/or entering the bathroom if eligible and/or exiting the bathroom).

The program must contain the procedures 'woman_wants_to_enter', 'man_wants_to_enter', 'woman_leaves', 'man_leaves'.

The program must display the following during its execution: the number of the cycle, the state of the bathroom (empty, occupied by women and if so how many, occupied by men and if so how many, the status of the queue including whether it is empty or not and if not empty what genders are in queue and where their position is in the queue).

The use of semaphores is not required, and the solution can be presented in any way as long as its in the C language.

I would really appreciate any help on this.",c,semaphore,,,,12/08/2010 17:09:43,not a real question,1,261,5,"Unisex Bathroom Problem in C I have a homework assignment in C where I am trying to solve the classic Unisex bathroom problem.

It gives me a couple of errors, says my cmpl doesn't work do you need to compare 2 registers only?

also it says 8(ebp) is junk??? I thought that was the argv1.

the stack should be set up by the function. I assume my return does not work because I can't get the reverse engineer to do it properly. I never get there however because gcc says 0x7FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF truncates to 0x00000000FFFFFFFF.

Do I need to set up the stack even though the function definition already does it?

How do i return a float?

Why do i get 0x00000000FFFFFFFF from my and statement?

This program operate beneath procedure

1. set progaddr to start address(default value is 0)
2. set loader PROGRAM_NAME.obj file to load.
3. Check memory well uploaded into array(in 20081610.c)
4. repeat 1 to 3.
5. quit command

However, when I type quit or loader set over and over again(2 or 5 command repeatedly), this program occurres 'glibc detecting' error.

*The only case that error does not occurred is time when I did not set up progaddr(Just using default value). When I modify progaddr(procedure 1), glibc error occurred.
How can I solve this problem?",c,malloc,free,,,06/02/2012 22:21:37,not a real question,1,4174,9,"How can I solve 'glibc detected' error in C? When I was making SIC/XE Memory load machine(System programming class) in C. I found glibc error. I have never seen before this error, so I do not handle how to solve it.

This program operate beneath procedure

1. set progaddr to start address(default value is 0)
2. set loader PROGRAM_NAME.obj file to load.
3. Check memory well uploaded into array(in 20081610.c)
4. repeat 1 to 3.
5. quit command

However, when I type quit or loader set over and over again(2 or 5 command repeatedly), this program occurres 'glibc detecting' error.

*The only case that error does not occurred is time when I did not set up progaddr(Just using default value). When I modify progaddr(procedure 1), glibc error occurred.
How can I solve this problem?",3

In fact, all of the time fields (atime, mtime, ctime) are missing and therefore the struct contains some atim, mtim and ctim values which return a timespec instead of the desired time_t value.

Now my questions:

1. Why is this so? Maybe I included the wrong header but I'm really sure it's gotta be sys/stat.h.

2. I have not been finding too much information about timespec, what is it and why is it returned here?

3. Even if I find a workaround, does it help m or will any other system fail to execute my code?

I am using Ubuntu 11.10 and gcc 4.6.1.

My code (partly):

    struct stat file_info;
    	time_t t;
    
    	if( lstat( path, &file_info ) == 0 ) {
    
    		struct tm* timeinfo;
    		t = file_info.st_ctime;
    		timeinfo = localtime( &t );

    
    

I'd be really glad if you could help with this one, I really got no clue why I can not compile using the st_ctime field of my  struct and as usual gcc is not too much of a help when it comes to talking about errors ;-)

Probably it's got to do something with #include problems, but I'm not able to determine what.

-------

I would like keys to act in a different way according to the focussed window.


### An example

Consider the following scenario, `[w1]`, `[w2]` and `[w3]` are fixed-size tiled windows.

       +---[w1]----+-------[w2]-------+
       |           | ................ |
       |  Entry_1  | ................ |
       |  Entry_2  | ................ |
       |           | ................ |
       +-----------+-[w3]-------------+
       |  Logs here                   |
       +------------------------------+

I want <kbd>j</kbd> to act like follows:

  * In `[w1]` I want to select the following entry, like in a menu.
  * In `[w2]` I have some _free editable space_ (the dots), so I want to move the cursor to `(x, y+1)` position.
  * In `[w3]` I want to `scroll()` down the log.


<br />
Solution
--------
To achieve the window-specific key binding I thought to act like follows.

I keep track of the currently focussed window in a global variable, `focus_on`.

    enum { W1, W2, W3 };
    int focus_on = W1;

I keep a `WINDOW *` array, so I can do something like this:

    WINDOW *win[3];
    char ch;

    /* Initialization for win[W1], win[W2], win[W3] */

    /* Then in loop */
    ch = wgetch( win[focus_on] );

    switch (ch)
    {
      case 'j':
        if (focus_on == W1)
          select_next_entry();

        else if (focus_on == W2)
          move_cursor_down();

        else if (focus_on == W3)
          scroll_log_down();
        break;
    }

Acting this way key inhibition is straightforward, it's enough to omit the `if`-condition in key's corresponding `case`.

I'm using a `WINDOW *` array for simplicity. I think using an array (or a list) can help managing the focus change.


<br />
Question
--------
My questions are:

  1. Is the solution I proposed good enough? Is it a good practice?
  2. Are there better ways to achieve what I want?

There you go: create_handle() performs a malloc() to create an 'instance'. A construction often used to prevent having to malloc() is to change the prototype of create_handle() like this:

    void create_handle(handle_t *handle);

And then the caller could create the handle this way:

    // In file caller.c
    void i_am_the_caller() {
        handle_t a_handle;    // Allocate a handle on the stack instead of malloc()
        create_handle(&a_handle);
        // ... a_handle is ready to go!
    }

But unfortunately this code is obviously invalid, the size of handle_t isn't known!

I never really found a solution to solve this in a proper way. I'd very like to know if anyone has a proper way of doing this, or maybe a complete different approach to enable data hiding in C (not using static globals in the module.c of course, one must be able to create multiple instances).

For example, if string one is `ratandcat` and string two is `cat`. Then it is true that string two ends in string one. To solve this, I came up with half a solution and I got struck with pointers. 

My idea is to find the position where string one ends and also the position the string two starts, so that I can proceed further. I have this code:

    int strEnd(char *s,char *t){
    	int ans,slength =0 ,tlength = 0;
    	while(*s++)
    		slength++;

For example, if string one is `ratandcat` and string two is `cat`. Then it is true that string two ends in string one. To solve this, I came up with half a solution and I got struck with pointers. 

My idea is to find the position where string one ends and also the position the string two starts, so that I can proceed further. I have this code:

    int strEnd(char *s,char *t){

Question
Strings 
You are given 'n' strings w1, w2, ......, wn. Let Si denote the set of strings formed by considering all unique substrings of the string wi. A substring is defined as a contiguous sequence of one or more characters in the string. More information on substrings can be found here. Let 'S' = {S1 U S2 U .... Sn} .i.e 'S' is a set of strings formed by considering all the unique strings in all sets S1, S2, ..... Sn. You will be given many queries and for each query, you will be given an integer 'k'. Your task is to output the lexicographically kth smallest string from the set 'S'.
 

    Input:
        The first line of input contains a single integer 'n', denoting the number of strings. Each of the next 'n' lines consists of a string. The string on the ith line (1<=i<=n) is denoted by wi and has a length mi. The next line consists of a single integer 'q', denoting the number of queries. Each of the next 'q' lines consists of a single integer 'k'.
        Note: The input strings consist only of lowercase english alphabets 'a' - 'z'.
         
        Output:
        Output 'q' lines, where the ith line consists of a string which is the answer to the ith query. If the input is invalid ('k' > |S|), output ""INVALID"" (quotes for clarity) for that case.
        
        Constraints:
        1<=n<=50

If we take advantage of the property that bit shifting to the left is equivalent to multiplying by 2 to the power of the number of bits shifted, we can bit-shift up to the nearest power of 2, and use our previous algorithm to add up from there. So, our code would now look something like this:

    #include <math.h>
    
    int log2( double n )
    {
    	return log(n) / log(2);
    }
    
    int mult(int multiplicand, int multiplier)
    {
    	int nearest_power = 2 ^ (floor(log2(multiplier)));
    	multiplicand << nearest_power;
    	for (int i = nearest_power; i < multiplier; i++)
    	{
    		multiplicand += multiplier;
    	}
    	
    	return multiplicand;
    }

I'm having trouble determining what the time complexity of this algorithm is. I don't believe that `O(n - 2^(floor(log2(n))))` is the correct way to express this, although (I think?) it's technically correct. Can anyone provide some insight on this?",c,performance,complexity,big-o,,,open,0,281,9,"What is the time complexity of this multiplication algorithm? For the classic interview question ""How do you perform integer multiplication without the multiplication operator?"", the easiest answer is, of course, the following linear-time algorithm in C:

One would think `RAND_MAX` should be a `signed int` since that's what `rand()` returns.

However, I've found that some compilers define it as unsigned:

* The not so ancient C++ Builder 5.5: #define RAND_MAX <b>0x7FFFU</b>
* The still alive Open Watcom C/C++ 1.9: #define RAND_MAX <b>32767U</b>
* DJGPP (gcc 3.3.4 for DOS): #define RAND_MAX 2147483647

* Digital Mars C/C++ 8.52: #define RAND_MAX 32767

This makes seemingly innocuous code like the below become non-portable and blow up due to signed to unsigned promotion:

    cos(w * t) + (rand() - RAND_MAX / 2) * 0.1 / (RAND_MAX / 2);

`rand()` returns a `signed int` in the range [0,`RAND_MAX`].

If `RAND_MAX` is defined as an `unsigned int`, the value from `rand()` gets promoted to `unsigned int` too.

And if that's the case, the difference `(rand() - RAND_MAX / 2)` becomes an unsigned difference of unsigned integers with the value in the ranges [0,`RAND_MAX`-`RAND_MAX`/2] & [`UINT_MAX`+1-`RAND_MAX`/2,`UINT_MAX`-1] instead of being a signed difference of signed integers with the value in the range [-`RAND_MAX`/2,`RAND_MAX`-`RAND_MAX`/2].

It can multiply a 10,000 digit integer by another. The problem I am having is after a certain amount of multiplications (for me its after about 3 large multiplications or 25 small and 3 large) My program freezes. It uses about 1.8 GB of RAM and then the stops. I'm not quite sure what is causing this, I know that different numbers have the same result.

The second version should be faster. The passed array needs to be one element larger than in the previous case. Say for an array with 5 values, you allocate six ints and then do the following

    int FindWithBlock(int * Arr, int LastCellIndex, int Val)

this version should be faster - you don't need to check array boundaries with each iteration through Arr. 

Now the ""issue"". When running these functions 100K times on an array of 100K elements in Debug, the second version is roughly 2x faster. In Release however, the first version is approximately 6000x faster. And the question is why.

If I substitute the array variable with a regular double variable and inside the previously mentioned while loop print the value of this variable it gets printed correctly. What is wrong with the mentioned code? I tried initializing all values in the array beforehand, but, of course, that was no help either.

As the items come off the belt, they are loaded onto delivery trucks. All trucks are the same and they can carry items up to a specific maximum weight (called the capacity of the truck). Items are numbered from 1 and are of various weights.
The items must be loaded sequentially onto the trucks, i.e., items 1 to N (for some N) go on the first truck, items N+1, …, M (for some M) go on the second truck, and so on. Not all trucks will be loaded to their full capacity, of course, but it is guaranteed that no single item is too heavy for a truck.
We can load the trucks in a greedy manner (load as many items as you can on this truck and when the next item does not fit, start a new truck) but this may lead to an unbalanced distribution of the items among the trucks.

Define the spare capacity of the convoy as the sum of squares of the unused capacity of each truck in the convoy. We want to load the trucks in such a way to minimize the spare capacity of the convoy.

Given the capacity, c, of the trucks and sequence of weights of the items, how many items should each truck carry, and how many trucks are required? 

The first line of data gives the value of c and the number of items, n (<= 1000). Subsequent lines contain n values, the weights of the items, in order. Some sample data are:

but it actually pass the pointer value to it as the parameter, and the code works.

Each of these can be written with a straight-line code (loops and conditionals are not necessary)
Example of one I have done: 
// this returns 0 if x==y and 1 otherwise
Int isNotEqual (int x, int y) {
return !(x ^ y)
}

My questions to you:
Extract byte n from word x using any of the following operations: ! ~ & ^ | + << >>

Set all bits of results to least significant bit of x using any of the following operations: ! ~ & ^ | + << >>

Shift x to the right by n using a logical shift (working on 32 bit machine) using any of the following operations: ~ & ^ | + << >>

Return count of number of 1s in word using any of the following operations: ! ~ & ^ | + << >>

Compute !x without using ! Using any of the following operations:! ~ & ^ | + << >>

Return a mask that marks the position of the least significant 1 bit using any of the following operations: ! ~ & ^ | + << >>

    ...
    if (fscanf(stream,""%d "",&x))
    if else (fscanf(stream,""%d:%g"",&y,&z))
    ...

Is there a way to tell scanf to only read a character if it is followed by a space?

Probably a trivial question, but I've got a feeling that I'm missing something.

I need to implement this function:

    time_t get_local_midnight_timestamp(time_t ts);

That is, we get arbitrary timestamp (from the last year, for example), and return it rounded up to the midnight of the same day.

The problem is that the function must be aware of DST switches and DST rules changes (like DST cancellation and/or extension).

(The reason I need this that I need to implement look up into some older statistics data.)

As far as I understand, naïve approach with zeroing out `struct tm` time fields would not work — precisely because of DST stuff (looks like in DST-change day there are two local midnight time_t timestamps).

Please point me in the right direction...

However, I'm receiving some weird behavior in my implementation of an addLast function. It seems that the added element doesn't appear until my next call to addLast.

        }

      printf("")"");
    }

Problematic code:

    //Adds an element at the tail of the list
    void addLast(linkedlist *list, ListElement forAdding){
      linkedlist *node = list;
      linkedlist *NewNode = (linkedlist *) malloc(sizeof(linkedlist));
      
      //Go to the last element in the list

      //Prepare the node we will add
      NewNode->data = forAdding;
      NewNode->next = NULL;
      
      //Since node is pointing to the tail element, set its
      //next to the NewNode---the new tail
      node->next = NewNode;
    }
        
    //Special attention to this function!
    void List(ListElement items[], linkedlist *list, int numItems){
      int i = 0;
	
      while(i < numItems){
        addLast(list, items[i]);
        printf(""Before "");

        displayList(list);
        printf(""\n"");
        i++;
      }
    }

Main function:

    int main(){
      linkedlist *l= (linkedlist *) malloc(sizeof(linkedlist));
      CreateList(l, 0);
      int a_list[5] = {1, 2, 3, 5, 6};
      List(a_list, l, sizeof(a_list)/sizeof(a_list[0]));
      printf(""A list of five elements: %d"", sizeof(a_list)/sizeof(a_list[0]));
      displayList(l);
      removeLast(l);
      addLast(l, 7);
      printf(""\nAdded something at last position: "");

      printf(""\n"");
    }

For which I get the output:

    Before (0)

    A list of five elements: 5(0 1 2 3 5)
    Added something at last position: (0 1 2 3 5 6)

As you see, it seems that the item added will only appear on my next call to addLast.

I've so far figured out that it is _actually_ there though for some reason it won't get printed. If, for instance, I do another `addLast(list, 6);` call just before I close function List (but outside the loop, of course!), the output line `Added something at last position...` (which happens after a call to `addLast(l, 7);` will actually display `Added something at last position: (0 1 2 3 5 6 6)`.

So, what am I doing wrong?

      linkedlist *node = list;
      linkedlist *NewNode = (linkedlist *) malloc(sizeof(linkedlist));
      
      //Go to the last element in the list

        node = node->next;

    //Special attention to this function!
    void List(ListElement items[], linkedlist *list, int numItems){
      int i = 0;
	
      while(i < numItems){
        addLast(list, items[i]);
        printf(""Before "");
        displayList(list);
        printf(""\n"");
        printf(""Added %d"", items[i]);
        displayList(list);
        printf(""\n"");
        i++;
      }
    }

Main function:

    int main(){
      linkedlist *l= (linkedlist *) malloc(sizeof(linkedlist));
      CreateList(l, 0);
      int a_list[5] = {1, 2, 3, 5, 6};
      List(a_list, l, sizeof(a_list)/sizeof(a_list[0]));
      printf(""A list of five elements: %d"", sizeof(a_list)/sizeof(a_list[0]));
      displayList(l);
      removeLast(l);
      addLast(l, 7);
      printf(""\nAdded something at last position: "");
      displayList(l);
      printf(""\n"");
    }

For which I get the output:

    Before (0)
    Added 1(0)
    Before (0)
    Added 2(0 1)
    Before (0 1)
    Added 3(0 1 2)
    Before (0 1 2)
    Added 5(0 1 2 3)
    Before (0 1 2 3)
    Added 6(0 1 2 3 5)
    A list of five elements: 5(0 1 2 3 5)
    Added something at last position: (0 1 2 3 5 6)

As you see, it seems that the item added will only appear on my next call to addLast.

I've so far figured out that it is _actually_ there though for some reason it won't get printed. If, for instance, I do another `addLast(list, 6);` call just before I close function List (but outside the loop, of course!), the output line `Added something at last position...` (which happens after a call to `addLast(l, 7);` will actually display `Added something at last position: (0 1 2 3 5 6 6)`.

So, what am I doing wrong?
