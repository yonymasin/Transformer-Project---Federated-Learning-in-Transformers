I do want the app to work if there is no data connection at the time also, so I need to save everything locally on the phone too. The app can then sync with the server when it gets a connection.

This brings up a little issue. I'm used to saving everything on the server and then getting the records back with id's generated from the server for them. If there is no connection, the app will save locally to the phone but not the server. When syncing with the server, I don't see a way for the phone to know when a record comes back which locally record it's associated with. There isn't enough unique data to figure this out.

What is the best way to handle this?

One way I've been thinking is to change the id of the records to a GUID and let the phone set the id. This way, all records will have an id locally, and when saving to the server, it should still be a unique id.

Bigger green circle shows accuracy area. Its size in pixels varies depending on zoom. If zoom level is big - it becomes rather big (> 480 pixels). At that point it gets cropped by screen resolution. AFAIK WP7 restriction is 2000x2000 px for control size.

Seems that this is a kind of a map control restriction.

I have an app that displays a user control which is a little graphically heavy. When the user swipes it, it transitions in a push-left type of transition to bring in a new user control which is also a little graphically heavy. If the user swipes the other way, control #1 is brought in in the same type of push-transition, this time from the right. What I do today is take a snapshot of #1, load #2 off screen and take a snapshot of it, put both side-by-side in a Canvas control and animate that control either left or right. One of the reasons I don't just use the controls and animae them is they may have animation that starts when they are loaded - my current technique allows me to capture a screen shot of pre-animation and post-animation, depending on which direction they go it.

What I'm wondering, however, if it would be better/faster to just do the above the first time and send the writeablebitmap to IsolatedStorage with `Extenstions.SaveJPEG` and just use that instead in subsequent tranistion animations.

If the user swipes the other way, control #1 is brought in in the same type of push-transition, this time from the right. What I do today is take a snapshot of #1, load #2 off screen and take a snapshot of it, put both side-by-side in a Canvas control and animate that control either left or right. One of the reasons I don't just use the controls and animae them is they may have animation that starts when they are loaded - my current technique allows me to capture a screen shot of pre-animation and post-animation, depending on which direction they go it.

What I'm wondering, however, if it would be better/faster to just do the above the first time and send the writeablebitmap to IsolatedStorage with `Extenstions.SaveJPEG` and just use that instead in subsequent tranistion animations.

Would load/render/writeablebitmap each time generally be faster or load jpeg be faster each time?",3

I need this event in particular cause I need PivotItem and it's data context for further operations.
Is there something I am doing wrong, or is there some other event that I can use here while getting a PivotItem ( PivotItemEventArgs ).

First code takes 402 By, the second is more than 2x smaller - 182 By. (If you wanted to properly format it, it would be stil 2x smaller.)

Here is a more practical example: I took the toolkit generic.xaml and tested how much can be this file sqeezed within 10 minutes.

Xaml code is included 1:1 into the binary toolkit dll. It means it must be parsed at run-time.

Why to hell must every WP7 user again and again wait for parsing of meaningless white space? Just because of stupid formatting MS programmers use.

If these programmers read another [MS article][1] they would understand the amount of unnecessary work caused by inapropriate formatting. Plus there are articles on the web that prove that xml white-space parsing has non-negligible impact.

Sorry, had to write this as I daily see inefficient programming on the MS side. But nobody cares, so I decided to pick up a tiny water-proof example.
