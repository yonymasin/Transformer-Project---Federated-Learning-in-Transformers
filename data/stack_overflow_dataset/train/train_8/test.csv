I'm aware that Microsoft mandates a rigid [base specification][1] for WP7 handsets. I've also developed for many other mobile platforms and realise that choosing a latest, top-of-the-range handset won't be representative of the market as a whole.

The kind of things I'm after (maybe shaped by my experience with Android) are:

 1. How do different handsets deal with new firmware updates? Is it manufacturer-specific?
 2. Do all handsets use Zune software to connect to a PC or do some manufacturers require you to use their own software?
 3. Are there any features not included in Microsoft's base spec that other developers would recommend as worth having for general purpose development?

Currently I'm considering an [HTC Radar][2] as they're available in the UK for half the price of a [Lumia 800][3]. As a *developer* (rather than a user) would I notice any significant differences between the two?
