From 0-10296 are the Sphere's Vertices.
From 10297-30888 are the Sphere's Normal Vertices.

Here is my Vertex file:
 

       
    precision highp float;
    
    in vec3 in_Position; //declare position
    in vec3 in_Color;

    void main(void) {
    
    // Multiply the mvp matrix by the vertex to obtain our final vertex position (mvp was created in *.cpp)
    
    gl_Position = mvpmatrix * vec4(in_Position, 1.0);
    
    ex_Color = in_Color;
    
    }

and my Fragment file

    #version 330
    precision highp float;
    
    in vec3 ex_Color;
    out vec4 gl_FragColor;
    
    void main(void) {
    
    gl_FragColor = vec4(ex_Color,1.0);
    
    }


Now I know that I need to pass the normals to the vertice and fragment shader, but how do I do that and how/where do I implement the light calculations, linear interpolation??
Thanks

 1. I have modeled a pseudo magnetic field in OpenGL, which looks similar to this ![BarMagnet Simulation][1] 
 2. The vectors are discretely calculated by retrieving appropriate values from a data base which has the Bx, By values of a magnet (modeled in FEMM).
 3. Now the question is how can I calculate the force of magnet A on magnet B and vice versa?? (Appreciate if some idea on Torque also is given)..

I have got all the values like, cross section of the magnets, the separation b/w the magnets, the angle difference between the two magnets, (Bx, By) at any point etc.

Google dint help me. So, posting here.. Pls do help me..

Here's the vertex shader:

    uniform mat4 projection;
    uniform mat4 view;
    uniform mat4 model;
    
    void main(void)
    {
    	gl_Position = projection * view * model * gl_Vertex;
    	gl_TexCoord[0] = gl_MultiTexCoord0;
    }

My understanding is that using various transformations, the model space is eventually turned to clip space, which is a box bound by each unit in each axis drawn directly to the viewport, i.e. something at (-1, 1,0) is at the top left of the viewport. When I remove all matrix transforms from the shader,

    gl_Position = gl_Vertex;

and pass in, as the model, a simple quad

    public Vector3[] verts = new Vector3[] {
        new Vector3(-1f, -1f, 0),
        new Vector3(1f, -1f, 0),
        new Vector3(1f, 1f, 0),
        new Vector3(-1f, 1f, 0),

    };

    public uint[] indices = new uint[] {
        0,1,2,
        0,2,3,
    };

I get the expected full screen image. When I apply the transformations, the image appears as
a small square in the centre of the screen, as you'd expect. The problem arises when I try to calculate the position of a vertex of the model in clip coordinates on the CPU:

    Matrix4 test = (GlobalDrawer.projectionMatrix * GlobalDrawer.viewMatrix) * modelMatrix;
    
    Vector4 testv = new Vector4(1f, 1f, 0, 1);
    Console.WriteLine(""Test Output: "" + Vector4.Transform(testv, test));

(The matrices passed in are identical to the ones passed to the shader)

The program then proceeds to give output outside of clip space:

    Test Output: (0.9053301, 1.207107, -2.031746, 0)

So, the question is why; what am I doing wrong?

If you can make out the white dotted lines they are the direction the lights are looking. the surface of the podium is lit and the sides of the podium are lit as it spins.

Supposedly the code for this compiles cleanly on my system (Ubuntu 8.0.4.2). So I am probably missing some dependency but I have no idea which. I am using gcc-4.1 and automake1.9 (required according to the README).

(because it took me a long time to get it right)

OK so if your doing any sort of openGL or DirectX or something that requires rotating an object in 3D, you will come across a problem where you cant rotate an object properly. what i mean by properly is that when the object rotates, the axes seem to rotate with it, and your rotation looks odd/is wrong.

since ive been doing iphone development, im going to show you this in opengl and objective c.

step1: create an Up, Front and Right vector for your object, these will point to the front, right and upward direction of your object, so initialise them like so

    self.right = GLKVector3Make(1, 0, 0);
    self.up = GLKVector3Make(0, 1, 0);
    self.front = GLKVector3Make(0, 0, 1);

step 2: setup some methods to do rotations on these vectors, you would need 3 methods like this to do each axis, this is just the X axis.

    - (void) rotateXInDegrees:(float)rot{
    
        GLKMatrix3 temp = GLKMatrix3MakeRotation(GLKMathDegreesToRadians(rot), 1, 0, 0);
    
        self.right = GLKMatrix3MultiplyVector3(temp, self.right);
        self.up = GLKMatrix3MultiplyVector3(temp, self.up);
        self.front = GLKMatrix3MultiplyVector3(temp, self.front);
    }

step 3: here is the elegant part, in your update method basically copy paste this matrix (in the code its flipped to what it actually is in mathematical terms, but thats how the parameters for this matrix function are set out)

    mvm = GLKMatrix4Make(self.right.x,      self.right.y,       self.right.z,    0,
                         self.up.x,         self.up.y,          self.up.z,       0,
                         self.front.x,      self.front.y,       self.front.z,    0,
                         self.position.x,   self.position.y,    self.position.z, 1);

you can leave out the position vector in that matrix if you dont plan on moving the object, just replace it with 0's. the reason for this matrix is explained here: http://www.songho.ca/opengl/gl_anglestoaxes.html

this matrix will orient your object according to the vectors you have setup and throw in a translation for free!

step4: multiply this matrix with you modelview matrix in your draw function

    self.effect.transform.modelviewMatrix = GLKMatrix4Multiply(self.modelViewMatrix, mvm);

here mvm is your objects modelViewMatrix and self.modelViewMatrix is your global (or camera) modelViewMatrix

It's good for graphics applications but it is not acceptable for computer games.

I know many users using Windows XP and if the user does not install the video card driver for his GPU then the OpenGL won't be hardware accelerated (while DirectX is or if not it will throw errors).

Is there a better (and possibly cross platform) way to determine if OpenGL uses the hardware acceleration than measuring the FPS and if it's too low notify the user?

To illustrate what I mean, see this image:

![traveling sine wave][1]


Because I want to work with many objects, I decided to use vertex buffer objects in order to minimize the amount of `gl*` calls. My current code looks something like this:

A) setup initial vertices:

    # calculate sin(x) in range [0, n]
    data = sin(x)
    
    # create & bind buffer
    vbo_id = GLuint()
    glGenBuffers(1, vbo_id);
    glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, vbo_id)
    
    # allocate memory & transfer data to GPU
    glBufferData(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, sizeof(data), data, GL_DYNAMIC_DRAW)
    

B) update vertices:

    draw():
    
      # calc new data and update offset
      data = calc new values sin([n+dx, n+2*dx])
      # update offset 'n'
      n = n+2*dx

      # upload data 
      glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, vbo_id)
      glBufferSubData(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, offset, sizeof(data), data)
    
      # translate scene so it looks like sine wave has moved
      glTranslatef(-local_shift, 0.0, 0.0)
    
      # draw all points from offset
      glVertexPointer(2, GL_FLOAT, 0, offset)
      glDrawArrays(GL_LINE_STRIP, 0, points_per_vbo)



This works just fine, however if I have let's say 20 of those sine waves that span the entire screen, then things slow down considerably. 
**Therefore my questions:**


1) should I use glMapBuffer to bind the buffer on the GPU and fill the data directly (instead of using glBufferSubData)? Or will this make no difference performance wise?

2) should I use a shader for moving objects (here line strip) instead of calling glTranslatef? If so, how would such a shader look like?

3) what happens if the window get's resized? how do I keep aspect ratio and scale vertices accordingly? glViewport() only helps scaling in y direction, not in x direction. If the window is rescaled in x-direction, then in my current implementation I would have to recalculate the position of the entire line strip and upload it to the GPU. I guess this could be done with a shader instead too?

4) I noticed that when I use `glTranslatef` with a non integral value, the screen starts to flicker if the line strip consists of thousands of points. This is most probably because the fine resolution that I use to calculate the line strip does not match the pixel resolution of the screen and therefore sometimes some points appear in front and sometimes behind other points (this is particularly annoying when you don't render a sine wave but some 'random' data). How can I prevent this from happening (besides the obvious solution of translating by a integer multiple of 1 pixel)? If a window get re-sized from let's say originally 800x800 pixels to 100x100 pixels and I still want to visualize a line strip of 20 seconds, then shifting in x direction must work flicker free somehow with sub pixel precision, right?

If i comment the ***glGetUniform(Location)*** part out and if use the float as a ***const*** instead of a ***uniform*** then my shader works fine. But i want to be able to change the value in my shader in each render. I though i had to use a uniform for that...?

Before I render the texture to the pane I set the current color to white since this influences the brightness of the texture, so I guess a transparent texture would be an explanation... but why three different effects?!?

I want to capture a frame, use that data as an input image (`Image2D`) to a OpenCL Kernel. The Kernel should manipulate the data and write it to an `Image2DGL`, which is an image object with an attached OpenGL texture. Basically it looks like that:


	 _______________	  RGB		 _______________
	|				|    uint8*		|				|	CL_RGBA / CL_UNORM_INT8
	|   Grabber 	| ------------> |   Image2D		| -------------------------.

									|_______________|
	Internal
	Format: GL_RGBA
	Format: GL_RGBA
	Type: ?

I'm initializing the texture like that:

    GLuint tex = 0;

    void initTexture( int width, int height )
    {
    	glGenTextures(1, &tex);
    	glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_RECTANGLE, tex);
    // now here is where I need assistance: The type parameter of the Texture (GL_FLOAT)
    	glTexImage2D(GL_TEXTURE_RECTANGLE, 0, GL_RGBA, width, height, 0, GL_RGBA, GL_FLOAT, NULL );
    } 

Then I create the shared image (`Image2DGL`):

    texMems.push_back(Image2DGL(clw->context, CL_MEM_READ_WRITE, GL_TEXTURE_RECTANGLE, 0, tex, &err));

Then I create the source image (input image): 

    ImageFormat format;
    format.image_channel_data_type = CL_UNORM_INT8;
    format.image_channel_order = CL_RGBA;
    srcImgBuffer = Image2D(clw->context, CL_MEM_READ_WRITE, format, width, height, 0, NULL, &err);

In every render loop I'm writing the data into the `srcImgBuffer`:

    // write the frame to the image buffer
    clw->queue.enqueueWriteImage(srcImgBuffer, CL_TRUE, origin, region, 0, 0, (void*)data, NULL, NULL);

Also I'm setting the arguments for the kernel:

    tex_kernel.setArg(0, texMems[0]);
    tex_kernel.setArg(1, srcImgBuffer);
    tex_kernel.setArg(2, width);
    tex_kernel.setArg(3, height);

Before and after I do acquire and release the GL objects. The testing kernel looks like that:

    __kernel void init_texture_kernel(__write_only image2d_t out, __read_only image2d_t in, int w, int h)
    {
    	const sampler_t smp = CLK_NORMALIZED_COORDS_FALSE | CLK_ADDRESS_CLAMP | CLK_FILTER_NEAREST;
    
    	int2 coords = { get_global_id(0), get_global_id(1) };
    	float4 pixel = read_imagef(in, smp, coords);
    	float4 test = { (float)coords.x/(float)w , 0, 0, 1};
    	write_imagef( out, coords, pixel );
    }

The `image_channel_data_type` can be read as float in the kernel and is interpreted as normalized value. The output image looks not right, I've got a sliced picture (linewise), obviously because of the wrong data interpretation. As I mentioned I assume the error is within the initialization of the texture's type. I tried GL_FLOAT (as I'm writing as float to the image in the kernel).

![Results: Image as PPM dump from the decoder (left), Texture output scattered (right)][1]

The left one is a `PPM` out of the decoder, the right one is what I'm getting back on my output texture.

1) I downloaded, compiled and successfully ran an OpenGL shader program from the sample code in *OpenGL A Primer 3rd Edition* located [here][1]. However, some of the other code samples from that same chapter which implement other OpenGL shaders don't run.

This would seem to indicate that I'm running OpenGL 1.5, but the Mesa version (which as I understand it is a software implementation of OpenGL 2.0.

    $ ./version
    OpenGL Version major=1, minor=5
    GLSL Version major=0, minor=0

This doesn't say anything about Mesa, and would lead me to believe I'm running OpenGL 1.5. Please help me understand what version I'm running, so I can know if I need to run out to the store and buy a new graphics card before I can be confident shaders will run. Thank you!

    #include <GL/glut.h>

This year I am planning to alter / update the course a little bit. I've been researching in various libraries and frameworks to use for the practical exercises. Based on my experience, students have very good knowledge in languages such as C#, Java and have had many problems with C++ in the past. Due to that, I had to loose time teaching basics of C/C++ for them to catch up. 

The mathematical and theoretical background of the course will not change. They will still learn about CG concepts such as transformations, matrices, cameras, textures, shading, ray-tracing algorithms etc. 

So, my question is: Do you have any experience with other frameworks?

My primary candidate right now is Microsofts XNA, even though I am trying to avoid MS stack, based on my experience my students prefer to use C# for their projects.

I've also looked into Java3D and Qt. I am not sure whether Java3D is still being developed, and I can hardly find any good textbook for that. On the other hand, Qt might be to large of a framework for the basic tasks required by students.

I have also, for debugging purposes, commented out chunks of my drawing code, and nothing seems to be breaking the lighting - and of course, I wrote all that and tested it before lighting the scene anyway, so I see no reason it should be wrong.

Please request any additional information that could help you help me. And in the end if I simply can't get an answer, I'll probably have to break down and write a test case where I can just post the entire rendering code here and demonstrate the problem.

[Here is a really bad animated gif I tried to make...][1] But it kinda shows what I'm talking about, as far as the light being sporadic. The lit frames are what it's supposed to look like. Also it's not so much flickering when I slow it down to 5fps, more just kinda randomly on or off. I don't get it...
