 1. Is COP and the ""Camera"" the same thing? Which in turn refers to the ""User"" looking at the screen?
 2. Can someone please explain to me the relation between the Projection Perspective and the Viewport if there is one? Because at the moment to me they seem to be the same thing. Or is the PP the Window which is then scaled to fit the viewport?
 3. In OpenGL when setting up gluPerspective the zNear value is the distance of the Camera from the Projection Perspective so the combination of the fovy and zNear defines the size of the Window (assuming that the Window == the Projection Perspective and I undestand something :/ ) into the World.
 4. When creating a window (only using gl and glu), after you have initalized everything you enter while(!quit) loop that has a render function(this is question is a bit silly), does everything in all case get drawn in this render function which has glBegin() and glEnd(). Lets assume I have a biggish world with lots of features and so on. Does everything that needs to get drawn fit in between those functions such that this Render function can in time become really large?

Sorry I know these questions are really naive but they are a few things that I'm having a bit of trouble understanding.

I have this program (which is quite unorganized) that compiles with no errors and gives me the typical blank screen that so many manage to achieve.

I've tried stepping through it from the main to the bottom over and over but I'm amiss.


I am now hoping someone experienced in OpenGL and SDL (although I suspect the problem is just to do with OpenGL) could browse through the code and hopefully the problem would jump out immediately.

Thank you for taking your time to help me in advance.

Instead of rendering to the screen, i am somehow able to force the application to render to a framebuffer object instead of rendering to the screen ( messing with glew or intercepting a call in a dll ).

Once the application has rendered its content to the FBO is it possible to apply a shader to the contents of the FB? My knowledge is limited here, so from what i understand at this stage all information about vertices is no longer available and all the necessary tests have been applied, so whats left in the buffer is just pixel data. Is this correct?

If it is possible to apply a shader to the FBO, is is possible to get a fisheye affect? ( like this for example: http://idea.hosting.lv/a/gfx/quakeshots.html )

The technique used in the linke above is to create 6 different viewports and render each viewport to a cubemap face and then apply the texture to a mesh.
