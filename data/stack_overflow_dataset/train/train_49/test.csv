According to the GAE Log, the called URI (in this example svnr=1234, other fields are blank - but even if all fields are non-null, it isn't working) is `/query/?name=&gdat=&svnr=1234` which seems to be correct, but the Server's response (in `writer.toString()`) is the Default Route's `StandardResource.represent()` String, so I guess the issue is that Router does not match the calling URI to the PatientResource - what am I doing wrong?

There are no errors/warnings in the GAE log/android logcat except for a EOFException resulting from jackson not being able to deserialize the result string. The other route (""/save"") is working fine.

I've heard of GAE and even though it doesn't support PHP, people have gotten around this limitation by using Quercus I think (I haven't tried it, but supposedly it works). But what factors should I consider when evaluating whether it's a match for me? For example, what made you **not** go with GAE? Or if you went with it, what are you not happy about?

Is it caching them or something?,"I've noticed google app engine's development server handling cookies very strangely.  Basically, they don't seem to go away when they should.  Hopefully somebody else knows what's going on and can enlighten me.  Here's a rough outline of the steps to reproduce.  

First, create three RequestHandlers: setcookie, deletecookie and displaycookie and give them paths that match (e.g. http://localhost:8080/setcookie/).  Then do the following:

1) Hit setcookie  
2) Hit displaycookie (it prints, right?)  
3) Hit deletecookie  
4) Close your browser  
5) Open your browser and go to displaycookie (uh oh... it prints)  
6) Check if the cookie really exists using FF's developer toolbar or somesuch (no cookie!)  
7) Open a *different* browser and go to displaycookie (whoa, it prints!)   
8) Restart app engine  
9) Hit displaycookie (finally, it's gone)  

So, what gives?  The only thing I can think of is that the development server is doing some sort of caching.  A quick google search yields a couple of other people who have had the same issue, but there haven't been any good responses so I figured I'd bring it here.
 
I realize that my explanation is long winded and may be unclear. I'm open to suggestions for how to improve it, so please let me know if you have any.

I have read a lot on blogs and questions similar to this but still couldnt find any clear answer. Let me explain my situation. 

 - I bought a domain (lets say mydomain.com) from www.namecheap.com (surprisingly i got same
   domain name which was once registered with godaddy but it got expired
   and i never bothered to renew it) .
 - I have my blog hosted on google app engine lets call it
   blog.appspot.com 
 - I have registered my domain with google apps and added my appengine app
   and gave a URL to it let call that blog.mydomain.com. 


So my question is once you have all this setup what is the process to point 
blog.appspot.com --> blog.mydomain.com 

I am looking for DNS , A record, CNAME and MXRecord settings on Domain Provider side( which is namecheap.com in my case) .. also what is the nameserver settings?
