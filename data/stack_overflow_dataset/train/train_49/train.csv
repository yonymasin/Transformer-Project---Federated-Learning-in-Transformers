Once I have a workable solution, I'll open the stuff out on google code as I see lots of people struggling with this.

The goal: create a simple but powerful paging solution for GAE, with the following features:

 - forward and backward paging, support for first page and last page
 - sorting by (a subset) of fields (one order only at a time)
 - having a filtering criteria in a like fashion (e.g. typing 'Tom' will filter and only display persons with name starting 'Tom')
 - keep track of total number of pages

Design decissions:
 
 - do NOT use limit/offset as it doesn't scale. Instead rely on cursors
 - use sharding to keep the total number of pages updated
 - accept compromises, but aim for the best performance/scalability

The obstacle (i.e. last bastion):
I feel the only problem left is when I have a filtering criteria (e.g. name begins with 'Tom') and a sorting criteria on a different property.

e.g. Person [name, age]

 - Filter by name 'Tom*'
 - Sort by age

Reading through the documentation, I thought I've found the solution:

    Query q = new Query(""Person"");
    q.addFilter(""name"", FilterOperator.GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL, nameFilter);
    q.addFilter(""name"", FilterOperator.LESS_THEN, nameFilter + ""\uFFFD"");
    q.addSort(""name"", SortDirection.ASCENDING);
    q.addSort(""age"", SortDirection.ASCENDING);

I thought this would return:

 - Tom2 18
 - Tom1 20

Unfortunately, this returns

 - Tom1 20
 - Tom2 18

as the query is first filtered by name, then by age as a secondary key.

The only solution I can think of is to put the whole filter result into a Java structure, sort by using a comparator and then pick the records I want to display. But this has an additional problem that my cursor logic disappears. Which then kinda means I have 2 logical paths for solving paging. Which might be the ultimate solution, but I wonder if anyone smarter has a better idea.

Any ideas welcome.

Thanks,
Matyas

The obstacle (i.e. last bastion):
I feel the only problem left is when I have a filtering criteria (e.g. name begins with 'Tom') and a sorting criteria on a different property.

e.g. Person [name, age]

 - Filter by name 'Tom*'
 - Sort by age

Reading through the documentation, I thought I've found the solution:

    Query q = new Query(""Person"");
    q.addFilter(""name"", FilterOperator.GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL, nameFilter);
    q.addFilter(""name"", FilterOperator.LESS_THEN, nameFilter + ""\uFFFD"");
    q.addSort(""name"", SortDirection.ASCENDING);
    q.addSort(""age"", SortDirection.ASCENDING);

I thought this would return:

 - Tom2 18
 - Tom1 20

Unfortunately, this returns

 - Tom1 20
 - Tom2 18

as the query is first filtered by name, then by age as a secondary key.

The only solution I can think of is to put the whole filter result into a Java structure, sort by using a comparator and then pick the records I want to display. But this has an additional problem that my cursor logic disappears. Which then kinda means I have 2 logical paths for solving paging. Which might be the ultimate solution, but I wonder if anyone smarter has a better idea.

Any ideas welcome.

Thanks,
Matyas

This solution, while simple, negates the benefit of the MessageIndex. Additionally since the the MessageIndex is in the same entity group as the message datastore writes will be limited.

I'd like to model a cheap friend relationship system. Each user can have max 50 friends. I am thinking of doing something zany like:

    class User {
        String username;
        Text friends; // ""joe,mary,frank,pete""
    }

Where ""friends"" is a comma delimited list of usernames that the user is friends with. Here are the operations I want to support and how I'd do them with the above:


----------

**Fetch my full friend list**
    
Just look up the User object, return back the comma delimited list of friends.

----------

**Add a friend**

Fetch my user object, check if the target name exists in the string, if not, append to the end. Persist modified User object back to data store.

----------

**Delete a friend**

Fetch my user object, check if the target name exists in the string, if it does, delete it from the string. Persist modified User object back to data store.

----------

**Are two users mutual friends**

Fetch both user objects, check that the usernames appear on one another's user object.

----------

Getting a full list of friends is pretty important for my application, and storing each relationship as a separate entity seems nightmarish to me (fetching each entity from the datastore when a user needs to see their friends list would probably bankrupt me). I am hoping that a simple read from the Text attribute would be much more lightweight. 

Checking for the mutual friend scenario seems like the biggest drawback here, but won't happen that often. I don't know if fetching the two User objects from the datastore and doing the string comparisons would be disastrous performance-wise. Might be ok? I think I may have also read that creating and deleting objects from the data store costs more than just modifying an existing object. So the add/delete friend operations might be better this way too.

Would be happy to hear any thoughts on this or more optimal ways of going about it.

I have a sample web app client (ckclient) that accesses a REST API (commitapi) for managing their commitments.  This follows the model of having an app like LinkedIn displaying a user's Tweets (via Twitter) as described in: http://www.slideshare.net/coldfumonkeh/oauth-demystified-hopefully

In my simple app, a user goes to the web app client and asks to see their commitments.  I am using Restlet and the user is redirected to a page where they can choose their OpenId provider and login.   They are they redirected to a page where they can approve access to their commitment resources.  Everything works fine.  

But, the web app client doesn't know who the user is!   All the authentication is done with the REST API, not with the web app client.  

So my first question is... is this a bug or a feature?  

My guess at the answer is that this is a ""feature"" - that is the way Oauth works - you don't WANT the web app client to know the userid/email address stored with the resource server (commitkeeper in my case, Twitter in the slideshare above).  

If that is correct, then if I want the web app client to know who the user is, the web app client should provide user authentication.  Since I am using Google's UserService on the server side, I also implemented UserService based authentication on the web app client.  And now, if the user also does the web app client authentication, then the web app client has the identity of the user.  So that is all good.  

Combining these two also works - but I can't quite understand why.

1. On the web app, I login through Google's userService (technically with a GaeAuthenticator, that only uses Google accounts).  Now the web app knows who I am and can display my email address.
2. From the web app, I ask the server for my commitments.  The server responds by giving me the login page where I can pick my OpenId provider.

2a. If I pick Google, the UserService seems to know that I have already logged in through the web app and shows me my commitments.

2b. If I pick Yahoo (or something else), I have to authenticate with Yahoo and then I am shown the commitments for that Yahoo user.
This all seems fine to me - except for how does the UserService know that I already logged in?  The webclient is at x.appspot.com and the server is at y.appspot.com.  Is the answer as simple as the UserService is integrated across all of appspot.com?  

In any case, thanks to anyone who can answer these two questions - or just confirm that I am on the right path.

Runtime MCycles, and Avg Latency. 
The help provided seems to be outdated, here what it states:

The current load table provides two data points for CPU usage, ""Avg CPU (API)"" and ""% CPU"". The ""Avg CPU (API)"" displays the average amount of CPU a request to that URI has consumed over the past hour, measured in megacycles. The ""% CPU"" column shows the percentage of CPU that URI has consumed since midnight PST with respect to the other URIs in your application.

1). So I assume Runtime MCycles is what the help calls Avg CPU (API)?

How do I map this number to the request stats in the logs?
For example one of the requests has this kind of logs: ms=583 cpu_ms=519 api_cpu_ms=402.

2). Do I understand correctly that ms includes cpu_ms and cpu_ms includes api_cpu_ms?

3). So then cpu_ms is the Runtime MCycles which is shown as average for the given URI on dashboard?

4) I have a F1 instance with 600Mhz and concurrency enabled for my app. Does it mean this instance throughput it 600 MCycles per second? So if average request takes 100 Mcycles, it should handle 5-6 request on average?

The reason I'm digging into this is of course trying to predict the costs for my app under load.

1). So I assume Runtime MCycles is what the help calls Avg CPU (API)?

How do I map this number to the request stats in the logs?
For example one of the requests has this kind of logs: ms=583 cpu_ms=519 api_cpu_ms=402.

2). Do I understand correctly that ms includes cpu_ms and cpu_ms includes api_cpu_ms?

3). So then cpu_ms is the Runtime MCycles which is shown as average for the given URI on dashboard?

4) I have a F1 instance with 600Mhz and concurrency enabled for my app. Does it mean this instance throughput it 600 MCycles per second? So if average request takes 100 Mcycles, it should handle 5-6 request on average?

The reason I'm digging into this is of course trying to predict the costs for my app under load.

I'd like to set up a system that notifies team members whenever an app version is made the default version on Google App Engine's admin console. The reason is to keep all developers updated when a version is changed to default. And this notification should not be suppressable by developers to ensure that no notifications are missed.

When I asked Google support about any such notification, they said none existed and added a suggestion to feature request #4260111 to provide a monitoring API.

In Google App Engine's admin console for a particular application, there is a section called Admin Logs. The Admin Logs can be filtered by event ""Verson Made Default"" to get log lines for every time an app version has been made the default version in production. These logs cannot be suppressed, which is good for my purpose.

Here is what a log line looks like. 

<pre>
Date                  Administrator      Event                      Result
2012-06-14 12:30:51   a@example.com      Set the default version    version=123.timestamp
</pre>

The URL these logs lines are available at has the form:

    http://appengine.google.com/adminlogs?app_id=s%7Esome_app_id&type=version_made_default&limit=20

A response to a similar question on SO indicates that currently the only solution now is scrape the page at the URL above. Reference: http://stackoverflow.com/a/8084798/888759

**Question:**

To view the admin logs at the URL above, the admin has to be logged in. How can I scrape this page behind a Google App Engine admin console login wall?

To reproduce:

Create a new GWT and AppEngine project (I called the package ""test2""
below)

Add the following to GreetingServiceImpl greetServer() method before
the return line:

    final Queue queue = QueueFactory.getDefaultQueue();
    queue.add(TaskOptions.Builder.url(""/taskrunner"").param(""id"",
    UUID.randomUUID().toString()));

      final Queue queue = QueueFactory.getDefaultQueue();

    }
      }

Remove GWT from the Project (uncheck use GWT) and hit http://127.0.0.1:8888/taskrunnertest - no exception is thrown. (With GWT enabled that url throws the exception).


This used to work with GWT enabled. Please can someone advise a fix as its cost me 2

I'm trying to calculate in advance how much does GAE will cost per user and will the income from ads will cover these expenses.

* The player can update his profile statistics, happens whenever a higher stat was achieved (higher score, etc...). There are a total of 6 statistics the game keep track of.
* The player can request to view friends profiles

Assuming an average player that plays for 30 minutes per day as a basis for calculations, and has 5 friends playing the game:

* The total number of updates to his own profile doesn't exceed 300 life.
* The number of profile requests is about 100/month (I cache profiles using memcache for 2 hours)
* According to GAE, the datastore pricing are $0.10/100K write ops and $0.07/100K read ops.
* The data structure of a player profile, consists of 7 fields and requires 16 ops to store/retrieve it.

The monthly cost per player:

* Write - [ (300 * 16) / 100000 ] * $0.10 = $0.0048 life
* Read - [ (10 * 10 * 16) / 100000 ] * $0.07 = $0.0016 monthly  // 10 profile views per day times 10 days per month

So the average monthly cost per user, assuming the retention is 3 months will be $0.0032 and that consists of the datastore api pricing alone.

Assuming the retention is 3 months, the total play time per day is 30 minutes and the player plays for 10 days per month.

Does the earning from advertisements will cover the $0.0036/month cost ?

Would someone please give me some hint as how to do this?

What I actually wanna do is to transfer data from Google App Engine tables to BigQuery (and sync on a daily basis), so that I can do some analysis. I use the Google Cloud Storage Service in Google App Engine to write (new) records to files in Google Cloud Storage, and the only missing part is to append the data to tables in BigQuery (or create a new table for first time write). Admittedly I can manually upload/append the data using the BigQuery browser tool, but I would like it to be automatic, otherwise I need to manually do it everyday.

My understanding of Dynamic DNS is that it is a technology that somehow allows you to immediately change the DNS settings of your web app URL without having to wait the standard 24 hours for DNS changes to ""ripple out"" over all the DNS servers in the world and take affect.

So first off, if anything I have said so far is misguided or incorrect, please begin by correcting me!

Assuming I am more or less correct, I'm trying to protect my web app (as best as I can) against DDoS attacks.

For one, I have decided to host my app with either Google App Engine or Heroku (haven't made the final decision yet), and I have to imagine that their IT staff is fully prepared to scale up/handle if my app is DDoSed while deployed to their servers.

Unfortunately for me, that means they'll *scale up and handle* the attack (!), which means my billing would soar through the roof and I'd be out of business (I guess that's called a ""cash attack""!).

So I need a solution that handles both of the following scenarios:

* The DDoS is enormous, and even Google/Heroku say ""enough is enough"", we're not supporting this load!
* I specify a billing ""ceiling"" (which both Google and Heroku provide), and after that ceiling is reached, I somehow redirect traffic to my CloudFlare/read-only web app hosted elsewhere

I suspect I will need to use Dynamic DNS somehow to handle the 2nd scenario, but without knowing how most web apps fortify themselves against DDoSes (i.e. I've hear of so called ""bastion hosts""?!?)

",google-app-engine,jinja2,,,,,open,0,1230,7,"TemplateNotFound(template) with Google App Engine & Jinja2 I'm getting a TemplateNotFound error on Google App Engine with Jinja2 (complete stack trace below.)

What I expect to see is the index.html with the ""greet"" variable passed to the index.html template file.  What I don't understand is why I get the template not found error when the path to index.html in the TraceBack is correct.

What I've tried...

- tried a relative path by taking out ""os.path.dirname(__file__)"" in template path.
- using ""template"" instead of themes as a directory name.

I don't want to blow up this post so I uploaded screenshots from JProfiler.

Reference tree is [here][1]. Allocation tree is [here][2].

I found [this bug][3] on Objectify's tracker and also [this thread][4] on Google Ground for GAE. So I'm not sure whose bug this is.

1) How to avoid memory leak?
2) Does it happen in production?

The thing is, i need to authorize the incoming mails and determine a destination based on _alone_ on the **TO** field. This is to let people integrate the service in whatever email sending systems they already have running.

At least i need to variables, a key and a destination (which is also an email address):

An example could be: 

`af922514-60bc-4595-956d-ec29e6351d8e,kristian@mide.dk@application.appspotmail.com`

Thats not really going to work (i think), is there any way to escape the first @, or should i go a completely other way around this? 

I've thought about base encoding it so:

    af922514-60bc-4595-956d-ec29e6351d8e,kristian@mide.dk@application.appspotmail.com

    YWY5MjI1MTQtNjBiYy00NTk1LTk1NmQtZWMyOWU2MzUxZDhlLGtyaXN0aWFuQG1pZGUuZGs=@application.appspotmail.com

I'm not sure the ending '=' is allowed in email addresses though 

Any thoughts on this?


",google-app-engine,email,email-integration,incoming-mail,,,open,0,131,4,"Designing an email ""api"" So, im building this webservice on Googles app engine, and i would like it to receive emails.

The thing is, i need to authorize the incoming mails and determine a destination based on _alone_ on the **TO** field. This is to let people integrate the service in whatever email sending systems they already have running.

At least i need to variables, a key and a destination (which is also an email address):

An example could be: 

`af922514-60bc-4595-956d-ec29e6351d8e,kristian@mide.dk@application.appspotmail.com`

Thats not really going to work (i think), is there any way to escape the first @, or should i go a completely other way around this? 

I've thought about base encoding it so:

    af922514-60bc-4595-956d-ec29e6351d8e,kristian@mide.dk@application.appspotmail.com

besomes this:
