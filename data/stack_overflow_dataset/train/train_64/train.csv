I'm using an actor that itself has an anonymous actor that consumes an input stream. The problem is that this stream only reads one line and then blocks without waking up again.

So far my research has narrowed the choice down to either Erlang or a JVM based language.  
Erlang is widely known for it's focus on scalable and fault-tolerant distributed applications and proven track record, but on the other hand it's library ecosystem is nowhere as rich as JVM's.

    val criteria = Map(User_.name -> ""Doe"", User_.id -> 5)
    // Produces Compiler Error
    val persons = userEJB.findByAttributes(criteria)

Unfortunately, the compiler isn't satisfied when passing searchFor to the findByAttributes-function, producing the error below:

That's the most complicated generic problem i ever had. A bit too high for my skill ;) Anyone knows how i can build the right map type that i can pass to the function? Is it even possible, or can't the compiler infer the type anymore in my case? Or am i using the wrong datastructure?",2

    if(ask(""Continue?"")) //Prompts Yes/No
      name = input(""Enter your name"")

Where `ask` returns a boolean if the user pressed yes, and `input` asks for a value. Picture this being called from a web server, where `ask` and `input` do not block any threads, they just store a continuation in a Map (or the session, doesn't matter much) before displaying the page with the prompt (releasing most resources). And when a response get's back, it looks-up the continuation in the Map and resumes the code.

The problem so far is that I cannot seem to be able to find a suitable way to define `ask` and `input` to use continuations without passing the calling context's return type as a parameter.

The closest I got is doing something like:

    #!/bin/sh

It is probably a newbie Scala and/or functional programming question.  I have lots of Java and OO experience, but I am new to Scala and FP.

Now I'm going to process this list and return an XML tree (scala.xml.NodeSeq or whatever).  The tricky part is I need to replace any cases of c&lt;n&gt; with a span that encloses any following items, up to the next ce.  Further complicating things is nesting must be handled, but any ""ce"" items encountered need to close out all pending <span> tags.

==============

In the example linked [here][1] there is this example about form validation:

    // You can also define ad-hoc constraints on the fields:
    val loginForm = Form(
      tuple(
        ""email"" -> nonEmptyText,
        ""password"" -> text
      ) verifying(""Invalid user name or password"", fields => fields match { 
          case (e, p) => User.authenticate(e,p).isDefined 
      })
    )

Via binding errors some constraints are displayed in my form. (Like the `nonEmptyText`, that gets a extra line behind the field stating `This field is required`. See:

    loginForm.bindFromRequest.fold(
      formWithErrors => // binding failure, you retrieve the form containing errors,
      value => // binding success, you get the actual value 
    )
If I do a `.toString` to the `formWithErrors` i get this for the `nonEmptyText` constraint:

    Form(ObjectMapping2(<function2>,<function1>,(Email adress,FieldMapping(,List(Constraint(Some(constraint.required),WrappedArray())))),(Password,FieldMapping(,List(Constraint(Some(constraint.required),WrappedArray())))),,List(Constraint(None,List()))),Map(Password -> test, Email adress -> ),List(FormError(Email adress,error.required,WrappedArray())),None)

The latter part is a [FormError][2] List: `List(FormError(Email adress,error.required,WrappedArray())),None)` which is a case class: `case class FormError (key: String, message: String, args: Seq[Any])` where `key` is defined as: `The error key (should be associated with a field using the same key).`.

The FieldConstructor picks this up and makes the 'Email adress' input box go red and add the error message ('This field is required').


Displaying the ad hoc constraints?
-----------------
So when the form fields are all filled the username and password are checked: 

    verifying(""Invalid user name or password"", fields => fields match { 
          case (e, p) => User.authenticate(e,p).isDefined 
      })

But i dont know how to display the 'Invalid user name or password' to the user. The `.toString` of the `FormError` List of `formWithErrors` is:

    List(FormError(,Invalid user name or password,WrappedArray())),None)

The `Key` part is empty.

Question
-----------------
How do i display the ad hoc error?

I even tried:

    BadRequest( views.html.test( formWithErrors ) ).flashing( ""error"" -> ""Invalid user name or password."" ) },

but for some reason its not working via the Flash either :(. This `@flash.get(""error"").getOrElse(""no 'error'"")` gives me 'no error' each time.

Once an occurence is found, I want to replace the occurence with a defined replacement and run the same search again until the list stops changing.

Scenario:
---------

I have three types of `Op` case classes. `Pop()` extends `Op`, `Push()` extends `Op` and  `Nop()` extends `Op`. I want to replace the occurence of `Push(), Pop()` with `Nop()`. Basically the code could look like `seq.replace(Push() ~ Pop() ~> Nop())`.

Problem:
--------

Now that I call `seq.replace(...)` I will have to search in the sequence for an occurence of `Push(), Pop()`. So far so good. I find the occurence. But now I will have to splice the occurence form the list and insert the replacement.

Now there are two options. My list could be mutable or immutable. If I use an immutable list I am scared regarding performance because those sequences are usually 500+ elements in size. If I replace a lot of occurences like `A ~ B ~ C ~> D ~ E` I will create a lot of new objects If I am not mistaken. However I could also use a mutable sequence like `ListBuffer[Op]`.

Basically from a linked-list background I would just do some pointer-bending and after a total of four operations I am done with the replacement without creating new objects. That is why I am now concerned about performance. Especially since this is a performance-critical operation for me.

Question:
---------
How would you implement the `replace()` method in a Scala fashion and what kind of data structure would you use keeping in mind that this is a performance-critical operation?

I am happy with answers that point me in the right direction or pseudo code. No need to write a full replace method.

I have broken up my code to perform in a modular way so that it can be distributed and run in a parallel way (hopefully).

    @Transactional(readOnly = false, propagation = Propagation.REQUIRES_NEW)
    public void runMyJob(List<String> some params){
      doComplexEnoughStuffAndWriteToMysqlDB();
    }
    
Now, I have been thinking of the following options for parallelizing this problem and I'd like people's thoughts/experience in this area.

Options I am currently thinking of:

1) Use JEE (eg JBoss) clustering and MessageDrivenBeans. The MDBs are on the slave nodes in the cluster. Each MDB can pick up an event which kicks off a job as above. AFAIK JEE MDBs are multithreaded by the app server so this should hopefully also be able to take advantage of multicores. Thus it should be vertically and horizontally scalable.

2) I could look at using something like Hadoop and Map Reduce. Concerns I would have here is that my job processing logic is actually quite high level so I'm not sure how translatable that is to Map Reduce. Also, I'm a total newbie to MR.

3) I could look at something like Scala which I believe makes concurrency programming much simpler. However, while this is vertically scalable, it's not a cluster/horizontally scalable solution.

Anyway, hope all that makes sense and thank you very much for any help provided.

",scala,architecture,java-ee,clustering,mapreduce,,open,0,248,5,"Parallelization/Cluster Options For Code Execution I'm coming from a java background and have a CPU bound problem that I'm trying to parallelize to improve performance. I have broken up my code to perform in a modular way so that it can be distributed and run in a parallel way (hopefully).

    @Transactional(readOnly = false, propagation = Propagation.REQUIRES_NEW)
    public void runMyJob(List<String> some params){
      doComplexEnoughStuffAndWriteToMysqlDB();
    }
    
Now, I have been thinking of the following options for parallelizing this problem and I'd like people's thoughts/experience in this area.

Options I am currently thinking of:

1) Use JEE (eg JBoss) clustering and MessageDrivenBeans. The MDBs are on the slave nodes in the cluster. Each MDB can pick up an event which kicks off a job as above. AFAIK JEE MDBs are multithreaded by the app server so this should hopefully also be able to take advantage of multicores. Thus it should be vertically and horizontally scalable.

2) I could look at using something like Hadoop and Map Reduce. Concerns I would have here is that my job processing logic is actually quite high level so I'm not sure how translatable that is to Map Reduce. Also, I'm a total newbie to MR.

3) I could look at something like Scala which I believe makes concurrency programming much simpler. However, while this is vertically scalable, it's not a cluster/horizontally scalable solution.

Anyway, hope all that makes sense and thank you very much for any help provided.

kind regards,
Brian

Also looking at developing mobile apps for the same application where people can send carpool request over their phones.Looking for a stack which can complement the mobile development also.

I know there are various solutions for this, but I'm looking to learn something new and exciting and have fun while developing it.

I have been a Java developer for 14 years and have written an enterprise-level (~500,000 line) Swing application that uses most of the standard library APIs. Recently, I have become disappointed with the progress that the language has made to ""modernize"" itself, and am looking for an alternative for ongoing development.

I have considered moving to the .NET platform, but I have issues with using something the only runs well in Windows (I know about Mono, but that is still far behind Microsoft). I also plan on buying a new Macbook Pro as soon as Apple releases their new rumored Arrandale-based machines and want to develop in an environment that will feel ""at home"" in Unix/Linux.

I have considered using Python or Ruby, but the standard Java library is arguably the largest of any modern language.

In JVM-based languages, I looked at Groovy, but am disappointed with its performance. Rumor has it that with the soon-to-be released JDK7, with its InvokeDynamic instruction, this will improve, but I don't know how much. Groovy is also not truly a functional language, although it provides closures and some of the ""functional"" features on collections. It does not embrace immutability.

I have narrowed my search down to two JVM-based alternatives: Scala and Clojure. Each has its strengths and weaknesses. I am looking for the stackoverflow readerships' opinions. I am not an expert at either of these languages; I have read 2 1/2 books on Scala and am currently reading Stu Halloway's book on Clojure.

Scala is strongly statically typed. I know the dynamic language folks claim that static typing is a crutch for not doing unit testing, but it does provide a mechanism for compile-time location of a whole class of errors. Scala is more concise than Java, but not as much as Clojure.

Scala's inter-operation with Java seems to be better than Clojure's, in that most Java operations are easier to do in Scala than in Clojure. For example, I can find no way in Clojure to create an non-static initialization block in a class derived from a Java superclass.

For example, I like the Apache commons CLI library for command line argument parsing. In Java and Scala, I can create a new Options object and add Option items to it in an initialization block as follows (Java code):

    final Options options = new Options() {
      {
        addOption(new Option(""?"", ""help"", false, ""Show this usage information"");
        // other options
      }
    };

I can't figure out how to the same thing in Clojure (except by using (doit...)), although that may reflect my lack of knowledge of the language.

Clojure's collections are optimized for immutability. They rarely require copy-on-write semantics. I don't know if Scala's immutable collections are implemented using similar algorithms, but Rich Hickey (Clojure's inventor) goes out of his way to explain how that language's data structures are efficient.

Clojure was designed from the beginning for concurrency (as was Scala) and with modern multi-core processors, concurrency takes on more importance, but I occasionally need to write simple non-concurrent utilities, and Scala code probably runs a little faster for these applications since it discourages, but does not prohibit, ""simple"" mutability. One could argue that one-off utilities do not have to be super-fast, but sometimes they do tasks that take hours or days to complete.

I know that there is no right answer to this ""question"", but I thought I would open it up for discussion. If anyone has a suggestion for another JVM-based language that can be used for enterprise level development, please list it. Also, it is not my intent to start a flame war.

I'm trying to work out a set of generic adapters for such functions, so that I can use them in a State monad pipeline.

This is possibly entirely wrongheaded; feel free to make that case.

I apologize in advance for mix of Java and pidgin Scala.  I'm actually doing this in Java as a learning exercise, but nobody has time to read all that.  I've elided a lot of uninteresting complexity for the sake of discussion; don't worry about the domain modeling.

The state in question is this:

    ImportState(row:CsvRow, contact:Contact, result:ImportResult)

`ImportResult` is one of `ADD`, `MERGE`, or `REJECT`.

The functions I've defined are these:

    def rowToContact: ImportRow => Contact
    
    def findMergeCandidates: Contact => (Contact, List[Contact])

    // merges, or declines to merge, setting the result
    def merge: (Contact, List[Contact]) => (Contact, ImportResult)  
    
    def persist: Contact => ImportResult
    
    def commitOrRollback: ImportState => ImportState
    
    def notifyListener: ImportState => Nothing

The adapters I've defined so far are pretty simple, and deal with individual properties of `ImportState`:

    def getRow: ImportState => ImportRow
    
    def getContact: ImportState => Contact

    def setRow(f: _ => ImportRow): ImportState => ImportState

    def setContact(f: _ => Contact): ImportState => ImportState

    def setResult(f: _ => ImportResult): ImportState => ImportState

The (broken) pipeline looks something like this (in Java):

    State.<ImportState>init()
        .map( setRow( constant(row) ) )
        .map( setContact( getRow.andThen(rowToContact) ) )
        .map( getContact.andThen(findMergeCandidates).andThen(merge) ) // this is where it falls apart
        .map( setResult( getContact.andThen(persist) ) )
        // ... lots of further processing of the persisted contact
        .map(commitOrRollback)
        .map(notifyListener);
 
The immediate problem is that `merge` returns a tuple `(Contact, ImportResult)`, which I'd like to apply to two properties of the state (`contact` and `result`), while keeping the third property, `row`.

So far, I've come up with a couple of approaches to adaptation of merge that both suck:

1. Define some functions that pack and unpack tuples, and use them directly in the pipeline.  This option is extremely noisy.

2. Define a one-off adapter for `ImportState` and `merge`.  This option feels like giving up.

Is there a better way?

The PlayerRegistrar assigns a number of players between tables. First, it works out how many tables it will need to break up the players between and creates a List of them. 

Then in the second part of the code, it works out which table a player should be assigned to, pulls that table from the list and registers a new player on that table.

The list of players on a table is a var, and is overwritten each time registerPlayer() is called. I have checked that this works correctly through a simple TestNG test:
<pre><code>@Test def testRegisterPlayer_multiplePlayers() {
    val table = new Table(1)
    (1 to 10).foreach { playerNumber =>
        val player = new Player(playerNumber)
        table.registerPlayer(player)
        assert(table.players.contains(player))
        assert(table.players.length == playerNumber)
    }
}</code></pre>

I then test the table assignment:
<pre><code>  @Test def testAssignPlayerToTables_1table() = {
    val tables = PlayerRegistrar.assignPlayersToTables(10, 10)
    assertEquals(tables.length, 1)

 I have the following Scala code, which compiles and gives an error.
 Actually I am expecting the code not be compiled as it has an abstract type CT. And the error is even more confusing as the scala says it can't find the type CT.

    class Currency {   type ct=Currency } 
    val c = new Currency
    println(c.ct)

> error: value ct is not a member of Currency
