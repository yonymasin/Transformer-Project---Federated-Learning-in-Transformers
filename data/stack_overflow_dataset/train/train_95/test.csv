I've been unable to install mvc 4 for vs 2010 after many attempts. I had the mvc 4 beta installed because I created a webapi project. I also had mvc 2 & 3 installed. I uninstalled mvc 4 using the (bundle) link in Programs n Features ... Now trying to install mvc 4 and i'm getting an  undescriptive error log that  I can't make heads or tails of ... any help would be appreciated.

My system environment contains 

windows 7 x64 enterprise
vs 2010 sp1 ( see info below log file)
Web Platform Installer 4.0

I have resolved the issue, but wonder why it is so. Maybe someone can answer this. Maybe this info will help someone else.

My javascript was as such:

    var userServicePath = serverPath + '/Login/RegisterUserDetails/' + userId;
    $.getJSON(userServicePath, null, createAndPopulateHiddenFields);

My Controller ran a query, populated an object and returned the object via:
    
    return Json(qry, JsonRequestBehavior.AllowGet);

This worked fine until I added a few more fields. After modifying the object and controller, my response in IE showed null for my new fields. The breakpoint on the return value in the controller verified the new values were getting into the object properly. Even Firebug showed the values.

Just an FYI, my routing in MVC is set up with an id value for the third value in the url. Anyone have any ideas why this would work in FF, but not in IE.

And for the fix,... I removed the userId from the userServicePath string and added it as a parameter in the getJSON code.

    var userServicePath = serverPath + '/Login/RegisterUserDetails';
    $.getJSON(userServicePath, { id: userId }, createAndPopulateHiddenFields);

If anyone has an answer, that would be great.

I have the following so far:

        db.employee.AddObject(empmodel.employee);

When an employee record is created, it creates an EmpID record which is autogenerated.
I need to get that EmpID and create a new record in the address table with that EmpID as

I am not sure how to get the EmpID from employee table and then create a new record for the address table. I thought I could get it after AddObject but it did not create an employee record.

To my mind, MVC is supposed to separate three parts of a web-application: the Model (dealing with the data: fetching, changing etc.), the Controller (desciding what data to return as a response depending on a user request) and the View (transforming the data got from the Controller (eg. to HTML) for sending back to user as a response).

""Separation"" means that those three elements are abstract from one another. The Controller doesn't care about the details of the realization of the Model part (and vice versa), it just tells what data he needs to get (or to change) and knows how to process it, the Model has nothing to do with the View (that is with the way data would be transformed).
Finally, the Controller has nothing to do with the View transformation, he just knows what data need to be transformed (depending on a request) and in what way (that is eg. selecting the correct template for the current data).
And the View part is abstract from the Controller, its job is to transform the specific array of input data in some preset way.

So now let's say I've got a web-site. It has the index page (/), and some non-index pages (/vacancy/, /about/, /articles/bytag/fun/5/ etc.).
At the top of each page there is a logo. The problem is: I want the logo to be a hyperlink to the index page on every page of my site except the index page itself (because I don't want my pages to contain hyperlinks to themselves).
So I want ""&lt;img src='logo.png'&gt;"" on the index page and ""&lt;a href=""/""&gt;&lt;img src='logo.png'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;"" on other pages.

Of course, i don't want to repeat myself and create several templates (header_index and header_nonindex) with the same logo image. So, what I need to do is to check if I'm on the index page in some place of my template (that is inside the View part) and depending on the result to add or not to add the link tag.

And here i face a logical problem. I can't get the adress in the View (because logically this part has nothing to do with user request, it transforms data, recieved from the Controller).
So I need my Controller to send the specific data (eg. the page adress, or the boolean like ""isIndex"") to the View. But the View can't ""require"" data from the Controller, the View is just the way data is transformed. So if any specific variable is needed for the transformation itself, adding it to the Controller would make the View dependent on the specific Controller and the Controller - related to the specific View which would break the whole idea of abstraction and separation.
Thus there is no way to do what I need without breaking the MVC logic.
