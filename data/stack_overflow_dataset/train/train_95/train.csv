When question list clicked i want to bind my chart with a query according to selected questionId.

So my plan was;
1. get questionId from selected question row. it's ok.

2. defining ClientEvents.OndataBinding event on my chart. So i would be able to 
pass questionId with; 

    function onChartDataBinding(e) {
            e.data = $.extend(e.data, { questionId: questionId });

3. using `$('#ChartPollResults').data('tChart').rebind();` on question list grid row selected event.

This scenario works when i have second grid binding according to first grids selected row.
But it seems there is no ClientEvents.OnDataBinding event on chart control.
And ""`rebind()`"" method isn't supported on Chart control.

When it comes to URI routing, I'm familiar with the standard URI format of

    /controller/action/id

And parsing the data out of this to control the routing wouldn't be too difficult. Now, what I'm moreso wondering about is the performance difference between having nginx parse this URI string out into a query string of some type to pass to a controller directly, so that would end up like

    /foo/bar/12 => /application/foo.php?action=bar&id=12

I'm aware that nginx passes the url, query string, and other things to php-fpm in other variables already, but this is just for illustrative purposes to show what I'm thinking.

Is this a stupid thing to do? I know that by defining routes explicitly in nginx would mean me needing to restart nginx every time I alter the routes in the config, which could be a downside.

So, to restate the question: When it comes to MVC routing, is there any worthwhile performance gain by having the actual webserver (in this case, nginx) itself handle the routing to the controller OR is using a standard landing script (like index.php in the root of the directory) and passing along the URI to be parsed for routing perfectly fine?

I have a few months of experience with web application development with an MVC framework (CakePHP), so I get the basics, but I began to see a theme that made me think I'm taking a flawed approach to where I put my logic:

 - Fat models, skinny controllers
 - Keep as much business logic in the models as possible

In my app, models are anorexic and controllers are obese. I have all business logic in the controllers and nothing besides associations and validation rules in the models.

Scanning through my controllers, I can now identify a lot of logic that should probably go in a model:

 - The app has lists, which contain items, and the items can be ranked. The sorting logic which puts the list in ranked order is in a controller.
 - Similarly, items (Item model) also have images (Image model). Each item may have a default image (designated by image_id in the items table). When an item is displayed with its images, the default image should appear first. I have the logic that does this in a controller.
 - When a list is displayed, related lists are displayed in the sidebar. The logic to determine which lists are related is in a controller.

Now to my questions:

 1. With the examples I gave above, am I on the right track in thinking that those are instances of logic presently in a controller that belongs in a model?
 2. What are some other areas of logic, common to web apps, that should go into models?
 3. I'm sure identifying this problem and changing my design pattern is half the battle, but even if I decide to take those examples I gave above and try to move that logic to a model, I wouldn't know where to begin. Can anyone point me in the right direction by posting some code here, or linking to some good learning resources? CakePHP specific help would be great, but I'm sure anything MVC will suffice.

I have an Action that returns a FileStreamResult after it imports a PDF document and stamps it with a watermark.  Since it is possible to have a file not found error, how do I return a view instead of a filestream?

To complicate things I am using Philip Hutchison's jQuery PDFObject (<http://pdfobject.com>) to call the action and render it in a DIV so I cannot redirect on the server side.

To reiterate:  It's a jQuery link on the page that fills a DIV with the results from a PDF filestream.  The only 'hack' thing that I can think of is to send an Error.pdf file.

What I would consider to be necessary for a good framework:

 - web application interface for connecting to http servers (like Rack)
 - chainable middleware (again, like Rack or node.js Connect)
 - idiomatic Haskell

I think it does a convincing job of portraying the evil side of getters/setters. I've tested this by trying to convert an existing project (unfinished) to code without getters/setters. It worked. Code readability improved greatly, less code and I've even managed to get rid of getters/setters where I initially thought they really were necessary. Except for one place.

Getting models to the view part is where I think this approach misses the point. In the article the author uses a builder to export the model. The problem is: there's just as many control over what is put into the builder as what you would have gotten with getters. Yes it hides the implementation, the way it is represented in the model. But getters don't get out of the model something very different from what was put in there. If you create a Money object passing '5' through the constructor, money.getAmount() won't return this converted to some other currency or as an array with one element '5' in it.

What you set you get. And through the view we set values, and those values we expect when we ask them (get) from an object that is supposed to hold what we set in the first place. A builder to export these just expects the same.

This is a bit long for a question. But I would like to be challenged on my view. Are getters and setters evil for transporting model-data to the view layer?

There are a lot of people who thing getters/setters are not evil at all. This is also not what I would like to hear defended, as I think they DO are evil in other places than those I mentioned.

- the control flow 
- and all parameters

of web-application (controllers) against **highjacking**.

The technique provides this:

- All **parameters** of request are kept at the **server side**
- No parameter ever reaches any URL
- The **control flow** of an application strictly gets **controlled by server-side state**

The base principle is this:

- Define a server side controller **FlowController**

- If a web page needs to include a link to another controller with certain parameters, ask FlowController to prepare the link

- FlowController does not provide the link directly, but **maintains a server side state**, which keeps all link-related information [controller class to be called, arguments to get passed]

- Ultimately, FlowController returns not an actual link, but a random hash-value, which identifies the server side's state

- Once a link comes back from the browser, it gets passed to FlowController, which looks up the related state and manages to instantiate the controller and pass arguments

**Consequences:** No link can be predicted. Thus, no controller can be called with before getting authorization by FlowController.


Moreover:

- FlowController manages link states using a stack

- FlowController provides set-back points: FlowControler::TerminateFlow() forces the application to re-establish the last set-back point. 

- If FlowController gets asked to start a non-top flow, it automatically deletes all flows above. Thus, if you return to an earlier state of the application, all follow-up states automatically get invalidated.

Since I've never seen such a mechanism in frameworks, I wonder if this is a new pattern. 

**Question: Is this a new pattern? If not, what's the pattern it conforms to?**

Organizations will be able to submit childcare events, volunteers will be able to sign up to do childcare at the event, and admins will do approval and editing. That is the core of the application.

So, where I'm at is this: should I use Drupal, or a framework?

Drupal seems like it would get me through a lot of the harder stuff, especially handing the views and implementing a pre-built calendar, handling basic user support, db layer etc etc, as well as having good security.

Code Igniter is appealing partly because I'm more interested in coding then clicking endlessly through the Drupal UI, I'm interested in the MVC framework, and I'd be able to code the profiles and custom forms just as I need them, and avoid having to carry the weight of a CMS, which I'm not really building.

On the downside, I might be faced with having to write a lot of code by brute force that has already been coded better, tested and secured. That said, I'm not sure how extensive the available Code Igniter libraries are (probably a good next step for me!).

So, my question is – for those who have worked with either Drupal, Code Igniter or (preferably) both – what would you do? Is there another framework or open source application that would fit the bill?

I'm programming MVC with PHP-Activerecord and a custom framework in an enterprise setting with a SOAP-based SOA. Now I'm trying to access and/or persist basically the *same* entity over different access layers, depending on the situation. To be a bit more to the point, I will choose an example:

There is a ""Member"" entity in our system. Now one way to access this member is over a SOAP webservice for which I have written an abstractor:

    class Member extends ServiceAbstractor {}

Pro: Live access to the data (there is no other way for me to reach the production database directly).

Con: Pretty slow and I can't do things like a ""JOIN"" with other entities or a ""SELECT LIKE '%member1%'"" easily due to the architecture which I cannot change.

Another way is to access the same entity through an older database replication. For that I would use a syntax like this:

    class Member extends ActiveRecord\Model { /* Connection 1 */ }

Pro: Blazingly fast and I can do all the fancy stuff described above to do filtering, reporting and aggregation on the Member Data with SQL.

Con: Readonly, data is a little older (but does not really matter for most applications).

Sometimes, I even need to store additional metadata on the member, like who changed something about it for example.

For that I would use a local MySQL database, also with ActiveRecord, but on a different connection:

    class Member extends ActiveRecord\Model { /* Connection 2 */ }

Now I would basically love to work with the same entity ""Member"" in a logical perspective, but obviously I cannot inherit the same class from three different access layers.

Probable use case: Get a member ID via a partial name search from the database copy (SELECT LIKE), then get the ""real"" member from the webservice, update it with something and then store the editor and last changes for this member in my local database.

Now I could name the respective classes something like ""Member"", ""MemberCopy"" and ""MemberMeta"" (?), but that leaves me a little unsatisfied, as think I'm talking about the very same entity here.

  The problem is that when you click to edit any user from the UI grid there an AJAX that post JSON to containing the information for the user which include the 'groups' column which actually is not part of the 'users' table. So I have this:

And try to implement all the logic in one function(If this even possible, I couldn't find info if I can have two different active record queris in one function) or the second thing I thought of was after decoding the JSON to make something like:

It looks very much like the developers before me had heard of MVC but didn't understand the ideas of abstraction or modularity. So the MVC ""framework"" is a) bespoke b) broken c) patched and d) there are several in use all at once. I intend to fix that.

This is not the first time I've re-built a site's framework, BTW, but it is the first time I've had to fix an MVC framework. However, I'm coming up against some missing holes in the MVC knowledge here on SO. 

The first is how closely programmers seem to tie their SQL database with their models. This doesn't make sense to me: do programmers normally have the model looking after the data abstraction? (To me this is little better than putting SQL in raw PHP code.) Or is there a data access layer normally employed that ""Does SQL""? I know from experience that the latter means the calling code doesn't have to worry about where the data is, or how to get it or how to write it: the API handles that. 

But what about the Models? Are they intended to be re-usable amongst different pages? Should they care about just where the data is stored? Shouldn't they be more concerned with handling the logic between data-fetch and data-show (e.g. turning a contact's group ID into a displayable name)? And data-save and data-write (e.g. figuring out how to turn $_POST values into savable data)?

Maybe the MVC model really be DMVC - Data-Model-View-Controller.

Details: To enable the details of this specific error message to be viewable on the local server machine, please create a <customErrors> tag within a ""web.config"" configuration file located in the root directory of the current web application. This <customErrors> tag should then have its ""mode"" attribute set to ""RemoteOnly"". To enable the details to be viewable on remote machines, please set ""mode"" to ""Off"".


Is it the case that error handling in the root site cannot be used in the area sites?

Thanks

John.


",mvc,,,,,,open,0,200,4,"MVC Area Error Handling I have a MVC project set up with 3 areas.  In the main project I have error handling set up
using custom errors in the web.config.

    <customErrors mode=""On"" defaultRedirect=""~/Error/HttpError"">
         <error statusCode=""404"" redirect=""~/Error/Http404"" />     </customErrors>

This cause the site to redirect to a error controller in the root and then show the error view.

This works OK in the root site, however when I throw an exception in the home controller of one
of the area sites it the message below.

I've changed the document root to a non mvc directory (just pointed to the content directory) and it serves the mp3 fine, so it's not an iis issue, but an mvc routing issue.

so... why is it grabbing the .mp3 extension? I dont have any routes with mp3 in them...
