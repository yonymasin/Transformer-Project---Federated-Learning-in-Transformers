My question is specifically, what are the implications of storing sort-codes and account numbers online, considering we are not taking any kind of payment.  So, nothing to do with using the information to make payments through the system, but using the information to enable other users who have access to the system to make payments.

I understand that if we did have payment provision on the website we are developing, then the storage of account numbers would affect the level of PCI compliance we would need to adhere to.

Currently we are adhering to what would be considered security 'best practices', so using SSL, encrypting information in the db, dedicated server with hardware firewall etc., but these 'best practices' are from an internal point of view of a development team.  I know the software in PCI compliance is only one part of overall security regulations.  Outside of PCI compliance, is there, for example, a definitive set of rules for storing sensitive information?  Are we for example obligated to adhere to ISO 27001 standards?  Who defines what information is considered 'sensitive'.

The general consensus regarding PCI compliance and the handling of credit cards, is if you need to ask then you shouldn't be doing it.  I'm not necessarily asking whether or how we can do it or not, but whether anyone has experience of this, and whether we need to engage a 3rd party consultant who specialises in such areas.

I know this could be the type of question that gets the Stack Overlow community annoyed as it isn't an outright programming question.  I do understand that this isn't a legal Q&A site, but the roots of this question are in programming, so I do believe it to be relevant.

 - While researching about authentication mechanisms, I realized that plain old SESSIONID Cookie based tokens over HTTP are pretty much broken.
 - Figuring that it'll be easier if I just figured out what the big boys were doing, I came across Firesheep. _Looks like the Emperor has no clothes, and nobody cares._
 - The only sureshot way to web security is HTTPS.
 - Still, for reasons, almost, but not entirely, clear to me, not everybody has switched to HTTPS. Our own Stackoverflow (even security.stackexchange.com) can be Firesheeped, and they are still on Plain Ol' HTTP.
 - There are actually two threats involved - MITM attacks and Replay attacks. 
 - AFAIK, there is no way to protect against MITM attacks without resorting to HTTPS (or rolling your own). 
 - So for the remainder of this question, I wish to focus on protection against Replay attacks (which are much more of a practical problem being really easy to orchestrate, a la Firesheep). The assumption is that we make the initial contact using HTTPS (to set up the initial secrets/nonces etc) and the remainder of the session progresses on HTTP. 
 - Under such a set-up, people have been using various methods to provide some semblance of security for session-id's: 
  - Generating a new nonce for every request (i.e. each client-server interaction starts with the client providing a previously decided challenge, and the server invalidating the old challenge code and providing a new one to be used the next time around). This works (remember, I am talking protection only against replay attacks, not MITMs). Rather, it used to work, before the advent of AJAX.
  - For AJAXey applications, having a single pending challenge is not useful, as it is hard to orchestrate all the XHRs your application is making (The Asynchronous in AJAX). So devs have resorted to new tricks, both of which invalidate the security against Replay attacks that the single pending nonce strategy provided:
     - Generating a bunch of nonces, any of which can be used for authentication. You can hand over each of your XHR's one of these pending nonces. By itself, this strategy is broken, because every once in a while the client and server will have to sync up and decide on the next set of nonces, and the attacker gain sniff this interaction.
     - Timestamps. By itself, this is a brittle fix. While on the surface it would seem that setting the timeout to a very short time would prevent Firesheep like attacks, deeper thought reveals that that would be pretty ineffective for automated cookie sniffing attacks. Remember, the attacker has to gain entry only once, because then he would part of the interaction by which the server and client sync up of further nonces.
 - phew! You made it so far :)

Before proceeding, let me make clear my rationale for asking this question: curiosity. Curiosity as to why people are not using one of the methods (listed below) to provide security in the interim as the web moves towards full on HTTPS (it is moving there, right :?).

So here is my question: Are any/none/both of the following protocols secure -

**Method 1: HTTPS Side Channel**

Assumptions 

  - We have a HTTPS server.
  - We wish to protect only against Replay Attacks.  

Protocol
 
- Before sending any request, ajax or otherwise, the client requests a nonce from the server over the HTTPS side channel. This it sends alongwith the session cookie when doing the actual request over HTTP.

Pros

 - Minimal change in your existing webapp.

  

**Method 2: Secure ID**

Assumptions

  - We have a initial HTTPS handshake.
  - We wish to protect only against Replay Attacks.

Method
  
- In the initial HTTPS handshake, the client and server exchange a secret that is used to seed a PRG (Pseudo Random Generator). The server maintains a window of the output of the PRG. 
- For each request, ajax or otherwise, the client picks the next output of the PRG, and attaches it as a nonce to the session cookie, and sends it over HTTP. The server compares the nonce to any of the numbers within the current PRG output window.

Pros

* Expired
* Tamper Resistant
* Single Use
* Resistant to replay attacks

The format of the reset code I have come up with is:

B64(B64(iv)||B64(E(uid||timestamp)))

Where B64 is base64 encoding and E is for symmetric encryption. The iv is the initialization vector used for encryption (randomly generated), and is in the clear. The || indicates concatenation and I actually use the string ""||"" as the separator. The uid is an opaque identifier of the user so I can look them up in the database.

The timestamp allows for a code to be expired.

I am using AES 256 in Galois Counter Mode which should provide protection from modified ciphertext attacks.

The encryption key is stored on the server, and used to perform the encryption.

The iv has a dual use. When the reset code is generated the iv is stored with the user in the database. This is used to enforce single-use of a reset code (it gets cleared when a reset code is processed) as well as prevent use of reset codes generated previously. If the iv in the database does not match the iv used to decrypt the reset code, the request is refused. This may also help with security in the event that the encryption key on the server is somehow compromised, as the attacker has to inject the iv into the database as well to make it work. Of course if the attacker is on the host we are pretty much toast...

They are saying that their useage is illegal due to discrimination laws in place for Disabled Citizens. 

I know OWASP is pretty good for info on security, but I have to question how serious the legality of implementing something like CAPTCHA is.

So. Can anyone reference or point me in the direction of any type of documentation confirming there is an issue of legality with using CAPTCHA? Is it specific to all countries or just U.S.?

Is implmementing speech features for the CAPTCHA enough to overcome the legality?

Extra points if you can find the relevant documents to support this in Canada. As I work in Canada for a large multinational company which uses CAPTCHA extensively.
