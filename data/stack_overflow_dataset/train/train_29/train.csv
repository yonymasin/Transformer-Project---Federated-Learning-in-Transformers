I've been wanting to switch to a Unix development environment forever.  Everything I do on Windows just doesn't feel as legitimate as programming in a shell, and I feel like there's an enormous body of programming knowledge that I'm missing out on.  I bought a new laptop and had planned on making an almost-complete operating system switch to Ubuntu Linux (I wanted to save Windows 7).

Unfortunately, the Ubuntu installation has proven extremely difficult.  I had a lot of problems.  Google, AskUbuntu, and the Ubuntu forums were unhelpful, and the #Ubuntu IRC channel was unfriendly, almost mocking.

I seem to have a couple options:
1.  I can go to Best Buy tomorrow and pay them a lot of money to do it for me.
2.  I could just use Windows normally and use a Virtual Machine whenever I wanted to code.
3.  I could try to emulate the Unix environment in Windows.

Any advice or suggestions?  I'm not sure where to go from here.  Here's what I've tried, in more detail:

-First, I tried directly dual booting Ubuntu 11.10 from the Live CD.  I got to the part where you partition your disk and couldn't figure it out.  First it wasn't showing anything, and then after an hour of Google searches I found a recommendation for what to type in the Terminal.  After I tried that, I could see the disks, but it was showing 2 separate hard drives, and the 450 GB partition had ""unknown"" for ""used"".  Nobody would help me figure out my problem, and I couldn't figure it out on my own.  Ubuntu was really laggy when I ran it off the Live CD.

-Next, I tried using Wubi.  It gave me an error when I tried to boot up.  I spent a couple hours and made some posts to try to figure out the error, and eventually realized it was due to the RAID setup (or lack thereof) in my computer, and the unspecified number of hard disks.  After calling HP tech support (useless) and using the #Ubuntu IRC channel (made me feel like an idiot), I gave up on that as well.

-I used VMWare, and hoped that I could just run the VirtualMachine all the time.  Unfortunately, this was way too slow, Banshee froze, even typing had like a half a second lagtime.  It was ridiculous.

One of my processes is making a lot of inserts into a MySQL database and it's bogging the whole server down.

MySQL is not using much of the CPU resources nor much of the RAM.  If that were the case I could use the tools 'nice' and 'ulimit' to throttle the process (in fact I am using nice on MySQL and it's not helping).  Instead, MySQL seems to be making lots of random disk read and write operations and so whenever anyone else wants to read or write a file from disk, they have to wait a second or two, which is not acceptable for interactive use.

Any thoughts on what I can do to limit MySQL's disk I/O?

This just occurred to me in answering another question.  Can anyone recommend any good, current, *systems programming* books, for really *any* variant of UNIX?  Such a book would teach file and directory structure, fork/exec, pipes, FIFOS, and semaphores.  I'd think (looking back on my similar course) that a reasonable final project would be writing a full shell, and possibly a lightweight HTTP daemon.

The *UNIX Programming Environment* by Kernighan and PIke comes closest, but is pretty old. ",2

I agree that it's probably a good idea. But for the sake of understanding the other options better, I'd like to narrow the scope a little bit.

Irrespective of what I plan to do with the files, how can I determine the most efficient and reliable method of retrieving from a Windows batch job files that are created by an AIX batch job, assuming I'm in control of both ends. The basic options I know of are sftp, scp and samba. I'm open to other options.

My criteria are as follows.

 - Reliability. From my experience (maybe just a problem in our systems) ftp jobs in batch are among the most frequent to fail. 
 - Security. Both servers are on the internal network, but the transfer still needs to be secure.
 - Maintainability. We have a fairly strict password expiration policy. So I'd like to minimize the number of different accounts and passwords.
 - Efficiency. The amount of data to be transferred in this specific case is small but not trivial. I'd be interested to know whether any of these approaches performs and scales better than the others.

Any suggestions or input will be appreciated.
