If you notice i am joining my elements with **let** keyword

some times my XML may not have all these elements.

So is it possible to join this element on if exits?
if not exists give a **null or empty** value for that field

for example if there is no **Pharmacy Element.**

then this  `let Pharmacy = MD.Element(NameSpace + ""Pharmacy"")`
should be possible and this 

    phStoreName = Pharmacy.Element(NameSpace + ""StoreName"").Value,
should give me a **null or empty** value for **phStoreName**

Or my question will be, which is the best xml parser for objective-c ?",5

The `<key>` element somehow describes entity classes fields and relationships (used in some other app that I don't have access to) and the `<value>` stores the actual data that I need.

My goal is to programatically generate a typed Dataset from this XML that could then be used for creating reports. I thought of building some XSD schema from input XML file first and then use this schema to generate Dataset but I'm not sure how to do that. The problem is that I don't want all data in one table, I need several tables with relationships based on the `<key>` value so I guess I need to infer relational structure from XML `<key>` data in some way.

So what do you think? How could this be done and what would be the best approach?

When I uncomment the 3 lines commented above, everything works:

![alt text][2]

But if I try to display the **pref.user.money** (instead of **pref.user.game**) in the List by running the code as it is listed above, then I get the error:

    TypeError: Error #1034: Type Coercion failed: 
    cannot convert 8815 to mx.collections.IList.

That is because there is an XML attribute **money=""8815""** above. But I don't want to display that attribute! I'd like to display the **money**-children of **user**.

Then I try to change the resultFormat of the HTTPService to ""e4x"" instead of the current ""object"", but then I get the error:

    TypeError: Error #1034: Type Coercion failed: 
    cannot convert XMLList@6180461 to mx.collections.IList.

Then I try to introduce a

    [Bindable]
    private var x:XML;

and assign fetched result to it, but get similar coercion errors. I've tried XMLList and XMLListCollection too.

And I would have preferred to use the View's **data** for storing the fetched result, because **data** is persisted, when I push another views and then later return back to the Home view again.

Any help please? Alex

For example

So the key is where there is data contained within **{}**

There's a few transformations being done, but eventually the end result will be displayed in a treeview. When a user then clicks on a node, I want to pop up the details in a listview.

When no node has been selected, I basically use LINQ to grab the details of the first item I encounter.

Here's a simplified version of my XML

    <root>
       <parent label=""parent1"">
          <child label=""child1"">
             <element1>data</element1>
             <element2>data</element2>
             ...

          <child label=""child2"">
             <element1>data</element1>
             <element2>data</element2>
             ...
          </child>
       </parent>
    </root>

And here's the code used to grab it (After selecting the parent-node that the treeview has been set to by means of an XPAthSelectStatement):

    protected void listsSource_Selecting(object sender, LinqDataSourceSelectEventArgs e) {
    XElement rootElement = XElement.Load(MapPath(TreeSource.DataFile));
    rootElement = rootElement.XPathSelectElement(""//parent[@label='parent1']"");
    XElement parentElement;

    parentElement = rootElement;

    var query = (from itemElement in parentElement.Descendants(""child"")
        select new {
           varElement1= itemElement.Element(""element1"").Value,
           varElement2= itemElement.Element(""element2"").Value,
    ...
    }).Take(1);

    e.result = Query;

This works a treat, and I can read out the ""varElement1"" and ""varElement2"" values from there. However, when I try and implement a similar mechanism for when the user actually did select a node, I seemt o run into a wall.

My approach was to use another XPatchSelectStatement to get to the actual node:

    parentElement = rootElement.XPathSelectElement(""//child[@label='"" + tvwChildren.SelectedNode.Text + ""']"");

But I am kind of stumped on how to now get a proper LINQ query built up to read in all elements nested under the child node. I tried using parentElement.Elements(), but that was not yielding anything in the query result. I also looked at using Nodes(), but with similar results. 

I suppose I could use a foreach loop to access the nodes, but then I'm not sure how to get the results into a LINQ query so I can return the same e.Result = query back.

I'm fairly new to LINQ, as you might have guessed, so any hints would be very much appreciated.

    <?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?>
    <BCLURLRestrictions>
    <restriction>
        <appName>app1</appName>
        <url>/apps/app1/</url>
        <page>app1.html</page>
        <page>app1b.html</page>
    </restriction>
    <restriction>
        <appName>app2</appName>
        <url>/apps/app2/</url>
        <page>app2.html</page>
    </restriction>
    </URLRestrictions>

11035872,06/14/2012 14:59:09,1456458,06/14/2012 14:12:09,1,0,Using multiple xml files in a xsl file in a webkit browser (client side transformation),"I am currently trying to get multiple xml files into my xsl file to then process them into useful html. This works fine for non webkit browsers but not for webkit browsers. 

I am using JavaScript to perform the transformation and it works fine across all browsers apart from if I want multiple xml files in it. 

I have tried various methods to try and get the extra xml files into the xsl, the files are all on the same server but in different folders.

1) I have tried adding the xml files directly as a variable. For example:

    <xsl:variable name=""structure"" select=""document('../structure.xml')""/> 

I have since found that webkit browsers do not allow this as it's considered a security risk. But if anyone is aware of any workarounds or different methods to achieve the same result that would be great

2) I have tried passing the xml file through into the processor as a parameter. Eg:
    
    xml=loadXMLDoc(""structure.xml);
    xsl=loadXMLDoc(""xsl/head.xsl"");
    structurexml =loadXMLDoc(""/extranet/structure.xml"");
    xsltProcessor =new XSLTProcessor();
    xsltProcessor.importStylesheet(xsl);
    xsltProcessor.setParameter(null, ""structure"", structurexml);
    process.transform();

loadXMLDoc is a simple piece of code that loads the xml and xsl files

    function loadXMLDoc(fname) {
	var isIE = (navigator.appName==""Microsoft Internet Explorer"");
	if (window.XMLHttpRequest) {
    	xhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
    }
    else {
      xhttp = new ActiveXObject('Microsoft.XMLHTTP');
    }
    xhttp.open('GET', fname, false);
    if (xhttp.overrideMimeType){
      xhttp.overrideMimeType('text/xml');   
	}
    xhttp.send(null);
    if (isIE) {
      xmlDoc = new ActiveXObject('Microsoft.XMLDOM');
      xmlDoc.async = false;
      xmlDoc.load(fname);
    }
    else {
      xmlDoc = xhttp.responseXML;
      if (!xmlDoc) {
        xmlDoc = (new DOMParser()).parseFromString(xhttp.responseText, 'text/xml');
      }
    }
    return xmlDoc;
    }

This doesn't work as webkit doesn't allow node-set as a parameter. Again any kind of work around would be brilliant

3) I have tried the above but transformed the xml into a string before adding as a parameter. This allows me to get the parameter to be passed through but then I can't get the string to be transformed back into xml to then process it. 

If anyone has any ideas about this that would also be great. 

The other option I have thought of is to use JavaScript to merge the xml files into one giant one and process this but I have no idea how to do that. 

Also I can't do server side processing as I do not have control of the server so I am left with only client side.

As I said before I can solve the problem for non webkit browsers. I have been trying to solve this problem for a while now and can't find any workarounds. I can't see that I can be the only person with this problem and really hope that someone has had a similar problem and found a workaround or fix for this.

Thanks in advance!

However this is only true for JSON as defined in [RFC 4329][1] which does not require uniqueness of object keys (many may not know but {""a"":1,""a"":2} is valid JSON!). But if you require unique keys in JSON or [unique attribute names in XML][2] this cannot be expressed by a context-free grammars. But which is the language class of JSON with unique keys and for well-formed XML (which implies unique attribute names?).

One of the best paper I found on this subject (Murato et al, 2001: [Taxonomy of XML Schema Languages using Formal Language Theory][3]) explicitly excludes integrity constraints such as keys/keyrefs and uniqueness to be checked on an additional layer. Beside this the subset of XML defined by an XML Schema or by a DTD is context-free. But not the full set of all well-formed XML documents.

I think a nested stack automaton (=indexed language) should be able to parse JSON with unique key constraint. For XML can simlify the question to the language S of all comma-seperated lists of unique integers. Does anyone know more, preferably with citations?

Currently, I am working in the beginning of a project where I want to authenticate / log in to a web site. Before I begin I want to make clear that [URL] in the code replaces the actual url of the web page.

So, I am trying to post login information by executing the following config:

    <config>
        <var-def name=""result"">

    </var-def>
    </config>

How do I retrieve the resulting information and follow the re-direction? When logging in manually the extension below is added to the URL. There seems to be some kind of randomisation and also a session id that is added. I suppose that is something I need to incorporate in my solution?

Is there a consensus on this sort of issue?

From a consuming client's perspective, I don't see too much difference.  Testing for the presence of the element shouldn't be any more complicated than checking the value of the element.

Also, I expect there may be up to a dozen or possibly two dozen of these type of parameters, so it's not like there would be hundreds or thousands of them.

Lastly, we intend for our API to be used with XML and JSON.  The JSON equivalent would be omitting the properties, and again from a consuming client perspective I see little difference between the two.
