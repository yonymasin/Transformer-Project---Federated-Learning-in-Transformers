The main problem is of course that I can't track down the reasons why Emacs crashes. Sometimes it crashes when I capture a new event in org-mode, today it crashed when I added an attachment to an open email in Gnus per drag-and-drop -- both tasks I frequently do without problems. The only hint I found is http://www.quora.com/How-can-I-find-the-cause-of-an-Emacs-crash-on-OS-X so it seems I am not alone.

Assume Emacs crashed and I reopened it. If I double-click a file in Finder (to be opened in Emacs), the file doesn't open. I rather get a buffer showing a file I loaded at some previous point in time. If I double-click the file in Finder again, it is then opened. I have to do this for every new file I would like to open. The simple solution is that after a crash I open Emacs, close it normally, and open it again. It then runs fine -- until the next crash :-)

In my MacHG repository view (the one where you can see the contents of each repo) there is a file called `rcurialOutput:`. This file only appears in the MacHG view. It does not appear in the finder or if you run `ls -a` from the terminal. If you select the file in MacHG the sidebar displays the file name (exactly as above), gives it's size as 0 bytes, and gives a modify and create date of `(null)`.

This file appears in every one of my repositories, regardless if are on my local disk, my Dropbox, or the NFS system where I works. I do not know if I can see the files on other operating systems.

If you try and commit this file, you get this error:

> Mercurial reported error number 255:  
> abort: rcurialOutput:: No such file or directory

This is annoying because I think have to select around the file and break up my commits to get all the files in. Deleting the file in MacHG does not make it go away.

The only clue I have is that for some reason my default commit ""signature"" is:

I'm planning to open source the code for this once its done, for anyone to use with their Core Data apps, so input from the community on how this system should work is much appreciated :-) Here's what I'm thinking:

Server Side
-
___

**Storage Provider**

As with all cloud sync systems, storage is a major piece of the puzzle. There are many ways to handle this. I could set up my own server for storage, or use a service like Amazon S3, but because I'm starting out with $0 capital, at this moment, a paid storage solution isn't a viable option. After some thought, I decided to settle with [Dropbox][1] (an already well established cloud sync application and storage provider). The pros of using Dropbox are:

 - It's free (for a limited amount of space)
 - In addition to being a storage service, it also handles cloud sync
 - They recently released an Objective-C SDK which makes it much easier to interface with it in Mac and iPhone apps

In case I decide to switch to a different storage provider in the future, I intend to add ""services"" to this cloud sync framework, basically allowing anyone to create a service class  to interface with their choice of storage provider, which can then simply be plugged into the framework.

**Storage Structure**

This is a really difficult part to figure out, so I need as much input as I can here. I've been thinking about a structure like this:

    CloudSyncFramework
    ======> [app name]
    ==========> devices

    ================> deviceinfo
    ================> changeset
    ==========> entities
    =============> (entity name)
    ================> (object id)

A quick explanation of this structure:

 - The master ""CloudSyncFramework"" (name undecided) folder will contain separate folders for each app that uses the framework
 - Each app folder contains a **devices** folder and an **entities** folder
 - The **devices** folder will contain a folder for each device that is registered with the account. The device folder will be named according to the device ID, obtained using something like `[[UIDevice currentDevice] uniqueIdentifier]` (on iOS) or a serial number (on Mac OS).
 - Each device folder contains two files: **deviceinfo** and **changeset**. **deviceinfo** contains information about the device (e.g. OS version, last sync date, model, etc.) and the **changeset** file contains information about objects that have changed since the device last synchronized. Both files will just be simple NSDictionaries archived into files using `NSKeyedArchiver`.
 - Each Core Data entity has a subfolder under the **entities** folder
 - Under each entity folder, every object that belongs to that entity will have a separate file. This file will contain a JSON dictionary with the key-value pairs.

**Simultaneous Sync**

This is one of the areas where I am almost completely clueless. **How would I handle 2 devices connecting and syncing with the cloud at the same time?** There seems to be a high risk of things getting out of sync here, or even data corruption. 

**Handling migrations**

Once again, another clueless area here. **How would I handle migrations of the Core Data managed object model?** The easiest thing to do here seems to be just to wipe the cloud data store clean and upload a new copy of the data from a device which has undergone the migration process, but this seems somewhat risky, and there may be a better way.

**Converting NSManagedObjects into JSON**

Converting attributes into JSON isn't a very hard task (theres lots of code for it floating around the web). Relationships are the key problem here. In [this][2] stackoverflow post, Marcus Zarra posts code in which the relationship objects themselves are added to the JSON dictionary. However, he mentions that this can cause an infinite loop depending on the structure of the model, and I'm not sure if this would work with my method, because I store each object as an individual file.

I've been trying to find a way to get an ID as a string for an `NSManagedObject`. Then I could save relationships in JSON as an array of IDs. The closest thing I found was `[[managedObject objectID] URIRepresentation]`, but this isn't really an ID for an object, its more of a location for the object in the persistent store, and I don't know if its concrete enough to use as a reference for an object.

I suppose I could generate a UUID string for each object and save it as an attribute, but I'm open for suggestions.

**Syncing changes to the cloud**

The first (and still best) solution that popped into my head for this was to listen for the `NSManagedObjectContextObjectsDidChangeNotification` to get a list of changed objects, then update/delete/insert those objects in the cloud data store. After the changes have been saved, I would need to update the **changeset** file for every other registered device to reflect the newly changed objects. 

One problem that comes up here is, **how would I handle a failed or interrupted sync?**. One idea I have is to first push changes to a temporary directory on the cloud, then once that has been confirmed as successful, to merge it with the master data on the cloud so that an interruption in the middle of the sync won't corrupt data. Then I would save records of the objects that need to be updated in the cloud into a plist file or something, to be pushed during the next time the app is connected to the internet.

**Retrieving changed objects**

This is fairly simple, the device downloads its **changeset** file, figures out which objects need to be updated/inserted/deleted, then acts accordingly.

And that sums up my thoughts for the logic that this system will use :-) Any insight, suggestions, answers to problems, etc. is *greatly* appreciated.

**Storage Provider**

As with all cloud sync systems, storage is a major piece of the puzzle. There are many ways to handle this. I could set up my own server for storage, or use a service like Amazon S3, but because I'm starting out with $0 capital, at this moment, a paid storage solution isn't a viable option. After some thought, I decided to settle with [Dropbox][1] (an already well established cloud sync application and storage provider). The pros of using Dropbox are:

 - It's free (for a limited amount of space)
 - In addition to being a storage service, it also handles cloud sync
 - They recently released an Objective-C SDK which makes it much easier to interface with it in Mac and iPhone apps

In case I decide to switch to a different storage provider in the future, I intend to add ""services"" to this cloud sync framework, basically allowing anyone to create a service class  to interface with their choice of storage provider, which can then simply be plugged into the framework.

**Storage Structure**

This is a really difficult part to figure out, so I need as much input as I can here. I've been thinking about a structure like this:

    CloudSyncFramework
    ======> [app name]
    ==========> devices
    =============> (device id)
    ================> deviceinfo
    ================> changeset
    ==========> entities
    =============> (entity name)
    ================> (object id)

A quick explanation of this structure:

 - The master ""CloudSyncFramework"" (name undecided) folder will contain separate folders for each app that uses the framework
 - Each app folder contains a **devices** folder and an **entities** folder
 - The **devices** folder will contain a folder for each device that is registered with the account. The device folder will be named according to the device ID, obtained using something like `[[UIDevice currentDevice] uniqueIdentifier]` (on iOS) or a serial number (on Mac OS).
 - Each device folder contains two files: **deviceinfo** and **changeset**. **deviceinfo** contains information about the device (e.g. OS version, last sync date, model, etc.) and the **changeset** file contains information about objects that have changed since the device last synchronized. Both files will just be simple NSDictionaries archived into files using `NSKeyedArchiver`.
 - Each Core Data entity has a subfolder under the **entities** folder
 - Under each entity folder, every object that belongs to that entity will have a separate file. This file will contain a JSON dictionary with the key-value pairs.

I'm asking this question in regards to both
 
Safari Extension (toolbar type AJAX extension)
Mac OS X dashboard widget
 
I assume both will be similar as they use the WebKit rendering engine?
 
I would like to know if the engine for maintaining built in session state support (cookies?) shares and persists the session between web content loaded on the page by the browser engine (HTML, JS, CSS, images, etc.) and requests made by XmlHttpRequest object.
 
I'm porting an AJAX app that requires session state that's shared between web content and XmlHttpRequest object. (i.e. no explicit cookie management for session state, at least not defined by the web service API that I use).
 
I successfully ported the app to Chrome, Opera, Windows 7/Vista gadget. It failed to work on iGoogle, and Mac OS X widget. Safari extension port had mixed results - it works in some cases but not in others.
 
I also did a Microsoft .HTA port (HTA app = web app to be run via IE w/o security restrictions of normal web apps, like cross domain XmlHttpRequests) and noticed that works only with IE7+ (due to implementation differences of native XmlHttpRequest in IE7+ vs MS XML version of earlier IEs)
 
I had consulted discussion/support group for iGoogle as well and learned that iGoogle too doesn't support such session state support.
 
I kind of worked around iGoogle issue by using Flash component to perform XmlHttpRequests which seemed to be able to share the overall browser session and thus work. I'm attempting that for Mac widget, it didn't seem to work. Can Safari toolbar extensions make use of Flash?
 
In any case posting this thread for more insight like if Safari/Mac is like iGoogle and not support a shared session between web content and XmlHttpRequest (or no cookies even supported).
 
FYI, the app I'm working on is below, you can try out what I have to investigate issue. When session state support fails, you get error message that need to enter code correctly (that's what the web service returns in this case, not very helpful to the user).

I also use a remote machine - it happens to be a Solaris 10 SPARC machine, about 1800 miles away - that can be called `xclient.subdom2.example.com` for the purposes of this question.

For better or worse - mostly worse - I use `xhost +xclient.subdom2.example.com` on the laptop to allow anyone who uses the remote machine to display their X client on my machine. Fortunately, I'm the only person who uses the Solaris machine on a regular basis and the corporate security is stringent enough that I can live with the security risks.

From the XP laptop, I then remotely connect to the X client machine, and set environment variable `DISPLAY=xplaptop.subdom1.example.com:0.0` and can run X client programs on the remote machine and see the display happily, if a little slowly on occasion, on the XP laptop.

I tried a tutorial on the web about manuall uninstallation, but after typing in the first command in terminal: ""sudo /sbin/SystemStarter stop postgresql-8.4"", terminal says: ""to proceed, enter your password"". Then after I've entered my old admin password (that I've allways used to log on my computer or in cases of installations) terminal just says: ""sorry, try again"". This is my main problem! My old admin password doesn't work for som reason after postgrsql got installed, and I have no idea what the new password might be, or how to find it out! Does anyone know how I might solve this so I can get trough with the uninstallation? Please help
