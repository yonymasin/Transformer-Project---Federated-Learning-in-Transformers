Fortunately, the Apple Store was able to boot into OSX using an USB thumbdrive. Unfortunately, I am having trouble finding a way to copy the files to my external G-tech (2TB) drive. The internal drive is on the latest leopard and the boot thumbdrive is OSX 10.6.8 .


NORMAL COPY VIA FINDER: Error 36

 - My dad didn't previously use timemachine or another backup method, so we tried to copy files and directories to an external. When we copied some directories, e.g. Pictures, we got an error -36: ""Can't complete the operation because some data in ""filename"" can't be read or written""

COPY FILES WITH TRY/EXCEPT in PYTHON: SUPER SLOW

 - Wrote a quick script to move files from internal to external, using except to catch copy errors, but the script became super slow: taking 10min per 4mb photo file sometimes. The script was fast on my other computer, where I copied the files to and from the same Hard Disk, making me think that copying from an internal HD to an External while booting from a thumbdrive may be slowing the system down.

Time Machine: Slow
 
- Now we are using time machine to back up the entire internal disk to the external, but it seems to be very slow, transferring about 1GB per 10 minutes. At this rate, it may take 53 hours for 320 GB. This seems to be slow...




Is this(time machine) the only way besides manually dragging single files? The Moral is clearly that he should have been backing files up regularly, but now that the damage is done, what can I do to speed up the copy?

Do uninstall WordPress and start afresh or what? Or is there any less torturous practical way to resolve this? Already talked with BlueHost Support. Said it suppose to work all fine.

The JIT works pretty good, just needs some additional op codes and some kind of GC. Now, I'm thinking of making something like Lua, but with some IDE and visual editor. Currently the code generation is quite simple. I have a template executable written in C, which holds the JIT. The high level compiler patches the executable with the generated bytecode. That makes the whole generation process as easy as possible. Currently I have only PE32 template, but the idea was to make also PE64 and MacOS and Linux formats. All fine, but I don't want to rewrite all libraries for every OS and also I need some GUI.

**Here's what I currently have:**

 - A simple stack-based JIT written in C, without GC and without good opcode specification (I can change it after some time)
 - A simple compiler written in C++ using [Coco/R][1] (a compiler generator)
 - Some knowledge in C, C++, WINAPI, IA32, JITs, reverse engineering

**What I need:**

 - OS API libs - I'll use the C standard library, but there are still things that it doesn't cover. I'm searching for language from which I can translate the libs to my code. It should have most of the things: files, threads, process operations, sockets, etc. For translating, it's preferably to be a bytecode language, so I can easily translate it to mine bytecode. I saw Lua's libs, but it used external DLLs which I try to avoid. I'm wondering for Java, since it has simple bytecode.
 - A simple way for *native-looking* GUI, without megabytes of bloat (like Qt) - I was thinking for using a web browser window and JavaScript/CSS. Since web pages are truly portable and there are so much JavaScript controls these days.



Few additional questions about OSX:

I heard there is ObjC++ for MacOS, does it have enough examples to learn?

Can I use CocoaJS for a bridge to create Cocoa apps on MacOS?

Everything works perfectly fine if I attempt to make use of Apple's default units like the DLS Synth and various effects. However, my application seems to be unable to find any third-party Audio Units (in /Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Components).

For example, the following code snippet...
    
    CAComponentDescription tInstrumentDesc = 
         CAComponentDescription('aumu','dls ','appl');
    
    AUGraphAddNode(mGraph, &tInstrumentDesc, &mInstrumentNode);

    AUGraphOpen(mGraph);

...works just fine. However, if I instead initialize `tInstrumentDesc` with `'aumu', 'NiMa', '-Ni-'` (the description for Native Instruments' Massive Synth), then `AUGraphOpen()` will return the `OSStatus` error `badComponentType` and the AUGraph will fail to open. This holds true for all of my third party Audio Units.

The following code, modified from the Audacity source, sheds a little light on the problem. It loops through all of the available Audio Units of a certain type and prints out their name.

    ComponentDescription d;
		
    d.componentType = 'aumu';
    d.componentSubType = 0;
    d.componentManufacturer = 0;
    d.componentFlags = 0;
    d.componentFlagsMask = 0;
		
    Component c = FindNextComponent(NULL, &d);
    while(c != NULL)
    {
        ComponentDescription found;
			
        Handle nameHandle = NewHandle(0);
			
        GetComponentInfo(c, &found, nameHandle, 0, 0);
			
        printf((*nameHandle)+1);
        printf(""\n"");
			
        c = FindNextComponent(c, &d);
    }

After running this code, the only output is `Apple: DLSMusicDevice` (which is the Audio Unit fitting the description `'aumu', 'dls ', 'appl'` above).

This doesn't seem to be a problem with the units themselves, as Apple's `auval` tool lists my third party Units (they validate too).

However, if I instead initialize `tInstrumentDesc` with `'aumu', 'NiMa', '-Ni-'` (the description for Native Instruments' Massive Synth), then `AUGraphOpen()` will return the `OSStatus` error `badComponentType` and the AUGraph will fail to open. This holds true for all of my third party Audio Units.

The following code, modified from the Audacity source, sheds a little light on the problem. It loops through all of the available Audio Units of a certain type and prints out their name.

    ComponentDescription d;
		
    d.componentType = 'aumu';
    d.componentSubType = 0;
    d.componentManufacturer = 0;
    d.componentFlags = 0;
    d.componentFlagsMask = 0;
		
    Component c = FindNextComponent(NULL, &d);
    while(c != NULL)
    {
        ComponentDescription found;
			
        Handle nameHandle = NewHandle(0);
			
        GetComponentInfo(c, &found, nameHandle, 0, 0);
			
        printf((*nameHandle)+1);
        printf(""\n"");
			
        c = FindNextComponent(c, &d);
    }

After running this code, the only output is `Apple: DLSMusicDevice` (which is the Audio Unit fitting the description `'aumu', 'dls ', 'appl'` above).

This doesn't seem to be a problem with the units themselves, as Apple's `auval` tool lists my third party Units (they validate too).

I've tried running my test application with `sudo`, and the custom framework I'm working on is in /Library/Frameworks.",4

I'm used to Netbeans and having already installed MAMP attempted a Netbeans install, which promptly failed. Has anybody had a similar experience and can point me in the right direction, It informs me that I can't install it as I need an OS 10.4.x.... which I do.

Failing that, Can anybody suggest a good alternative.
I program,
HTML, CSS, PHP and JQuery and enjoyed the debugging facilities in Netbean as well as it's layout (database connections, multi-panel windows)

</blockquote>",osx,flash-builder,trial,,,09/21/2011 14:02:57,off topic,1,618,8,"Difficulties installing Flash Builder (trial) on a Mac So I just installed the trial version of Flash Builder on my Mac.  When I launch the app, it also launches the Adobe Application Manager, which allows me to continue my trial.  Then Flash Builder crashes and spits the following into the log file.  Any idea what I can do to help Adobe avoid disposing of that widget too early?

In my previous question **http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9847696/open-a-file-from-a-specific-program-from-python**, I found out how to use subprocess in order to open a program (Blender) - well, a specific .blend file - from a specific file path with this code.

    import os
    import subprocess
    
    path = os.getcwd()
    os.system(""cd path/"")
    subprocess.check_call([""open"", ""-a"", os.path.join(path, ""blender.app""),""Import_mhx.blend""])

With the help of a guy, http://blenderartists.org/forum/showthread.php?249698-Absolute-Paths-in-Blender&highlight= , I wanted to use Relative paths inside the .blend file, so I changed the code in this way (for windows)

    import os
    import subprocess
    
    # This should be the full path to your Blender executable.
    blenderPath = ""/cygdrive/c/Program Files/Blender Foundation/blender-2.62-release-windows32/blender.exe""
    
    # This is the directory that you want to be your ""current"" directory when Blender starts
    path1 = ""/Users/user/Desktop/scenario/Blender""
    
    # This makes makes it so your script is currently based at ""path1""
    os.chdir(path1)
    
    subprocess.check_call([blenderPath, ""Import_mhx.blend""])

for mac

    import os
    import subprocess
    
    path = os.getcwd()
    os.system(""cd path/"")
    print (path)
    # This should be the full path to your Blender executable.
    blenderPath = path + ""/blender.app/Contents/macos/blender""
    
    # This is the directory that you want to be your ""current"" directory when Blender starts
    path1 = ""/Users/user/Desktop/scenario/Blender""
    
    # This makes makes it so your script is currently based at ""path1""
    os.chdir(path1)
    
    subprocess.check_call([blenderPath, ""Import_mhx.blend""])

Results:

1. In windows, it works fine
2. In mac, the result is that the file is opened, but the program seems not to be opened. It is quite strange I think.

Questions: 

1. Is there any extension that I should place for the blender (UNIX executable file) in order for it to open?
2. Is there any other way that I can do it in order to open the program correctly, but also being able to use relative paths inside .blend file?

Feel free to ask me explain smth more specifically:)
Thanks in advance

I have turned on web sharing in settings, and I am positive that I have perl installed but I can't get it to run properly. I think it has something to do with either my `httpd.conf` file or where I am putting my script files.  I've posted my httpd.conf file below (sorry that it's so long or if its against stack overflow  rules to post something so long.) 

Two questions. First, does my httpd.conf file look correct (I've followed some online tutorials but they were incomplete so it might be messed up slightly). Second, if the file is correct, where should I put my scripts in order to make them run properly?  In order to test this out I've been pointing my browser at `http://localhost/first.cgi` and currently I am getting a 403 forbidden error; however, in the past I have gotten 404 not found errors. Help would be very much appreciated

    # This is the main Apache HTTP server configuration file.  It contains the

    # See <URL:http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2> for detailed information.
    # In particular, see 
    # <URL:http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/directives.html>
    # for a discussion of each configuration directive.
    #
    # Do NOT simply read the instructions in here without understanding
    # what they do.  They're here only as hints or reminders.  If you are unsure
    # consult the online docs. You have been warned.  
    #
    # Configuration and logfile names: If the filenames you specify for many
    # of the server's control files begin with ""/"" (or ""drive:/"" for Win32), the
    # server will use that explicit path.  If the filenames do *not* begin
    # with ""/"", the value of ServerRoot is prepended -- so ""logs/foo_log""
    # with ServerRoot set to ""/opt/local/apache2"" will be interpreted by the
    # server as ""/opt/local/apache2/logs/foo_log"".
    
    #
    # ServerRoot: The top of the directory tree under which the server's
    # configuration, error, and log files are kept.
    #
    # Do not add a slash at the end of the directory path.  If you point
    # ServerRoot at a non-local disk, be sure to point the LockFile directive
    # at a local disk.  If you wish to share the same ServerRoot for multiple

",osx,perl,apache,cgi,,07/12/2012 00:40:16,off topic,1,4600,10,"Need help running CGI scripts on Mac OS X Apache I'm trying to run a simple CGI perl script (see below) using Apache on my Macbook running OS X Lion and I'm having difficulty getting it to run even the simplest of scripts.  I have turned on web sharing in settings, and I am positive that I have perl installed but I can't get it to run properly. I think it has something to do with either my `httpd.conf` file or where I am putting my script files.  I've posted my httpd.conf file below (sorry that it's so long or if its against stack overflow  rules to post something so long.) 

Two questions. First, does my httpd.conf file look correct (I've followed some online tutorials but they were incomplete so it might be messed up slightly). Second, if the file is correct, where should I put my scripts in order to make them run properly?  In order to test this out I've been pointing my browser at `http://localhost/first.cgi` and currently I am getting a 403 forbidden error; however, in the past I have gotten 404 not found errors. Help would be very much appreciated

Program that I'm trying to run saved as `first.cgi`

    #!/usr/bin/perl -wT
    print ""Content-type: text/html\n\n"";
    print ""<h2>Hello, World!</h2>\n"";

    # This is the main Apache HTTP server configuration file.  It contains the
    # configuration directives that give the server its instructions.
    # See <URL:http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2> for detailed information.
    # In particular, see 
    # <URL:http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/directives.html>
    # for a discussion of each configuration directive.
    #
    # Do NOT simply read the instructions in here without understanding
    # what they do.  They're here only as hints or reminders.  If you are unsure
    # consult the online docs. You have been warned.  
    #
    # Configuration and logfile names: If the filenames you specify for many
    # of the server's control files begin with ""/"" (or ""drive:/"" for Win32), the
    # server will use that explicit path.  If the filenames do *not* begin
    # with ""/"", the value of ServerRoot is prepended -- so ""logs/foo_log""
    # with ServerRoot set to ""/opt/local/apache2"" will be interpreted by the
    # server as ""/opt/local/apache2/logs/foo_log"".
    
    #
    # ServerRoot: The top of the directory tree under which the server's
    # configuration, error, and log files are kept.
    #
    # Do not add a slash at the end of the directory path.  If you point
    # ServerRoot at a non-local disk, be sure to point the LockFile directive
    # at a local disk.  If you wish to share the same ServerRoot for multiple
    # httpd daemons, you will need to change at least LockFile and PidFile.
    #
    ServerRoot ""/opt/local/apache2""
    
    #
    # Listen: Allows you to bind Apache to specific IP addresses and/or
    # ports, instead of the default. See also the <VirtualHost>
    # directive.

    # Change this to Listen on specific IP addresses as shown below to

So, as you can see my machine has `fe80::216:cbff:fe94:1a79` address on `en0` interface. Also,

    $ ping6 fe80::216:cbff:fe94:1a79%en0
    PING6(56=40+8+8 bytes) fe80::216:cbff:fe94:1a79%en0 --> fe80::216:cbff:fe94:1a79%en0
    16 bytes from fe80::216:cbff:fe94:1a79%en0, icmp_seq=0 hlim=64 time=0.153 ms
    ^C
    --- fe80::216:cbff:fe94:1a79%en0 ping6 statistics ---
    1 packets transmitted, 1 packets received, 0.0% packet loss
    round-trip min/avg/max/std-dev = 0.153/0.153/0.153/0.000 ms
    
    $

But why

    $ ping6 fe80::216:cbff:fe94:1a79
    ping6: UDP connect: No route to host
    $ 

fails? Is it possible to access the remote machine without typing an interface name `%en0`?

May be it is a very basic question because I am not a powerful IPv6 user.
