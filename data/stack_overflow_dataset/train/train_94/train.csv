I just realised how much I'd learn from that practice, I'd love to **profile myself!**

However I really don't think it'd be very effective to record the screen (as in video) especially because Visual Studio is already *unbearably slow* and besides it'd be boring to seek the video in a player. 

Instead, it would be really awesome to have some plugin that could record what I've coded (so not the debugging and visual designer, etc) and could play it back for me to see how much I suck and where.

Is this possible?

Which outputs notes to the output pane in Visual Studio 2005.  When 'TRIAGE_MESG_AS_WARNING' is defined, Visual Studio will harvest these messages and list them as warnings in the Error List.  It does this because the text format matches a warning.   However, I don't want them to show up as warnings all the time, I would rather they show up in the Messages pane of the Error List.

What do I need to do to get the output to show up in the Messages pane of the Error List?  The format I have setup for messages in the above code looks like a message from other output, but does not get harvested in the same way.

When I run unit tests on my Visual Studio 2008 SP1 without debugging, everything is fine. But when I debug them, Visual Studio hangs most of the time. The GUI-context never switches to debug mode and the test hangs as pending.

 - VSTesthost hangs at 0% CPU, not 100%.
 - Debugging doesn't even start. The reports I found mention that it hangs when executing the last statement, but I can't get it that far.

**A brief overview:**
10 developers -
Currently no source control -
All using Visual Studio 2010 Professional    

**Needs:**
Source Control (Version Control) -
Code Review -
Logging for everything (PCI) -
Build Control -
Bug Logging (QA access / queue bug severity/issues a bonus) -
Moderate Budget ($50-$200) a month -
Unit/Integration testing -
Ease of integration with VS 


The first thing that came to mind was something I was familiar with from a previous workplace, Team Foundation Server. This is basically everything in a nutshell that we need.
Of course the price is way out of our range.

The next solution I looked at was Jira/fisheye/crucible/bamboo/perforce which does look promising. 

I would really appreciate any experiences those have had in the past setting up a system similar to the one I'm looking for.

The way we currently develop would be best described as one developer per application. With the growth of the company we're now finding many developers working on the same project which you can imagine without source control can be a nightmare. With applications falling within the realm of PCI compliance we also have to make sure those rules are addressed in our solution. Needless to say passing keys around to each other to get the latest is not a viable solution.

On a side note we need to implement db source control too. This would be phase to of our SC deployment so if there's a solution out there that addresses this too that would be fantastic. Thank you all very much for your time and help!

My personal feeling is that any sort of silly trick to simplify code only acts to encourage terrible coding behavior, like lack of cohesion, unclear intention and poor or incomplete coding standards.

One programmer told me that code regions helped encourage coding standards by making it clear where another programmer should put his or her contributions. 

But, to be blunt, this sounds like a load of horse manure to me. If you have a standard, it is the programmer's job to understand what that standard is... you should't need to define it in every single class file.

And, nothing is more annoying than having all of your code collapsed when you open a file. I know that cntrl + M, L will open everything up, but then you have the hideous ""hash region definition"" open and closing lines to read.

They're just irritating.

My most stead fast coding philosophy is that all programmer should strive to create clear, concise and cohesive code. Region tags just serve to create noise and redundant intentions.

I had everything up and running for months then one day, I was forced by our AD policy to change my password and the remote debugging has not worked since.

I have a Windows 2003 server running virtually (MS Virtual PC 2007) on the same system that I run my Visual Studio 2005 IDE from (Windows XP Pro).  Both systems are members of the same domain and my domain account is in the admin group of both systems.  I’m logged into the XP machine running Visual Studio and the Windows server running the Debug Console using this domain account. 

When I try to attach to the remote debugger from within VS I get an error after about 1 minute… “Unable to connect to the Microsoft Visual Studio Remote Debugging Monitor and ‘myServer’.  This operation returned because the timeout period expired.”  

When attaching from VS, I have used just the server name as well as the full debug server instance name (Domain\user@myServer) that is listed in the console but I get the same results.  I have also tried running the console as a service using my domain account (this is the original way I had it setup) and from a share on the XP PC running VS….again same results.  I also checked the permissions on the Debug Console and both the admin group as well as my domain account are listed and Debug is set to “Allow” for both.

When I try to attach to the debugger from within VS I can see the connection popup on the Remote Debug Console of the server and it says it’s connected but I noticed that it’s trying to connect as a different user than what I’m logged into either machine as.  The debug console shows the connection belongs to a local account (myServer\user1)… I would expect to see Domain\User.  The local account that shows in the debug console does exist locally on both systems and is in the local admin group on each system but I have no idea why it would all of a sudden try to use that account rather than the domain account I’m logged in as on both systems.


As I mentioned, everything was working for months and only seem to stop functioning after the AD account password was changed.

Does anyone have any ideas on what could be causing this issue?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks!

Here are a few of mine:

Control+minus : goes back to the previous editor position. This is especially helpful if you have temporarily navigated away from your editting position because you've looked up a symbol declaration or searched for a string. It works between files too. Control+Shift+minus visits the editor positions in the opposite direction.

The ability to unload projects and then to edit them using the text editor. You do this by right-clicking on a project and selecting ""Unload Project"", the right-clicking on the project and select ""Edit project"". Sometimes editing the text of the project files is faster than carrying out operations using the gui. For example, having to copy a long list of references from one project to another. Once the editing is done, you right-click on the project and select ""Load Project"" to return to the normal project view.

Dragging the current location marker in the source window during a debug session to skip statements or re-execute statements. In the debugger the yellow ""current statement"" arrow is draggable. 

Executing C# statements interactively in the debugger using the Immediate Window. You can type statements into the Immediate window of the debugger, and it will execute them in the context of the current statement. Of course, only statements that make sense in the context of the current statement will execute.

In C++, a really handy thing to have is to open the ""Code Definition Window"". So no matter what .cpp file you are editing, the corresponding .h window is displayed in this extra window.
