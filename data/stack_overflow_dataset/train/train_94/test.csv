These files include [project templates][2] for the ""New Project"" dialog.

By experimenting, I found that I can successfully add the project templates and get them to show up in the dialog if I simply copy them into `C:\Program Files (x86)\Atmel\AVR Studio 5.0\ProjectTemplates\` and then delete or rename `C:\Program Files (x86)\Atmel\AVR Studio 5.0\ProjectTemplateCache\cache.bin`.

It seems to contain the same files as the ProjectTemplates folder, plus the cache.bin file, so I'm not sure why it would be useful.  After I rename cache.bin, Visual Studio does *not* regenerate it, which makes me worried that renaming it might have some permanent consequences.  **Is renaming cache.bin a bad idea?  What problems can it cause?**

**Is there another, easy way to install new project templates?**  Ideally I would like something that is easier than creating a Visual Studio Extension (.vsix) file, as recommended in this previous StackOverflow question: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2102605/installing-a-custom-project-template-with-visual-studio-installer-project

I've been using Delphi since version 2, and since moving up to around v5/v6, I've never upgraded to get newer features - but instead to get around bugs in the IDE/compiler.  Today, I opened up a personal project that I've been working on occasionally for the past year and it wouldn't compile (having not been changed at all since last time).  Eventually it compiled but wouldn't run.........

I've been using C# / visual studio quite a lot for work and quick'n'dirty projects and the only problems I've come across with C#/VS are limitations of the C# language itself.


**The question:**

Is there some way that I can edit my Delphi projects within Visual Studio and run/debug them from there, instead of having to use the Delphi IDE/debugger with all its numerous bugs?  I really don't want to have to upgrade Delphi again purely to get around Borland's heisenbugs.

I saw some LGPL'd project to get Delphi into visual studio but it seemed to be dead as of 2007.  Likewise, I've seen Delphi .NET in visual studio, but some of my scientific code is heavily ASM optimised (SSE/FMA).


Alternatively, is there a decent (and free/cheap) Delphi=>C++ / Delphi=>C# translator program around?  If I can just have my Delphi code translated to a Visual Studio language (give or take the occasional bit of ASM), that would probably suffice.

I've been using Delphi since version 2, and since moving up to around v5/v6, I've never upgraded to get newer features - but instead to get around bugs in the IDE/compiler.  Today, I opened up a personal project that I've been working on occasionally for the past year and it wouldn't compile (having not been changed at all since last time).  Eventually it compiled but wouldn't run.........

I've been using C# / visual studio quite a lot for work and quick'n'dirty projects and the only problems I've come across with C#/VS are limitations of the C# language itself.


**The question:**

Is there some way that I can edit my Delphi projects within Visual Studio and run/debug them from there, instead of having to use the Delphi IDE/debugger with all its numerous bugs?  I really don't want to have to upgrade Delphi again purely to get around Borland's heisenbugs.

I saw some LGPL'd project to get Delphi into visual studio but it seemed to be dead as of 2007.  Likewise, I've seen Delphi .NET in visual studio, but some of my scientific code is heavily ASM optimised (SSE/FMA).


Alternatively, is there a decent (and free/cheap) Delphi=>C++ / Delphi=>C# translator program around?  If I can just have my Delphi code translated to a Visual Studio language (give or take the occasional bit of ASM), that would probably suffice.



    Thanks,
      Mark",3
