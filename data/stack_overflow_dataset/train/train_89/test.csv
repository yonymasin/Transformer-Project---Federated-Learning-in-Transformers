To sum up his argument:  The code doesn't get rusty, and while it may not look pretty after many maintenance releases, if it works, it works.  The end user doens't care how pretty the code is.

You can read the article here: [Things You Should Never Do][1]

I've recently taken over a project and after looking through their code, it's pretty awful.  I immediately thought of prototypes I had built before, and explicitly stated that it should not be used for any production environment.  But of course, people don't listen.

The code is built as a website, has no separation of concerns, no unit testing, and code duplication everywhere. No Data layer, no real business logic, unless you count a bunch of classes in App_Code.

I've made the recommendation to the stake holders that, while we should keep the existing code, and do bug fix releases, and some minor feature releases, we should start rewriting it immediately with Test Driven Development in mind and with clear separation of concerns.  I'm thinking of going the ASP.NET MVC route.

My only concern is of course, the length of time it might take to rewrite from scratch.  It's not entirely complicated, pretty run of the mill web application with membership, etc..

Have any of you come across a similar problem?  Any particular steps you took?

Thanks a bunch!

If a development team creates an extensive framework, and many (20-30) applications consume it, and the business would like application updates at least every 30 days, what is the best deployment strategy?

The reason I ask is that there seems to be a lot of waste (and risk) in using an agile approach of deploying changes monthly, if 90% of the applications don't change. What I mean by this is that the framework can change during the month, and so can a few applications. Because the framework changed, all applications should be regression-tested. If, say, 10 of the applications don't change at all during the year, then those 10 applications are regression-tested EVERY MONTH, when they didn't have any feature changes or hot fixes. They had to be tested simply because the business is rolling updates every month.

And the risk that is involved... if a mission-critical application is deployed, that takes a few weeks, and multiple departments, to test, is it realistic to expect to have to constantly regression-test this application?

One option is to make any framework updates backward-compatible. While this would mean that applications don't need to change their code, they would still need to be tested because the underlying framework changed. And the risk involved is great; a constantly changing framework (and deploying this framework) means the mission-critical app can never just enjoy the same code base for a long time.

These applications share the same database, hence the need for the constant testing. I'm aware of TDD and automated tests, but that doesn't exist at the moment.

 - create test cases for a piece of code / API
 - categorize each test i.e. functional, stress, load, performance, security etc.
 - prioritize (assuming low / medium / high priorities)

I want to gather up ideas for such test cases. We can assume a normal application, so if the question is for a shuttle controller, the priority for stress testing would be considerably higher. You can start from a C++ piece of code, like: 

    char* reverseString(char* myString) { //some implementation }

or some modern code (C#, Java)

    string Reverse() { //some implementation }


Here are some of my ideas:

 - [functional, high] if testing strings or some other form of a collection, see if the code works for a collection with even number of elements, odd number, special elements within (spaces for strings), single element and a combination of these 
 - [functional, high] test to fail - empty string, NULL pointer, very large string, non null terminated string
 - [functional, high] check the documentation 
 - [functional, high] for the C version, using char means this will work only on ANSII strings - use wchar_t instead.


----------

 - [stress, low] pass in a pointer to a protected memory area
 - [stress, low] big endian vs little endian 

----------


 - [security, high] for C++, check the code for buffer overruns


----------


 - [performance, medium] check that the algorithm's complexity is low
 - [performance, high] if there are some ""service level agreements"" (e.g. the reverse function should return the value in maximum 5 seconds), test them with a high priority
 - [performance, low] check for memory leaks by running the code many times and measuring the memory used each time (this is also relevant to C# where we can have event leaks, static data leaks, resource leaks etc. but the testing methodology is a little different because the GC is non-deterministic)

----------


 - [usability, low] if stress testing reveals limits, make sure these limits are enforced and proper errors are given (e.g. if you cannot reverse a string larger than 2 Gb of data, the user should be informed)
 - [usability, high] the code should be consistent with the rest of the API, for example when handling errors (exceptions, error codes)
 

----------

 - [localization, high] - random inputs of UTF-8 and ANSII strings 
 - [localization, low] - should work on a machine with the OS in another language

 - [regression , low] - record some data (e.g. time to reverse some words) as baseline and check them every time some changes are made

Basically:  We have a JSON API that returns a friends list.  The result looks something like:

    [{""name"":""Bob"", ""uid"":12345, ""level"":4}, {""name"":""George"", ""uid"":23456, ""level"":6}]

There are the normal sort of ""mutual friend"" requirements in place, that influence the response.

The disagreement is basically over which is better,

        def test_results_are_sorted_by_name():
            .. <setup 2 friends> ..
