My understanding is unit tests:

- validate the system from the developer's point of view

My problem is Rake loads the Rails system in order to find my tasks in my gem. So by the time it gets to my tasks Rails is already loaded in the ""development"" environment (or whatever environment the user specified). This means in order to run my rake tasks properly the user must do:

    RAILS_ENV=test rake mytask

Since my task only make sense in the ""test"" environment this is annoying as I would much rather the user be able to just type:

    rake mytask

This is similar to how test:units and test:functionals automatically assume the test environment and the user doesn't need to specify RAILS_ENV=test at the command line. So the question is how do I modify my test so that Rails switches to the test environment?

    Rails.env = 'test'
    ActionMailer::Base.delivery_method = :test
    require Rails.root.join('test/test_helper')

This seems to somewhat work but it is still logging to log/development.log and I think it is still actually running the ""development"" config. Anybody have any ideas? Looking at how the test tasks are defined in Rails itself doesn't reveal how to do it that I can see.

My current workaround is:

    Rails.env = 'test'
    ActionMailer::Base.delivery_method = :test
    require Rails.root.join('test/test_helper')

This seems to somewhat work but it is still logging to log/development.log and I think it is still actually running the ""development"" config. Anybody have any ideas? Looking at how the test tasks are defined in Rails itself doesn't reveal how to do it that I can see.

    deps = [
       ""lib/backbone"", ""models/websocket_collection"", ""/static/js/lib/date.js""
    ]
    
    define(deps, (Backbone, ws) ->
        # module code and exports here

And loaded into the browser like so:

    <script type=""text/javascript"" charset=""utf-8"" async="""" data-requirecontext=""_"" data-requiremodule=""my_mod"" src=""/static/js/my_mod.js""></script>

    {Model1, Model2} = require ""models/some_module""
    
    exports.test_a = ->
        assert.equal # etc etc

I have several problems (having not really used node server side except when I played with zombie.js)

 1. How do I tell node where all of my plain javascript dependencies are (in static/js/lib) some of these are as downloaded, but backbone.js has been marked up with require.js define stuff like so:
  

    define(function(require, exports, module) {
        (function(){
 2. How do I actually run the tests? I've tried r.js (which as I understand it is supposed to be a bridge between browser side require and node's require)

the problem I'm getting is:

    ReferenceError: define is not defined

I've also tried to require(""allplugins-require"") which is the script I load browser side to collect all of my client code, but that seems to break node's require.

 - Is anybody doing this?
 - If you're not doing this how are you testing your code (bonus points for integration with CI)?
 - Any alternatives to require.js for managing client side dependencies that might play a bit better on the server side?

I'd be very happy to hear alternative approaches that people are using.

Thanks,
Ben

So any other ideas??

Thanks

Over the years of my professional career I've seen very little systematic testing done on real life projects. Especially bespoke projects. Even though projects were very complex, no actual testing was done. At least not properly as we've learned.

I estimate that **only about 10%** of projects are actually methodically tested where there are dedicated testers part of the team and developers write automated tests (unit, integration, regression etc. tests).

I would like to ask some questions about your estimates and experience:

1. What percentage of projects (estimated) you've been working on have been systematically tested - using a dedicated tester testing stuff while it's being written; writing unit/integration/regression/other automated tests; test coverage tracking; test result measurement etc.
2. Which type of projects are normally methodically tested:
    * projects for particular clients (bespoke)
    * general projects that will be sold afterwards
3. Which industry aimed projects are normally methodically tested? (Finance, IT, etc.)
4. What's the minimum project size (in terms of team size) when projects start being methodically tested.

There are even more questions I'd like to ask and are collected in a nice [Google questionnaire](https://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=dHhUU2xIRERwSklhU3FfQnJzdnlPcXc6MQ). I'd also be very grateful if you'd take the time (3-5 minutes) to complete the questionnaire.

So is there another term ""Unit Testing"" that just means really doing QA type of testing?  Isn't that called ""Black Box"" testing?

I think this team is using the word Unit Testing wrong.  We're not doing code unit testing in the sense such as writing code to test code (TDD, etc.)

So are they stupid to call it ""Unit Testing"" when you have other devs going over the functionality?  A code review is soemthing else, not what we're doing here.",1

I've picked up bits and pieces as to what the problem alludes to but haven't yet pieced it all together. 

One rather dark version of the problem goes a little something like this:
An island has 100 inhabitants. Each of the inhabitants has either green or blue eyes. None of the inhabitants are allowed to communicate with each other to let them know what color eyes they have, nor are there any reflective surfaces in which the inhabitants can see their own eye colors. Basically everyone knows what color eyes everyone has but none of them know what color eyes they themselves have. The rule on the island is that if you find out that you have blue eyes you must kill yourself. The island's population remains stable until one day an oracle arrives and tells the inhabitants that two people on the island have blue eyes.

The question is what happens to the people?

An answer I found is that 1000 days later the last person on the island kills themselves.

I have no clue how this makes sense and I was hoping that someone could help relate this problem back to software testing. Thanks for coming on the journey and I look forward to some interesting responses.

and here is the code junit test that they gave me.

    package test;

    import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;


    import java.util.Collections;
    import java.util.LinkedList;
    import java.util.List;

    import org.junit.Test;

    import safe.SafetyException;
    import safe.SafetyInspector;


    public class SafetyInspectorTest {
	@Test
	public void testIsSafeEmployee() throws SafetyException {
		assertEquals(false, SafetyInspector.isSafe(Employee.class));
	}
	
	@Test
	public void testResetEmployee() throws SafetyException {
		Employee e = new Employee(123,3000);
		SafetyInspector.reset(e);
		assertEquals(0, e.id);
		assertEquals(3000, e.getSalary());
	}
	
	@Test
	public void testSort() throws SafetyException {
		List<Class<?>> sortedClasses = new LinkedList<Class<?>>();
		sortedClasses.add(Employee.class);
		List<Class<?>> classes = new LinkedList<Class<?>>(sortedClasses);
		Collections.shuffle(classes);
		SafetyInspector.sort(classes);
		assertEquals(sortedClasses, classes);
	}	
    }


and when I run the safetyInspectorTest as a junitTESTCLASS i get an initialization error. I work with eclipse if it helps and I put Junit as a library of the project.
