Equation A)
<pre>
    PR(A) = 0.5 + 0.5 PR(C) 
    PR(B) = 0.5 + 0.5 (PR(A) / 2)
    PR(C) = 0.5 + 0.5 (PR(A) / 2 + PR(B))
</pre>

and it comes up with the result 

Result B)
<pre>
    PR(A) = 14/13 = 1.07692308 
    PR(B) = 10/13 = 0.76923077 
    PR(C) = 15/13 = 1.15384615
</pre>

My question is how Result B is derived from Equation A?

I try e.g. replacing PR(C) in equation PR(A)
<pre>
    PR(A) = 0.5 + 0.5 (0.5 + 0.5 (PR(A) / 2 + PR(B)))
</pre>

this seems to end up with an infinite loop. So I am confused how it can derive the result e.g. PR(A) value is 1.07692308?

Appologize for such stupid question. 

I appreciate any advice.

Let's allow that there is a matrix of approachibilities of the N*M size (N, M&gt; = 500), a matrix of costs of N*M and K of points with coordinates (x1, y1), (x2, y2)..., (xk, yk)

In a matrix of costs movement cost from a point of I (by xi, yi) in J point (xj, yj) is described. Thus cost is a tupple of two elements: tij - time for moving from i point to j and dij - distance between i and j points. If time is has more priority, it is necessary to take a point to which the distance is the smallest.

There are K of points (P1, P2, P3, P4). It is necessary to find such a point X which cost would be minimum.

The K is much smaller than N, M

I am doing some initial research on a system that will measure the uniformity of electricity across a conductor.  Basically we need to measure how evenly a signal is spread out on a surface.

I was doing research on how to determine uniformity of a data set and came across [this question][1] which is promising.  However I realized that I don't know what unit to use to express uniformity.  For example, if I take 100 equally spaced measurements in a grid pattern on the surface of an object and want to describe how uniform the values are, how would you say it?

 - ""98% uniform?"" - what does that mean? 98% of what?
 - ""The signal is very evenly dispersed"" - OK, great... but there must be a more specific or scientific way to communicate that... how ""evenly""?  What is a numeric representation of that statement?

Statistics and math are not my thing so if this seems like a dumb question, be gentle...

I've had a couple of ideas, one being pure brute-force involving performing a 3-dimensional loop ranging from 0..359 (either in steps of 1 or more, depending on results/speed requirements) on the set of vertices, measuring the difference between the min/max on both X/Y axis, storing the highest results/rotation pairs and using the most effective pair.

The second idea would be to determine the two points with the greatest distance between them in Euclidean distance, calculate the angle required to rotate the 'path' between these two points to lay along the X axis (again, we're ignoring the Z axis, so the depth within the result would not matter) and then repeating several times. The problem I can see with this is first by repeating it we may be overriding our previous rotation with a new rotation, and that the original/subsequent rotation may not neccesarily result in the greatest 2D area used. The second issue being if we use a single iteration, then the same problem occurs - the two points furthest apart may not have other poitns aligned along the same 'path', and as such we will probably not get an optimal rotation for a 2D project.

Using the second idea, perhaps using the first say 3 iterations, storing the required rotation angle, and averaging across the 3 would return a more accurate result, as it is taking into account not just a single rotation but the top 3 'pairs'.

I am fond on maths and physics, and reading a good demonstration in any of those fields (or read beautiful code) provokes an almost mystical emotion in me. I almost read nothing but physics books. I really love the stuff. But in school, I spent most of my time sleeping (because I spent my nights coding or drawing), and also never picked scientific courses (I knew I would have it easy and get high grades in literary/philosophical stuff without opening a book).

Following [this article by steve yegge][1], I'm working to catch on by reading wikipedia articles and whatever I can find on the net.

I am mainly a web dev, so the lack of maths never really had an impact on my code. I get along just fine. However, lately I've been dealing with two new things: game dev, and building my own database system. In both of those fields, I am severely feeling my weaknesses. I am looking to learn maths in practical way. Ideally, a math book written specifically for coders, with pseudo-programming notation instead of mathematical notations (I would rather learn about the logic without the added burden of learning a new syntax).

my problem is i want to know at what angle(or using what vector) the turret should aim to hit the target if it continues with constant speed in the same direction.

any help?

thanks.

with regards max

> A swimming pool is circular with a 10-metre diameter. The depth is constant along east-west lines and increases linearly from 1meter at the south end to 2meters at the north end. - Find the volume of water in the pool.

I figured out that its about using double integrals on polar coordinates, however from there I kinda stalled, first of all; (1) if the pool is circular and has a 10-metre diameter, am I certain that the diameter is 10metres everywhere on the pool? - or just on a single spot? - That is could the pool be oval?
(2) How far goes a 'side' alike west, east, north and south, on such a circular pool? - if its circular when will I know when I'm in the east line, and what about the north-east?
(3) Would it seem likely that I'm going to describe the pool as a polar function first, before even considering the use of Integrals?

> A swimming pool is circular with a 10-metre diameter. The depth is constant along east-west lines and increases linearly from 1meter at the south end to 2meters at the north end. - Find the volume of water in the pool.

I figured out that its about using double integrals on polar coordinates, however from there I kinda stalled, first of all; (1) if the pool is circular and has a 10-metre diameter, am I certain that the diameter is 10metres everywhere on the pool? - or just on a single spot? - That is could the pool be oval?
(2) How far goes a 'side' alike west, east, north and south, on such a circular pool? - if its circular when will I know when I'm in the east line, and what about the north-east?
(3) Would it seem likely that I'm going to describe the pool as a polar function first, before even considering the use of Integrals?

I know this might not be the correct fora, for math questions, however stackoverflow has always seemed like a nice helpfull community :)

My problem is I need calculate a formula for working out the taxable component when the tax rate is a variable.

I want a function into which I can plug in the total price and the tax rate, and get back the taxable component of the total price.

So,

If combined momentum before and after the collision is the same, and momentum is velocity times mass, then for 2 objects (A,B), it will be:

(m0 x v0) + (m1 x v1) = (m0 x v0Final) + (m1 x v1Final)

The final velocities for A,B are v0Final and v1Final.
The way to solve an equation that has 2 unknowns is to find another equation with the same 2 unknowns.

So we are using kinetic energy equation, KE = 0.5 x m x v^2

If kinetic energy before and after a collision is the same it will be:

KE0 + KE1 = KE0Final + KE1Final

Recently, I've been looking to find the interpolating cubic spline of some data that I have. I think I have a pretty good understanding of how it works: take x,y data, plug into a tridiagonal matrix, solve for the 2nd derivative of y(i), and calculate coefficients from the 2nd derivative.

However, I ran across an article in Game Programming Gems 5 which uses a cubic *Hermite* spline with *C2* continuity. This article uses a tridiagonal matrix to solve the linear equations, but it's actually solving for the 1st derivative instead of the second. After some more investigation, I noticed that Scilab also uses a Hermite spline with C2 continuity. Their splin() function returns the slopes of the input data.

Is there any advantage to using a C2 Hermite spline over a plain old cubic spline when it comes to interpolating data? If both have C2 continuity, I don't quite understand why you would use one over the other.

1. There is lack of application of mathematics in current software industry.

 e.g.: When a mechanical engineer designs an electricity pole , he computes the stress on the foundation by using stress analysis techniques(read mathematical equations) to determine exactly what kind and what grade of steel should be used, but when a software developer deploys a web server application he just guesses on the estimated load on his server and leaves the rest on luck and god, there is nothing that he can use to simulate mathematically to answer his problem (my observation).

2. Great softwares (wind tunnel simulators etc) and computing programs(like matlab etc) are there to simulate real world problems (because they have their mathematical equations) but we in software industry still are clueless about how much actual resources in terms of memory , computing resources, clock speed , RAM etc would be needed when our server side application would actually be deployed. we just keep on guessing about the solution and solve such problem's by more or less 'hit and trial' (my observation).

3. Programming is done on API's, whether in c, C#, java etc. We are never able to exactly check the complexity of our code and hence efficiency because somewhere we are using an abstraction written by someone else whose source code we either don't have or we didn't have the time to check it.

 e.g. If I write a simple client server app in C# or java, I am never able to calculate beforehand how much the efficiency and complexity of this code is going to be or what would be the minimum this whole client server app will require (my observation).

4. Load balancing and scalability analysis are just too vague and are merely solved by adding more nodes if requests on the server are increasing (my observation). 

Please post answers to any of my above puzzling observations.

Provided wifi nodes are setup in known positions around a building, one could trilaterate the position of the person. Because the distance between the nodes is already known , things like a wifi signal passing through different objects can be compensated for. Every few seconds a test would run comparing what the signal strength should be from node to node. If the signal strength varies from what is expected then we can expect that the signal is passing through a different material. These tests would give a constant ""weight"" that would then be used in trilateralation.

I have also tried to find velocity sensors but with no such luck. Accelerometers work but what if the object you want to track is traveling at a constant speed? Wouldn't the accelerometers then read 0?

GPS does not provide anywhere near the accuracy I need.

This is all speculation and I don't know the math behind it as of yet. 

The eventual application of this is to build a system that tracks firefighters or other rescue workers within a building. The building's blueprints would be stored on a computer and their positions would be mapped on the wireframe layout of the building. Allowing others on the outside to find them in the event of becoming trapped.

Buildings aflame, funnily enough, provide very little light. In some situations you can not see your hand in front of your face. Because of this, sensors that rely on optics probably would not work that well.
