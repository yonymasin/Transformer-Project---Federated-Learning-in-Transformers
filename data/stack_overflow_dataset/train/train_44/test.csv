I appologize if this post is slightly off topic in this forum, but I figure that some of the knowledgable folks in computer graphics know the answers to my disperate questions.

Right now I am a graduate student originally from Eastern Europe studying
mathematics(differential geometry) at a well respected university from the Midwest. My
research has not much to do with computer science. 

Although I love
mathematics, I have come to understand that the academia is NOT what I
thought it would be and now I am looking for different career options
after graduation. Since I am a fourth year graduate student, changing
research topic at this point is out of the question unfortunately.

I have always liked computer science (I have a BS in Math and Computer
science from my home country), especially computer graphics. I am willing to
take up this past hobby of mine and will try forge it into a career in
computer programming. But I have a few questions in the back of my
mind ...

I will most probably graduate two years from now with  a Ph.D in Math
and I will look to take a lot of computer graphics classes to try to
increase my knowledge and credibility in the subject of computer
graphics. I have no doubt that I can master this area of study since
this is something that I actually like and I have prior undergrad
level experience with it. My GPA in case of both Undergrad(from
my home country) and Graduate(from US school) studies is 4.0 and it will probably
stay close to that.

My problem is that summer internships are out of the question in my
case, since my department(mathematics) will likely not approve
anything that has nothing to do with my thesis topic, and this would
be required to maintain my visa status.

So two years from now, if everything goes well, I will hold a Ph.D in
math(Differential geometry) and I would have taken a lot of graduate
level computer graphics programming courses, without any internships
or other work related experience to my name.

Given this situation, do you think that after graduation computer
science companies will give me a chance to work for them?

Do you think employers will consider me overqualified with my Ph.D for
entry level programming jobs?

As strange as it sounds, do you think employers will consider me
under-qualified given that I will have no prior CS work experience and
a BS in computer science from a foreign country?

What advice can you give me to increase my credibility/knowledge in the field?

I don't have anyone around me that made this kind of career switch. I would appreciate any kind of advice. Any chunk of information is highly appreciated ...

This assumes that the circles have fixed starting points, and fixed movement paths, and calculates the time of the collision.

Is it possible to do it the other way around:

Circle 1: Starting point X1,Y1 velocity VX1,VY1  (fixed starting point, fixed linear movement path), radius R1
Circle 2: Starting point X2,Y2 velocity scalar (1m/sec, etc) (fixed starting point, fixed speed, unknown direction), radius R2

Is it possible to determine the collision position of the two circles for a minimum travel time?

I.E.
Circle 1 starts at 0,0 and moves at speed 1,0  (1 unit to the right per time)
Circle 2 starts at 5,5 and can move 1 unit per time
What would the collision position be (or the VX2,VY2 circle 2 would need to move in) in order for the 2 circles to collide at the lowest time T.
Radius of both circles is 1

In this example, a solution would be somewhere around Circle 1 being at point 3,0 at time 3. The question feels fairly complex as you have unknown variables: collision point, collision time, VX2, VY2. Although VX2 and VY2 would be constrained by |VX1|+|VX2| = 1.


The reason for the question is to tell circle 2 where it should move to in order to 'catch' circle 1. 

The brute force solution would be to check the position of circle 1 at every time interval, and calculate if circle 2 would collide with circle 1 if told to move to that point - but you could miss collision points of the circles were moving fast, or get a sub-optimal point, etc.

I've read the wikipedia articles and I'm confused about the start rank for players who enter the system at a later point. The common solution is to use a provisional ranking system but I'm curious if anyone can point me to specific numeric details:

- what K value do new players get?
- how long does a player stay in provisional mode?
- how does K value change as rank changes?

I'm sure there are many variations, I'd just like to know actual numbers for a system that someone has implemented successfully.

Thanks for your time.",math,statistics,,,,01/30/2012 00:05:19,off topic,1,99,8,"ELO ranking system: what's a good start rank? I'm looking to implement an ELO ranking system.

Now I need to know what the angle is of the projection (the view I'm looking at) and the rotation matrix's angle then I need to assign a vallue (between 0 and 8) based on that result.

or any other way I can add two rotations together and get a value between 0 and 8.

So basically if you're looking 90d and the enemy is walking 180d you'll see the sprite of the enemy drawn going right.

I've been trying this various ways for about 3 days now. If anyone has any ideas I'd love to h ear them.",math,opengl,matrix,trigonometry,quaternion,,open,0,121,2,"matrix/quaternion woes So I got two matrices, the modelview matrix (should only rotates on the Y axis) and a rotation matrix (only rotates on the Y axis).
