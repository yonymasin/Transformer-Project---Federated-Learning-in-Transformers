**The Situation**  
Within an existing Perl script I've got a reasonable long string `$str` containing an unknown number of line breaks (`\n`). There is now line break at the end of the string.

    $str = ""Hello\nWorld.\nHow is it going?""

**The Problem**  
I would like to add a certain (constant) number of white spaces at the beginning of each line within the string: (in this case 3)

    $str = ""   Hello\n   World.\n   How is it going?""

**First approach**
My first approach was the following RegEx

    $str =~ s/(.*?\n)/   \1/g;

And to cache the last line, which is not terminated by a new line

    $str =~ s/(.*)\n(.*)?$/\1\n   \2/g;

**The Wish**  
First. The above lines work perfectly and do exactly what I intended. But. I know, RegEx are powerful and thus I'm pretty sure, one can do the same thing in just one short RegEx. Unfortunately, I was yet not able to achieve this. (It's very likely, that I'm thinking way too complex.)

Note, the reason for the q{ } is because I eliminate the space when I do the regexp matching. This is so that in the case where the contents of [ ] are ignored, I don't get two spaces.

Also, I would like this to be scalable. What I mean by that is that eventually I will want to integrate `( )` to indicate grouping, and `|` to indicate the `or` operator in the sentences.

The end goal would look like:

`Input: ""(His|Her) dog was [very|extremely] confused.""`

However, I would be happy just to understand why my current subproblem is not working as expected. However I include the bigger picture in case there is a better tool than regular expressions.

However, I would be happy just to understand why my current subproblem is not working as expected. However I include the bigger picture in case there is a better tool than regular expressions.

I have searched both CPAN and SO under the phrases:

Expanding text<br>
expanding sentences<br>
expanding conditionals<br>
expanding optionals<br>
expanding groupings<br>

with no luck.

From this

to this:

This was the regex that I used to replace those lines as shown above.

> **Search: (.*)\scity\s(.*)**

> **Replace: |[[\1 (Misuri)|\1]] || ciudad**

Now, I tried to modified the regex for the replacing for another list of places in Vermont (and other states), but i couldn't create the Regex, 

The list goes like this: But this time i want to translate the county into Spanish and I want to eliminate 'town' just the one that are in lower cases and County in order to translate it to Spanish. 

> Andover town, Tolland County 3,303 

> Ansonia town, New Haven County	19,249

> Ashford town, Windham County	4,317

> Avon town, Hartford County	18,098
> etc..

At the end each line should look like this, can anyone help me? :

**|[[Andover (Vermont)|Andover]] || [[condado de Tolland (Vermont)|Tolland]] || 3,303**

Another question, there is another list that i want to replace this time they are townships in Arkansas, and im not sure if the same regex for the towns will work for them, so im just gonna ask for the regex now just in case, eliminating the word township and County where Municipio is township in Spanish.

    myquery site:edu.au site:edu.pl site:edu

domains with one google query
Have tried some regular expressions and wildcard characters but without spectacular success.
Anybody came across the same problem?

 I have this regex in javascript:

Basically, this regex should replace :) with an image of a smiley, however it is placing an image of a smiley face on either `:` or `)` not when both are next to each other.

How must I adapt this regex: `/["":)""]/g` to only replace if there is an exact match for `:)` not just one on it's own?

Thanks

I'm not a pro with regexp and especially in this specific context. Any idea how to use a function to do a RegExp Replace and then calling it from the query in Microsoft Access? 

By the way, this query oddly enough doesn't work fully and maybe it's why this could use regexp.

The idea is to match the three fields in the temp_table query:

    last_name || first_name || middle_initial
    Blair || Sheron || S
     Brown || Wanda || R
    Rodriguez || Lillian || M
    Glaubman || Alan ||

    BLAIR,SHERON S
    BROWN,BRENON I H/E BROWN,WANDA R 
    RODRIGUEZ,LILLIAN M
    GLAUBMAN,ALAN & SHORSTEIN,LILLIAN 

For some strange reason, my query fails to return the four names above, even though they are obviously in the temp_table, as shown above. The trick though is that names_1 and names_2 will have more names than what I need (as shown in the second item in the list above) so I must use Like. And if there's a value in middle_initial column, then I need to check print_ready for that middle initial as well, otherwise I don't check for middle_initial. This ensures if there's a middle initial, it doesnt't return records with first and last name similarities, but only returns the record with the initial as well.

Here's the query:

    SELECT print_ready.id, print_ready.names_1, print_ready.names_2, print_ready.addresses, print_ready.cities, print_ready.us_states_and_canada, print_ready.zip_codes

For some strange reason, my query fails to return the four names above, even though they are obviously in the temp_table, as shown above. The trick though is that names_1 and names_2 will have more names than what I need (as shown in the second item in the list above) so I must use Like. And if there's a value in middle_initial column, then I need to check print_ready for that middle initial as well, otherwise I don't check for middle_initial. This ensures if there's a middle initial, it doesnt't return records with first and last name similarities, but only returns the record with the initial as well.

Here's the query:

    SELECT print_ready.id, print_ready.names_1, print_ready.names_2, print_ready.addresses, print_ready.cities, print_ready.us_states_and_canada, print_ready.zip_codes

I can't seem to match a single character in a grammar, all my rules only work if they match the entire line.  I know this has to be possible because other grammars in YI obviously do this but doing the same thing doesn't seem to work.

I want to have a commit mode that eventually looks very similar to the one in vim.  One of the things that's useful in vim's mode is the keyword highlighting inside comments.  Git puts a bunch of information inside comments in most everything it does (commit, rebase, etc.) so this is useful.  My thinking was match the starting '#' character in git comments and switch to a different context that will match keywords.  However I can't seem to make a rule that matches _just_ the '#', the rule switches to comment style on lines that _only_ contain a '#' but on lines that contain anything after the '#' it does not switch styles.

What I have right now is:


    <0> {
    \#                             { m (const $ LineComment) Style.commentStyle }
    }

    }      
</code>

Details omitted obviously.  The idea is to switch to 'lineComment' mode when we see a '#' and style things differently until we see the end of the line. According to the documentation and examples there should be a way to do what I want.

For instance:

- *I want to match a number between 1 and 31, how do I do that ?*

The usual answer is don't use regex for this, use normal conditional comparisons. That's fine if you've got just the number by itself, but not so great when you want to match the number as part of a longer string. Why can't we write something like `\d{1~31}`, and either modify the regex to do some form of counting or have the regex engine internally translate it into `[1-9]|[12]\d|3[01]` ?

- *How do I match an even/odd number of occurrences of a specific string ?*

This results in a very messy regex, it would be great to be able to just do `(mytext){Odd}`.

- *How do I parse XML with regex ?*

[We all know][1] that's a bad idea, but this and similar tasks would be easier if the `[^ ]` operator wasn't limited to just a single character. It'd be nice to be able to do `<name>(.*)[^(</name>)]`

- *How do I validate an email with regex ?*

Very commonly done and yet very complex to do correctly with regex. It'd save everyone having to re-invent the wheel if a syntax like `{IsEmail}` could be used instead.

--------------
I'm sure there are others that would be useful too. I don't know too much about regex internals to know how easy these would be too implement, or if it would even be possible. Implementing some form of counting (to solve the first two problems) may mean it's not technically a 'regular expression' anymore, but it sure would be useful.

I've read through countless tutorials, guides and even tested my regex's in online regexp testers (where they seem to work), but I still can't get it to work in my code. I can, however, get it working in PHP for example.

I'm using PrimalScript to try to see what goes wrong, more on that later. Here's my current code which I'm using:

    Dim WSHShell, strString, nrMatches, myMatches
    
    Set WSHShell = CreateObject(""WScript.Shell"")
    Set myRegExp = New RegExp
    myRegExp.IgnoreCase = True

    ' myRegExp.Pattern = ""^\\\\(\w?)+\\(\w)*\s...\\(\w)*$""  <-- Returns 0 matches
    ' myRegExp.Pattern = ""^\\\\(.*?)+\\\(.*)*\s...\\\(.*)*$""  <-- Gives Syntax Error
    ' myRegExp.Pattern = ""^\\\\\\\\(.*?)+\\\(.*)*\s...\\\(.*)*$"" <-- Gives Syntax Error
    ' myRegExp.Pattern = ""^\\\\(.*)\\(.*)\s\.\.\.\\(.*)?$""  <-- Returns 1 match, the whole String

    strString = ""\\domain.subnet.net\share1 ...\share2""
    
    Set myMatches = myRegExp.Execute(strString)
    nrMatches = myMatches.Count
    MsgBox ""Found "" & nrMatches & "" Matches!"", vbOKOnly, ""Number of Matches""
    For Each myMatch In myMatches
    	MsgBox ""Value: "" & myMatch.Value, vbOKOnly, ""Found Match""
    Next
    WScript.Quit

The commented regex's are just a small portion of what I've tried, these are the ones I've had ""most"" sucess with. 

One thing that caught my eye was that, while debugging in PrimalScript, it basically told me that the myMatches.Item = Invalid number of parameters

I've read through countless tutorials, guides and even tested my regex's in online regexp testers (where they seem to work), but I still can't get it to work in my code. I can, however, get it working in PHP for example.

I'm using PrimalScript to try to see what goes wrong, more on that later. Here's my current code which I'm using:

    Dim WSHShell, strString, nrMatches, myMatches
    
    Set WSHShell = CreateObject(""WScript.Shell"")
    Set myRegExp = New RegExp
    myRegExp.IgnoreCase = True
    myRegExp.Global = True
    ' myRegExp.Pattern = ""^\\\\(.*?)+\\(.*)*\s...\\(.*)*$""  <-- Returns 1 match, the whole String
    ' myRegExp.Pattern = ""^\\\\(\w?)+\\(\w)*\s...\\(\w)*$""  <-- Returns 0 matches
    ' myRegExp.Pattern = ""^\\\\(.*?)+\\\(.*)*\s...\\\(.*)*$""  <-- Gives Syntax Error
    ' myRegExp.Pattern = ""^\\\\\\\\(.*?)+\\\(.*)*\s...\\\(.*)*$"" <-- Gives Syntax Error
    ' myRegExp.Pattern = ""^\\\\(.*)\\(.*)\s\.\.\.\\(.*)?$""  <-- Returns 1 match, the whole String
    myRegExp.Pattern = ""^(.*)+\\(.*)+(\s\.\.\.\\(.*))?$"" ' <-- Returns 1 match, the whole String
    
    strString = ""\\domain.subnet.net\share1 ...\share2""
    
    Set myMatches = myRegExp.Execute(strString)
    nrMatches = myMatches.Count
    MsgBox ""Found "" & nrMatches & "" Matches!"", vbOKOnly, ""Number of Matches""
    For Each myMatch In myMatches
    	MsgBox ""Value: "" & myMatch.Value, vbOKOnly, ""Found Match""
    Next
    WScript.Quit

The commented regex's are just a small portion of what I've tried, these are the ones I've had ""most"" sucess with. 

One thing that caught my eye was that, while debugging in PrimalScript, it basically told me that the myMatches.Item = Invalid number of parameters

    P1212 - F - we got this covered in the message on link above (no same ""sets"")
    P1221 - F - now new restriction - not even the reversed digits 12 - 21  
  
But, the problem now is that the P string can be very long! - like this:  
  
    P121315162324  
  
please notice this is ok since the ""sets"" are:  
  
    12 13 14 15 16 23 24  
  
Now, I could make this in the code (PHP) by checking if there are repetitions, but I was wondering if this can be done with single regex command?
