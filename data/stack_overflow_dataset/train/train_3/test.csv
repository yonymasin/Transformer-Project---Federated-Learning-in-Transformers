""Communication and Leadership"", ""1.Self-Knowledge"", ""2. Humility"" and ""(3) Clear Thinking"".  Many thanks.

   Communication and Leadership
   True leaders understand that, rather than forcing their followers into a preconceived mold, their job is to motivate and organize 

followers to collectively accomplish goals that are in everyone's interests. The ability to communicate this to co-workers and followers is 

critical to the effectiveness of leadership. 

      1.Self-Knowledge
Superior leaders are able to devote their skills and energies to leadership of a group because they have worked through personal issues to 

the point where they know themselves thoroughly. A high level of self-knowledge is a prerequisite to effective communication skills, because 

the things that you communicate as a leader are coming from within.

      2. Humility
   This subversion of personal preference requires a certain level of humility. Although popular definitions of leaders do not always see 

them as humble, the most effective leaders actually are. This humility may not be expressed in self-effacement, but in a total commitment to 

the goals of the organization. Humility requires an understanding of one's own relative unimportance in comparison to larger systems. 

    (3) Clear Thinking
   Clarity of thinking translates into clarity of communication. A leader whose goals or personal analysis is muddled will tend to deliver 

unclear or ambiguous directions to followers, leading to confusion and dissatisfaction. A leader with a clear mind who is not ambivalent 

about her purposes will communicate what needs to be done in a straightforward and unmistakable manner.",regex,,,,,01/16/2011 15:22:03,not a real question,1,289,4,"complex regular expression task What regular expressions do I need to extract section title(s) in a text file?

So for example, given a `(f|a)oo.*[ ]baz`, how many steps might the engine possibly go though through to match 100 characters?

I would also be interested if there is a tool that can take a bunch of text samples and show the average operations for each run.

I realize this will depend a lot on the engine used and the implementation -- but I am ignorant as to how common this is.

product page -> first page order form -> second page order form -> thank you page

I have checked the regex for all of the above by searching the filters in Top Content and have checked over all of them a few times.

On the funnel visualization page, every number listed is zero. On the goal detail page however, the data is as follows (for the two days the goal has been active):

8 total conversions
0.39% conversion rate
0.00% abandonment rate

This makes me think that in the funnels I should see 20 users start from the product page and get funneled down until only 8 actually get through to the thank you page. Is there something I'm missing? Why is the funnel visualization completely empty?
