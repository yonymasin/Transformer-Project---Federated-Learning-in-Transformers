----------

I have a Web Setup project in Visual Studio 2010.

In the `User Interface` section, I have a custom `Textboxes` dialog. These text fields have property names like EDITA1, EDITA2.

I have a `Custom Action` which makes use of these properties:

    CustomActionData = /foo=""[EDITA1]"" /bar=""[EDITA2]"" /zip=""[BLARB]""

In the code for handling this custom action, these parameters are available in the `Context.Parameters` dictionary

    public override void Install(System.Collections.IDictionary stateSaver) {
        string foo = Context.Parameters[""foo""]; // originates in edit box EDITA1
        string bar = Context.Parameters[""bar""]; // originates in edit box EDITA2
        string zip = Context.Parameters[""zip""];

Problem
----------

I want to be able to run the installer from a script, without a UI, so I need to pass in values for `foo` and `bar` via the command line. The way you're supposed to do this is by appending `PROPERTY=VALUE` to your MSI command line, like this:

    msiexec /qn /i MyInstaller.msi EDITA1=John EDITA2=Smith BLARB=Donut

But this doesn't work. Custom parameters which *aren't* associated with custom text fields *do* show up. For instance, `BLARB` gets passed through just fine (Parameters[""zip""]==""Donut""). But properties which are associated with the text fields do not show up, as if they are being nuked by the empty (but hidden) dialog box before my custom install function is called.

says that I should modify the registry at
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\VisualStudio\9.0\DataProviders

But I don't even have a folder namned DataProviders in the 9.0 (or 10.0) folder. So maybe that's a problem.

Thanx for any help!

I want to do static code analysis as part of solution compilation.

The possible ways I have identified with the help of SO and Google are:

- Edit every `.csproj` in the solution to include an invocation of the stand-alone FxCop 10 as a Post-build event. Pros: happens on every compile for every project that is rebuilt. Cons: Have to take additional measures to ensure new projects have this specified

- Create a new project, or identify an existing project, that is always built last, on account of its project dependencies. Give (just) that project a Post-build event that runs FxCop on all the assemblies in the (common) output folder. Pros: only one file to update, and less possibility of future projects going unanalysed. Cons: The vagaries of build dependencies might mean this doesn't actually work

- Update all developers' VS instances with an add-in or macro that runs FxCop after any build. Don't really like this idea at all.




Are there any other options, that are clearly better than any of the above? Are there any caveats or observations I need to be aware of to make one of the above work?

I also want FxCop to be run as part of a `MSBuild 4.0`-powered build on a build server. Which of the options will allow me to reuse code analysis rulesets between desktop compilation and bulid server compilation?

It's a great tool and does exactly what we need. However, integrating this into our build/deploy process is proving very difficult. 

Ideally, we want to run this tool **only** when we execute one of our TFS 2010 builds (i.e. **NOT** a local (Ctrl+Shift+B jobbie) build on a dev machine). Also, we want to replace our currently 'non-minified' files in this scenario with the minified ones (i.e. under the same file name) rather than having a load of additional files named '.min.js' etc.

After a lot of reading I think the key is for a custom build task within the workflow - but I've no idea on how to approach this - espeically as I'm looking to minify files that will have been pulled down directly from our release branch in TFS (i.e. not in someone's local workspace) as part of a TFS 2010 build.

I've always abided by it but have never really had a good reason to question it ... but VS has now presented one and I'm wondering if other people find themselves moving away from it for similar reasons.

When viewing .cs files, VS always puts 2 drop downs at the top of the page ... one for selecting related namespaces and one for all the methods within the current class.  It's the method dropdown that has me questioning the age-old standard.

Let's consider some class to manage some Employee data - You could easily end up with something like this:

    getEmployeeById
    getEmployeesByLastName
    getEmployeesByFirstName
    getEmployeesByManager
    getEmployees
    getEmployeesByDepartment
    getManagersForEmployee
    getManagersForDepartment
    getManagerById
    getManagers
    getDepartmentForEmployee
    getDepartmentById
    getDepartments

As you scan through this list, your eyes are forced to focus on the character 4 spaces in ... and that's assuming you know what verb the person used for a particular function.  If all you know is that you're looking for a method that should validate and check for an Employee then it gets hairier ... would it be ""validateAndCheckEmployee"" ... just ""validateEmployee"", ""checkEmployee"", ""existsEmployee"" ... ?

I think it's actually more helpful to start with the name of the primary object your method is dealing with:

    departmentGetForEmployee
    departmentGetById
    departmentGetAll
    employeeGetById
    employeeGetByLastName
    employeeGetByFirstName
    employeeGetByManager
    employeeGetAll
    employeeGetByDepartment
    managerGetForEmployee
    managerGetForDepartment

When you know you're looking for a method to create a new employee, it speeds up scanning (and prevents you from overlooking the right method because the author used ""addEmployee"" instead of ""createEmployee"" and you never scrolled up to see that method)

I know it's a small consideration ... but I've always been of the mindset that having a standard for the sake of having a standard has its uses but having a standard that also supplies some functionality or ease-of-use is even better.  And as someone in a group where we're currently working on defining coding standards, defining some standards that will be useful for years to come is a high priority for me right now.

Any examples of why people prefer this way or that way are welcomed and appreciated.",visual-studio-2010,coding-style,naming-conventions,,,03/08/2012 08:04:13,off topic,1,481,10,"Is the [verb][noun][details] naming standard for Methods outdated within VS? The longstanding standard for a method name is something like getEmployeeByName.

I've always abided by it but have never really had a good reason to question it ... but VS has now presented one and I'm wondering if other people find themselves moving away from it for similar reasons.

When viewing .cs files, VS always puts 2 drop downs at the top of the page ... one for selecting related namespaces and one for all the methods within the current class.  It's the method dropdown that has me questioning the age-old standard.

Let's consider some class to manage some Employee data - You could easily end up with something like this:

    getEmployeeById
    getEmployeesByLastName
    getEmployeesByFirstName
    getEmployeesByManager
    getEmployees
    getEmployeesByDepartment
    getManagersForEmployee
    getManagersForDepartment
    getManagerById
    getManagers
    getDepartmentForEmployee
    getDepartmentById
    getDepartments

As you scan through this list, your eyes are forced to focus on the character 4 spaces in ... and that's assuming you know what verb the person used for a particular function.  If all you know is that you're looking for a method that should validate and check for an Employee then it gets hairier ... would it be ""validateAndCheckEmployee"" ... just ""validateEmployee"", ""checkEmployee"", ""existsEmployee"" ... ?

I think it's actually more helpful to start with the name of the primary object your method is dealing with:

    departmentGetForEmployee
    departmentGetById
    departmentGetAll
    employeeGetById
    employeeGetByLastName
    employeeGetByFirstName
    employeeGetByManager
    employeeGetAll
    employeeGetByDepartment
    managerGetForEmployee
    managerGetForDepartment
    managerGetById
    managerGetAll

... which works well when other ""verb"" methods are introduced as the grouping becomes {Object}{Action}{Description} in the drop down list:

I want to fully understand how MSBuild multitargeting works.

I have read several articles from Microsoft and I think I understand the basic but I want to be sure I am not missing anything.

According to Microsoft:

> By using Visual Studio, you can compile an application to run on any one of several versions of the .NET Framework. For example, you can compile an application to run on the .NET Framework version 2.0, and compile the same application to run on the .NET Framework version 4. The ability to compile to more than one framework is named multitargeting.

> Visual Studio runs under the most current version of the .NET Framework that is installed on the development computer.

http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee395432.aspx

So do this mean that Visual Studio **always calls MSBuild from the latest framework installed**? assuming Visual Studio 2010 is installed, it will always call: `%WINDIR%\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\MsBuild.exe` when building **any project targettting any .Net Framework version** right???

If yes, then the ability to target old .Net Framewrok versions is based on the `ToolsVersion` and/or `TargetFrameworkVersion` properties right???

If yes again, it would mean that just installing the latest framework (and also the older frameworks but not installing visual studio) in my Continuous Integration box, I could point to build **always** any solution to: `%WINDIR%\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\MsBuild.exe` and just specify the `ToolsVersion` argument (if required, since each project can have its own target version specified in the `TargetFrameworkVersion` which it would cause to target an older .Net Framework version).

Following this I think my CI box would be building like Visual Studio does. Am I right? What am I missing? Is there a way to be completely sure?

I already tested, and _I think it works :p_ the projects are being built according to the .Net Framework specified but like I said I want to be sure I am not missing anything. According to the log file, the older versions of MSBuild are being executed.... 

Any thoughts?

BTW:

The simple reason to want to do that is because I have several custom MSBuild scripts that are reusable accross projects, but some of the functionality in these scripts require MSBuild 4.0 and also I have several MSBuild tasks built on top of the framework 4.0 so if I have for example a solution targetting the Framework 2.0 and I try to build it using: `%WINDIR%\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727\MsBuild.exe` I get MSBuild errors trying to load my custom targets

""A code block is a code path with a single entry point, a single exit point, and a set of instructions that are all run in sequence.

With this in mind, I still have no idea why, according to VS2010's code coverage analysis, this method has three blocks:


    public Type Foo()
    {
         return typeof(string);
    }


And this method has two blocks:


    public void FooTwo()

Code lines are more straightforward.  They're the number of lines of code including curly brackets.  But what are code blocks?

In my organisation, we separately develop multiple applications. In the end however, many of the applications (and their databases) are deployed to the same SQL instance, so they share the same master database.

We use Visual Studio 2010 database and server projects to source control said databases.

To try and standardise some things, I want to do the following:

1. Create a 'Core' Server database project which has all the server settings, core logins etc. Things like SET TRUSTWORTHY ON and server-level ANSI settings etc.
2. Have each Application's own Server.dbproj specify the logins and roles etc specific to that application.
3. Have each Application's own ApplicationDatabase.dbproj reference the ApplicationX.Server.dbproj

In theory, each Application in source control would only contain the items specific to it, rather than keeping server related settings or configuration synchronised across many projects.

### Problem ###
However, in practice I can get this far:

1. Done. Produces a .schema file which I reference in future steps
2. Done. Server.dbproj happily references Core.dbschema and 'extends' it with it's own logins and roles etc. Is happy to deploy this anywhere I point it.
3. Nadda. I add a reference from ApplicationDatabase.dbproj to Server.dbproj (assuming Server would pull in the items from Core) and it complains about any logins that are actually in Core. 

So I then added both Server and Core as references to ApplicationDatabase as it settled down. Compiles fine.

However, when you deploy, you get the same problem described here: http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/uk/vstsdb/thread/23cb9132-00d4-42ed-b34c-ab49027cddf7

    Only one element can be   contained in a model that can be deployed

The problem I think is that ApplicationDatabase essentially has two Server projects that it knows about, and therefore duplicate settings. 

Microsofts documentation makes no mention of using partial projects in Server projects, but neither is it listed as a limitation.

### So the question is... ###
Has anybody used partial projects successfully for Server projects, or is there a way you can see to achieve the same thing?

How can I get teambuild to load automatically the latest assemblies, without being forced to restart the controller?",3

I place database calls in a single source code module named ""dbcalls.pc"" - that gets passed to the precompiler which produces ""dbcalls.cpp"" which then gets passed on to the compiler and linker like all other .cpp files.

Under VC6 I do a compile on my custom build .pc file manually - ie; rt click the dbcalls.pc file and choose compile. Then due to a bug in the specific version of the Oracle precompiler I use I have to open the .cpp and insert #include ""stdafx.h"" at the top of the .cpp produced by by the precompiler - I have a macro that does this. Then I can perform a build on the entire project and the VC6 IDE will NOT attempt to re-run the custom build.

In VStudio 2010, I have replicated this with one important exception/problem - if I configure the dbcalls.pc file to be excluded from the build under properties (where it is specified as being of type custom build) then I am unable to rt click the file and choose compile.

If I set the property to be included in the build I can rt click and manually build the .pc into the .cpp but then after I alter the .cpp when I run a build for the project it reruns the custom build and removes my changes. I'm forced to go back and forth with the properties dialog and change the ""exclude from build"" setting. This is a royal PITA that does not happen in VC6.

Can anyone suggest workaround? Obviously if the precompiler did not have this bug then all would be good but moving to another version of the pc is not currently in the cards.

Is there any particular reason behind for doing this. I need to create view-presenter manually each time, i have got two add-ons for visual studio which helps with MVP

1.] Web Client Software Factory (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff699510.aspx)
2.] Nuget (http://nuget.codeplex.com/)

but they are not as powerful as inbuilt MVC 4.

So my basic question is why there in no MVP with visual studio. And I'm using right combinations of technologies.
