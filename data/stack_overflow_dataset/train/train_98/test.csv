Library2: needs include directory Y:\Lib2\Include and lib directory Y:\Lib2\Lib

Situation:
 Though I know VB, I never get a chance to create a DLL with the help of Visual Studio 2010 using VB

Steps tried:

 - Launch VS 2010 and created a Project by selecting ""VB Class library
   (.dll)""
 - Created a Class [say Maths.vb] with following code:


Namespace Maths
    Public Class Maths

        Public Const DLL_PROCESS_DETACH = 0
        Public Const DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH = 1

                    '                   DllMain = False
            End Select
        End Function

        Public Function AxIncrement(ByVal var As Integer) As Integer
            If Not IsNumeric(var) Then Err.Raise(5)

        End Function
    End Class
End Namespace



 - Do Right Click on Project and Create a Build >> This step will give
   you a dll created Maths.dll
 - Now Close the Project and create a New Project Say StandardEXE
 - Create a Form [say Form1.vb] with three buttons and put the following
   code by clicking View Code:

    Dim decr As Integer
    Dim sqr As Long

Situation:
 Though I know VB, I never get a chance to create a DLL with the help of Visual Studio 2010 using VB

Steps tried:

 - Launch VS 2010 and created a Project by selecting ""VB Class library
   (.dll)""
 - Created a Class [say Maths.vb] with following code:


Namespace Maths
    Public Class Maths

        Public Const DLL_PROCESS_DETACH = 0
        Public Const DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH = 1
        Public Const DLL_THREAD_ATTACH = 2

            If Not IsNumeric(var) Then Err.Raise(5)

 - Do Right Click on Project and Create a Build >> This step will give
   you a dll created Maths.dll
 - Now Close the Project and create a New Project Say StandardEXE
 - Create a Form [say Form1.vb] with three buttons and put the following
   code by clicking View Code:

I've enabled the message log, but it doesn't flinch when I try any key combo - it's doing absolutely nothing.

I've also tried repairing the installation but no joy... and have disabled all other VS extensions.

Am I missing something? Has anyone got this working with VS2010 (v10.0.040219.1 SP1Rel)?

I've also tried posting on the DX forums but they are out of action at the moment.
",visual-studio-2010,coderush-xpress,,,,,open,0,134,7,"Coderush xpress (11.2.11) not working in VS2010 I've just upgraded CodeRush Xpress from 10.1.4 to 11.2.11 (the latest version). 

Although the DexExpress menu has been restored, and I can still get to the options screen (CTRL + Shift + Alt + O), but none of the other shortcuts (e.g. CTRL + ') do anything. In the options screens, the the Refactor short is set and is enabled.

There also used to be a 'Refactor!' context menu that no longer appears.
