Now the connections works fine, the file upload works fine to. The problem is when the upload button is clicked and the btn_Upload_Click is executed (in the user control) the DataRow object is always null. It seems to me as if the webpart is loaded again but the provide is not called this time.

Now the connections works fine, the file upload works fine to. The problem is when the upload button is clicked and the btn_Upload_Click is executed (in the user control) the DataRow object is always null. It seems to me as if the webpart is loaded again but the provide is not called this time.

It is straight forward to deal with events which do not reoccur because I can compare [Start Date] to [Today]+30 with the modify this shared web part configuration, but for reocurring events it seems that [Start Date] and [End Date] describe the period over which the reocurring event is to occur, and I don't know what to do to determine the soonest upcoming reoccurance of an event. The cqwp only takes three filter items, so I can't deal with both recurring and single occurance items without overriding the query.

I think the field I need to use for reoccurrance is one of these:
msdn-microsoft-com/en-us/library/microsoft.sharepoint.spfieldrecurrence_members.aspx
but none of them seem appropriate.

How do you deal with the ""fourth day of the month"" reocurrance
msdn-microsoft-com/en-us/library/microsoft.sharepoint.weekofmonth.aspx

Basically, how do you override the query to filter reocurring and single occurance events to show only those which occur within a week?
