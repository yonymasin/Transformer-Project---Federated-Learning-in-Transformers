I am perfectly comfortable in the Webforms environment but I haven't touched MVC at all. My primary coding background is C++ but C# has really grown on me.

Now that I practically shared my life's story, would it be beneficial to try and learn Sharepoint full throttle? I want to make a lot of money and will be working in the DC Metro area.

As far as experience, I have built 3 ASP.Net Webforms applications from the ground up and learned C#, SQL, XHTML, XML, CSS, Photoshop/Expression Design and some jQuery along the way. I am perfectly comfortable in the Webforms environment but I haven't touched MVC at all. My primary coding background is C++ but C# has really grown on me.

Now that I practically shared my life's story, would it be beneficial to try and learn Sharepoint full throttle? I want to make a lot of money and will be working in the DC Metro area.

I just want to know if there is a future in Sharepoint development this late in the game. What are the chances that Microsoft abandons it and companies overhaul to something else instead of keeping Sharepoint in legacy mode?

I'm ready to start my career so any comments are appreciated. Thanks.",1

When a user needs to customize this documentation, they click a special link on SharePoint to generate a new document (DOCX) from the template they choose. This new document file always needs to be ""linked"" back to its template file on SharePoint. If the document loses that link, it won’t work correctly and is considered “broken”. 

When documents break, I need to re-establish the link back to the right template on SharePoint. It makes sense to do this programmatically so I can distribute the solution to my team.

I want to give each template file a unique Template ID (a three-digit number), stored in metadata or a custom file property. When new documents are generated from the templates, the Template ID automatically carries over into the document, so that’s set. Now I just need to use VBA to scan the template files in the SharePoint document library for the matching Template ID. When that’s found, I can re-establish the link and all is well.

",sharepoint,vba,metadata,,,,open,0,322,16,"Using VBA to read the metadata or file properties of files in a SharePoint doc library I have a few hundred Word templates (DOTX) on a SharePoint site. Many teams of users work with these templates.

When a user needs to customize this documentation, they click a special link on SharePoint to generate a new document (DOCX) from the template they choose. This new document file always needs to be ""linked"" back to its template file on SharePoint. If the document loses that link, it won’t work correctly and is considered “broken”. 

When documents break, I need to re-establish the link back to the right template on SharePoint. It makes sense to do this programmatically so I can distribute the solution to my team.

I want to give each template file a unique Template ID (a three-digit number), stored in metadata or a custom file property. When new documents are generated from the templates, the Template ID automatically carries over into the document, so that’s set. Now I just need to use VBA to scan the template files in the SharePoint document library for the matching Template ID. When that’s found, I can re-establish the link and all is well.

    Sub DocFixer()

We've recently upgraded (migration path) from TFS/Sharepoint to TFS2010/Sharepoint2010.

Most things went well, but there were a few issues that became immediately apparent.

1) TFS was noticeably slower (as pointed out by the entire dev team). Basically all ""get latest"", and query operations were more sluggish. Starting VS2010 SP1 is also really slow with loading all the projects (40+) on my machine. A refresh after that is not normally a problem. Even though other people may only have 3-4 projects open at the time, they too noticed the ""working..."" delay.

2) Sharepoint was definitely *much* slower. The ""Show Portal"" takes forever to load, and the basic editing is slower too.

3) Work items occasionally ""time out"" for no reason, and end up in a ""connection lost"" error. It's normally while creating a new work item, and a redo of the same command works fine. It happens even during bulk work item creation, but the timing is random.

The server runs on Windows 2008, 12 GB, and plenty of CPU power (QuadCore). The IIS connectionTimeout is set to 2 minutes (default), I've played with the MinBytesPerSecond which is set to 240 by default (I've set it to 42 as well, but no joy), and I understand that VS 2010 in general might be a bit slower than its 2008 counterpart, but even then. No processors are maxed out. There are lots of MSSQLSERVER info logs in the Event Viewer though (I just noticed this - not sure if this is a problem). I've also changed the defaultProxy setting in the devenv.exe file - no joy there either.

`<Contains><FieldRef  Name='ProjectProperty.Title' /><Value Type='Text'>Site_NAme</Value></Contains>`

but i get no results, when i use Title or FileRef or any other field filter is working fine, what should i use instead of ""ProjectProperty"" and ""ListProperty ""??

Most examples that I've found log into the Event Log or some other file, but I did not really find one yet for logging into the ULS.

Annoyingly, Microsoft.SharePoint.Diagnostics Classes are all marked Internal. I did find [one example][1] of how to use them anyway through reflection, but that looks really risky and unstable, because Microsoft may change that class with any hotfix they want.

The Sharepoint Documentation wasn't really helpful either - lots of Administrator info about what ULS is and how to configure it, but i have yet to find an example of supported code to actually log my own events.

I'm a programming consultant working on a WSS project site system for my client. We have a document library in which files are uploaded to go through a complex approval process. With multiple stages in this process, we have an extra field which dictates what the current status of the document is.

Now, my client has become enamored with the idea of PDF watermarking. He wants the document (which is already a PDF) to be affixed with a watermark corresponding to the current status, such that with each stage of the approval process the watermark will change.

One method, the traditional method for PDF watermarking, of accomplishing this is to have one ""clean"" copy of the document somewhere hidden on the site, and create a new PDF from it that has the watermark at each stage of the approval process. Since the filename will never change, this new PDF can be uploaded continually to a public library, always overwriting the old version and simulating a ""dynamically changing watermark"". However, in the various stages there will also be people uploading clean copies with corrections and suggestions, nevermind the complex nature of juggling around two libraries and the fact we double the number of files stored. My client and I agree that this is not a practical path to choose.

What we would like to do is be able to ""modify"" the watermark in a PDF, so that we only have to keep one copy of the file. Unfortunately, from what I've seen, in most cases when you make something like a watermark, which in its nature is supposed to be ""unmodifyable"", you won't be able to edit it later. So, is it possible to have a part of a PDF which cannot be changed by anyone who downloads the file, but can be changed as part of a workflow or other object model process?

",sharepoint,provisioning,,,,,open,0,476,5,"SharePoint file provisioning not working. I have created a feature in Visual Studio, using WSPBuilder to build the .wsp file, which contains some aspx files that need to be copied to the _layouts folder.

I have a library in which there are two content types: say ""documents"" and ""drawings.""
 
For the past year, there were only files with the type ""documents"" in the the library but recently I have wanted to add drawings to it.  When I uploaded a bunch of these drawings (~350 items) and set the default content type as ""drawings,"" some of the files of which previously had the type ""documents"" switched content types to the ""drawings.""
 
Just the type changed, the files are the same etc. 

When I added some more drawings, I noticed the same thing: mroe documents changed their content type.

I have a library in which there are two content types: say ""documents"" and ""drawings.""
 
For the past year, there were only files with the type ""documents"" in the the library but recently I have wanted to add drawings to it.  When I uploaded a bunch of these drawings (~350 items) and set the default content type as ""drawings,"" some of the files of which previously had the type ""documents"" switched content types to the ""drawings.""
 
Just the type changed, the files are the same etc. 

When I added some more drawings, I noticed the same thing: mroe documents changed their content type.
