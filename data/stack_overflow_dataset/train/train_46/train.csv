I am quite new to programming with JQuery and Ajax so not sure exactly what I am missing that would prevent the home button from working on the all-parking page. 

I have tried changing this line

    <li><a href=""#"" data-theme=""b"" id=""goHome"">Home</a></li>

to

    <li><a href=""#home"" data-theme=""b"">Home</a></li>

and not using the change page script but this didn't work. 

The home button works fine on any page that does not require the info from the XML.

Any help is appreciated. Thank you",3

  [1]: http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8161/7603141016_63bea45ed5_b.jpg 

My prob is I can't seem to display all with in the form including the template I made (no unless I click edit btn, that is the time the label/text field shows) but not on first load.

templates:
Email:

        <g:if test=""${!isEditEmail}"">
	        	  <td id=""email"">${profileInstance?.email}</td></g:if>
	        <g:else>
	        	<td><g:textField name=""emailTxt"" value=""${profileInstance?.email}"" />
	  </td></g:else>

Phone


        <g:if test=""${!isEditPhone}"">
	        	  <td id=""email"">${profileInstance?.phone}</td></g:if>
	        <g:else>
	        	<td><g:textField name=""emailTxt"" value=""${profileInstance?.phone}"" />
	        	</td></g:else>


Snippet code from My GSP called ""profile"" for Phone: 

 <tr>

        <th scope=""row""><label for=""profileEditPhone"">Phone:</label></th>

         <td id=""showPhoneText""></td>
			
        <td><g:actionSubmit id=""btnEditPhone""  action=""setPhoneTxtAreaVisible"" update=""showPhoneText"" value=""${message(code: 'default.button.edit.label', default: 'Edit')}"" /></td>

      </tr>

here is my code:

    def setPhoneTxtAreaVisible=
    	{
    		def employeeId= params.employeeId
    		
    		MySession session = MySession.getMySession(request, params.employeeId)
    		isEditPhone=true
    		profileInstance = session.profileInstance
    	
    		render(template:""/layouts/phoneProfile"", model:[profileInstance:session.profileInstance, isEditPhone:true])
    		
    
    	}

this is working great but the output is the  `<td id=""showPhoneText""></td>` has no value or display in the GSP (profile) unless I click the button ""btnEditPhone"". 

So I changed my code to:

    def profile=
    	{
    		def employeeId= params.employeeId
    		

		MySession session = MySession.getMySession(request, employeeId)
		
		//findAllByCmCaseIdCmCase
		def employee = Employee.get(employeeId as Long)
		def empUser = EmployeeUser.findByEmployeeIdEmployee(employee)
		profileInstance = new Profile();
		profileInstance.id=employeeId as Long
		profileInstance.userName  = empUser.useridUsers.username
		profileInstance.password = empUser.useridUsers.passwordText
		profileInstance.email = employee.emplEmailAddr
		profileInstance.employeeName = employee.formatFirstLastName()
		profileInstance.phone = employee.formattedEmplWorkTelNbr()
		session.profileInstance = profileInstance
		
		if(profileInstance)
		{
			
			render(template:""/layouts/phoneProfile"", model:[profileInstance:session.profileInstance, isEditPhone:false])
		}
			
		return [profileInstance: profileInstance, mySession: session, isEditEmail:false]
	}

-not working great, only renders the phone template. 

So I changed my html code to this instead of using update

    <tr>
     		<th scope=""row""><label for=""profileEditPhone"">Phone:</label></th>
               <td ><g:render template=""/layouts/phoneProfile"" /></td>
       		
            <td> <g:submitToRemote action=""setPhoneTxtAreaVisible"" value=""${message(code: 'default.button.edit.label', default: 'Edit')}""  /></td>
            <td>&nbsp;</td>
    
          </tr>
-not working as I want..

I would like to make good use of Ajax, but I don’t fully understand how should I cope when JS is off.  

So let’s say JS is on, user submits the form, clicks submit button and thru ajax, data is submitted to register.php (register.php is specified in forms action attribute).  register.php returns data and jQuery displays appropriate message. All without reloading the page.  

 Now, if JS is disabled, submitting form to register.php won’t do much good.  

The way I understand it, solution would be to create one php script for JS enabled, other for JS disabled. So by default form would have action attribute with `nonjs_register.php`, and if JS would be enabled, it would force the form to be submitted to `js_register.php` rather than default `nonjs_register.php`. 
I can imagine that would be quite tedious to create two scripts pages for each user interaction with the application but that’s the only way I can think of at the moment.  

I hope all that makes sense but please let me know if my explanation is not quite clear. 
Now if anyone could explain to me what is the common practice to deal with that kind of problem that would be great.

The main coder on this (no longer with the company) did a few non-standard things in the implementation that I'm wondering about:

1)  Instead of a [ValidateAntiForgeryToken] attribute decorating each controller method, he put an explicit declaration of the attribute in a base controller class that all our controllers descend from.  I'm wondering if that might have something to do with how the tokens get generated.

2)  We have the tokens in our AJAX calls which in many cases return entire HTML pages (mostly popups).  This results in two or more <form> tags an a page, each with their own verification tokens - which are different from each other as well as from the cookie value that's used to verify.  We have included code in our jQuery AJAX calls to include the value of the VerificationToken (see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1346070/asp-net-mvc-antiforgerytoken-over-ajax).   The fact that the pages work most of the time is telling me that the proper hidden token is getting posted to be authorized, but I'd like to know what is going wrong when it doesn't.

I'm trying to put a try-catch block in the verification method that would at least give us the cookie value and the token to see if they both exist.  Can anyone think of other values that would be useful in the debugging process?  Are there time limits on the tokens - we have had some errors when just sitting on a page for a certain amount of time.

    @Ajax.ActionLink(""show cart"", ""Show"", ""Cart"", new AjaxOptions() { OnSuccess = ""handleSuccess"", HttpMethod = ""Get"", OnFailure = ""handleFailure"" })

Generate HTML:

    <a data-ajax=""true"" data-ajax-failure=""handleFailure"" data-ajax-method=""Get"" data-ajax-success=""handleSuccess"" href=""/Cart/Show"">show cart</a>

As said, this works just fine:

    @using (Ajax.BeginForm(
            ""Show"",
            new { controller = ""Cart"" },
            new AjaxOptions
            {
                OnSuccess = ""handleSuccess"",
                OnFailure = ""handleFailure""
            }))
        {
            <input type=""submit"" class=""button"" />
        }

The action looks like this:

    [Authorize]		
    public ActionResult Show()
	{
		if (Request.IsAjaxRequest())
		{
			ViewBag.CartItems = ShoppingCart.GetCart(this)
				.Items;

			return Json(new AjaxResultViewModel()
			{
				Content = RenderPartialViewToString(),
				UpdateTargetSelector = ""#dialog"",
				InsertionMode = InsertionMode.InsertBefore
			}, JsonRequestBehavior.AllowGet);
		}

		ViewBag.Exception = new NotSupportedException();
		return View(""Error"");
	}

I've been searching for a while now and couldn't find the reason for this behavior, maybe someone could help me out?

Any examples out there?,"I have an idea to implement a deep zoom type interface hosted in a browser for sports training data (speed, distance, heart rate etc.) However, rather than images I actually want to zoom into a hierarchy of information. For example, the initial display would contain a grid of years - hover over 2008, for example, and spin the mouse wheel (or click) will zoom into that year but during the zoom I want 2008 to fade out and be replaced with a calendar of months. Again zoom into a month and the months are replaced with the months calendar, zoom into a day and you finally see a chart with the training data plotted on it. All the time only dates with actual data would be highlighted in some fashion.

My question is whether this would even be possible and whether anyone has seen examples of this already. I'm imagining that most of the time the next level of information could be cached in the browser (in fact, because this is calendar-based, I can calculate most of that and cache the dates to be highlighted.) I could also zoom into an empty chart whilst an Ajax thread is fetching the data to display.

I've never tried anything like this before and I'm especially interested in whether DHTML would be capable of this sort of zoom (I suspect not and I would have to resort to Silverlight) and whether the Ajax execution would be uninterrupted whilst the browser rendering thread is kept busy zooming.

I am working on a basic blog site. Users can create posts with a title, description, and declare whether others can see the post (public or private). From the index page, I want the user to be able to see a list of their posts, toggle public|private, and delete the post. Listing is easy (I'm rendering a partial based on the user's posts), and the AJAX delete link is working nicely:

    <%= link_to 'Delete Post', post, :confirm => 'Are you sure?', :method => :delete, :remote => true %>

Toggling public|private corresponds to an edit/update action, and I cannot figure out how to do that using a link or button--it seems I have to use a form. I've tried a lot of variations of the working delete button that look something like this (and none work):

    <%= link_to 'Make Public', { :controller => ""posts"", :action => ""update"", :id => post, :public => true, :post => post }, :method => :put, :remote => true %>

The only way that seems to work is with a form, but this requires that the user click the `Update Post` button:

    <%= form_for(post, :remote => true) do |f| %>
      <div class=""field"">
        <%= f.label :public %><br />
        <%= f.check_box :public %>
      </div>
      <div class=""actions"">
        <%= f.submit %>
      </div>
    <% end %>

So, in Rail3 what is the proper way to update a single attribute? (Is there more fitting verbiage?) Can it be done using a link or button? Do I have to use a form?

I use AJAX to load <div> on page dynamically, depending on dropdown selected option. Generated <div> contains some Labels for containing dropdowns and option text inside of dropdowns. Labels are constants encoded in UTF-8 and contain some western European accented characters, and option texts are loaded from database, contain accented characters too but are coded in ANSI. <meta> tags are set to utf-8 but it affects only first load of page, cos its all put together on page. After selecting other options, AJAX fills <div> with elements and it loads labels well but options text is messed up, so i guess AJAX doesnt load up encoding with text second and etc. times. Work-around was to change label text in constants and set 
<% Response.Charset = ""windows-1252"" %> on page that is beeing loaded first time.
Now, i want to find better way for this, prefferably in AJAX response to set it all to UTF-8 or windows-1225, or to set each element on page to have different coding with ajax.

I am not familiar with Ajax or Javascript so please bare with me.

The function should do the following:

 1. User clicks on Button
    
 2. Animated Gif Appears (Loading Bar)
    
 3. Button Update User's Status
    
 4. Animated Gif Disappears
    
 5. Facebook Canvas page is updated
  
[The code I currently have can be found at Pastebin][1].

I am having trouble thinking of Step 2 and 4.

I need to optimize Step 5.

To clarify what happens on Step 5. I have Box 1 which has my stats. And Box 2 which has my points. I click on Box 1. This should update Box 1 with 1 points, and update Box 2; minus a point. (Clicking on Box 1, concurrently update both boxes)

I have successfully done this, but it is quite slow. I was wondering if there are alternative way that may be faster than what I am currently doing.

Your advice is greatly appreciated.
