The first controller I want to be tested is my `UsersController`.

Here's the controller code:

    class UsersController < ApplicationController
      load_and_authorize_resource
      respond_to :html, :js
    
      def index
        @users = User.page(params[:page])
      end
    
      def show
        @user = User.find(params[:id])
      end
    
      def destroy
        User.find(params[:id]).destroy
        render :index
      end
    
      def turns_manager
        @user = User.find(params[:id]).manager!
        respond_with(@user, :layout => !request.xhr?)
      end
    
      def turns_moderator
        @user = User.find(params[:id]).moderator!

        respond_with(@user, :layout => !request.xhr?)
      end
    
    end


It's pretty basic but I have 3 actions that I make use of Ajax requests.

For now, I have the following tests:

    require 'spec_helper'

    describe UsersController do
    
      include Devise::TestHelpers
    
      it ""should get #index"" do
        get 'index'
        response.should be_success
      end
    
      context ""should get #show"" do
        before { @user =  FactoryGirl.create(:user) } 
    
        get 'show', :id => @user
        response.should be_success
      end
    
      it ""should DELETE #destroy"" do
        delete 'destroy'
        response.should be_success
      end
    
    end

Is this the correctt way of testing controllers?

I appreciate any help.

The first AJAX-heavy project I worked on ended up with 20-30 controller actions tied directly to specific UI-behaviors and my view code spread over controller actions, partials and rjs files .  

The one headache I've found from using pure JSON is that you have to 'render' HTML via JS, which in the case of AJAX that has to update DOM-heavy elements, can be a real pain.  I end up with long string building code like

    // ...ajax 
    success: function(records){
      $(records).each(function(record){
        var html = ('<div id=""blah"">' + record.attr +
          etc +
        ')
      })
    }

where etc is 10-15 lines of dynamically constructing HTML based on record data.  Is there a better practice for this approach?

(My motivation for finally reaching out is I am now tasked with updating HTML so complex it required two nested loops of Ruby code to render in the first place.  Duplicating that in Javascript seems insane.)

I'm just thinking out loud, but when the page first loads the `#{reg.fieldsRequired}` expression is false.  If I then change the SelectOneMenu to set this boolean value to true, then press the submit button, the disabled attribute doesn't seem to have been set.  I wondered if this is simply a ajax issue and that all of components simply needed to be re-renderd so I added the @form in my ajax call: `<a4j:ajax render=""@form"" listener=""#{reg.saveActionChanged}""/>` in hopes that would fix the problem, but no difference in the behavior.

However I don't have access tho the reverse router in the external js files, but would often like to leverage the indirection of the reverse router for requests in these files.

I am hoping some experienced individual will interject if this is for some reason dumb...",ajax,templates,playframework,global-variables,,,open,0,196,13,"creating a global urls object in javascript, for easy reverse routing in templates I am working on a web project that uses lots of ajax. I am using playframework, and in my html templates, I have access to the playframework reverse router, so I can get urls from the router and not have to worry about what happens if I later decide to change the url structure of the site. However I don't have access tho the reverse router in the external js files, but would often like to leverage the indirection of the reverse router for requests in these files.

I came up with a solution that doesn't force every external ajax function to accept a url parameter, and that was to create a global url object like this:

    var globalUrls = {
        confirmImageUpload : ""@routes.UploadController.confirmResourceUpload()"",
        anotherUrl : ""@routes.AnotherController.anotherControllerMethod()""
	}

I then use this object in the external js files to know where to send ajax requests.

- Then the message automatically updates itself with 'Processing 2/100, 3/100, etc' automatically.

Now, I want to re-render (only) the `valueContainer` of a **specific element** within this list **using AJAX** (say, the element with index 1). I have already tried all of these combinations without any luck:

 - I need to identify the component to

   path**, because the button that
   triggers the update is somewhere
   completely different in the component
   tree.
 - Re-rendering the entire page or
   form (using `@all`/`@form`) is
   useless to me, because that kind of
   puts into question why I am using JSF/AJAX
   at all...
 - I need to achieve the same thing with PrimeFaces `<p:dataGrid>` cells (i.e. update only a specific sub-component of a specific cell), but I assume that this reduces to the same problem.

I guess there must be an easy solution to this that I am currently overlooking?!
