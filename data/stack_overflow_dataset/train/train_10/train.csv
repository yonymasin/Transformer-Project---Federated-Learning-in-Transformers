9323978,02/17/2012 06:40:33,177920,09/23/2009 16:21:07,57,9,Why is SvnAnt still trying to connect to my old repository IP address?,"I know just enough about Ant and SvnAnt to be dangerous. I put together the build.xml and .properties files a while back, and now that I'm running into issues I'm out of my league I fear.

Simple scenario.  I have an SvnAnt task that would update code from a remote repository.  Worked great.  Recently the IP address of that repository changed, so I opened up my build.properties file and changed the IP address accordingly:

    svnant.project.url=http://my.new.ip.here/svn/project/trunk

Problem is, when I run ant and specify the update target *SvnAnt is still trying to hit the old IP*.  I went so far as to throw this in my build.xml file, under the corresponding task:

    <echo message=""${line.separator}Updating working copy from ${svnant.project.url}"" />

And sure enough, when I run the ant task I see the message:

    update:
     [echo]
     [echo] Updating working copy from http://my.new.ip.here/svn/project/trunk
    ...

But this task always errors out after a minute or so with this error:

    svn: PROPFIND request failed on '/svn/project/trunk'
    svn: PROPFIND of '/svn/project/trunk': could not connect to server (http://OLD.FREAKING.IP.HERE)

Note the **OLD.FREAKING.IP.HERE** part.

So my question is: why is Ant/SvnAnt still trying to connect to my old IP?

I've restarted Apache. Nothing of interest in /etc/hosts.

Thanks

The error i'm getting is:

and this is what /usr/local/test/ looks like:

I am using psycopg2 to connect to the database. But when I connect to remote host,
I got following error.

            TCP/IP connections on port 5432?

I also configure pg_hba.conf to allow database access from the client. But still I got the same error.

the ip of my hosts are:

    server ip = 10.224.77.209

Running the program with `ltrace` will show the call to `printf` since that is a standard library function (which is a dynamic library on my system) and `strace` will show all the system calls from the startup code, the system calls used to implement printf, and the shutdown code, but I want something that will show me that the function `triple` was called.  Assuming that the local functions have not been inlined by an optimizing compiler and that the binary has not been stripped (symbols removed), is there a tool that can do this?

http://www.usenetmessages.com/view.php?c=computer&g=1074&id=78029&p=0

The answer, the article says, is using the robust pthreads API. I've found the following article about this topic:

http://www.embedded-linux.co.uk/tutorial/mutex_mutandis

But, having implemented the following code, I'm having an unreliable behavior, that is, should I tell process 3, for instance, to segfault, the code works just fine. The other processes wake up, recognize that a process died while holding the mutex, and recover. However, should I tell process 0 to die, or should I remove the sleep call on line 63, the other processes do not wake up once the failling process kills itself. Am I doing something wrong?

My project have the following characteristics/requirements:

 - User files are stored in **dedicated servers**. Each file is stored in 2 separate machines, located in different data centers (150-200 miles away from each other)

 - I'm using Amazon RDS to host mysql database (*)

 - The mysql database is fairly compact (only hold IDs/files metadata)

 - Total data is around 50TB, although it does change and will definitely grow with time

 - Fairly easy to setup & maintain

 - Handle data storage so that I **only** have to care about removing/adding new servers if the need arise (ie. add new servers to the filesystem's server pool by editing a simple config, or something like that)

I've been using Ubuntu for some time now, and have become more reliant on Twitter to keep me notified about the changes in the world or the things which interest me. Because of this, I went searching for a good Twitter-client for Ubuntu. After some trials, I went with [Spaz][1]. But one thing I noticed by this AIR-app, were the place it left its shortcut. It created an own folder under Applications (Applications -> Spaz -> Spaz). Which in my eyes is totally wrong. The correct way should be more platform integrated (Applications -> Internet -> Spaz). And not break on other platforms like Mac OS and Windows.

So, to the issue. I have been searching high and low for a good solution to be able to control where the AIR-app installs the shortcut under Ubuntu. But have yet to find the solution.

Is there a way to control this? Be able to add a shortcut in the correct place.

I've searched for information about the `programMenuFolder` attribute, trying to find some info about it. But it seems rather simple and don't have many options.


Any feedback is given my biggest gratitude.

I'm new to git and while learning it I stumbled upon this.
How does `git branch branchName` and 'ls' work with each other.
For eg:
If I have a master and test branch and test branch has an extra testFile when compared to master branch.

I'm so confused that dose Bridge module conflicts with the driver module of my new NIC? Or..something else?

Who can help me,Thanks a lot!:)",linux,kernel,arm,driver,bridge,05/31/2012 03:17:56,off topic,1,860,10,"Anybody had a problem like this? It's making me crazy... I need to build a transparent bridge between two NICs in a development board(ARM9 with LINUX OS(2.6.32 kernel)):

Firstly,cause there is only one NIC on the board,so I transplanted a driver of USBtoRJ45(with NIC) to the board,and it works well.

Secondly,to build a bridge between two NICs,I built in the ""802.1d Ethernet Bridging"" module and rebuilt the kernel, and then the command ""brctl"" can work.

However,when i want to config the new NIC by ""ifconfig eth1 192.168.1.231..."" and Enter,all things crashed,Oops error jumped out:

This is rather a nusance as I am trying to run a benchmark of **Nginx w/ caching** vs **Varnish w/ caching on top of Nginx** to see if there is any performance benefit of one over the other.

As such I have straight Nginx w/ caching listening on port `8080` and varnish on port `80` which forwards any non-cached requests to Nginx on `localhost:8080`, so obviously what I want to do is run an `ab` benchmark on `http://www.mylesgray.com:8080/` and on `http://www.mylesgray.com/` to see the difference.

But I can't do this as if you run `curl -I http://www.mylesgray.com:8080` you will get this:

<pre><code># curl -I http://www.mylesgray.com:8080

So as you can see one is served by Varnish and the other by Nginx but I cannot find **anywhere** anything that does a 301 redirect, not in `nginx.conf` or in the `sites-enabled/default` file and I don't believe it is caused by Wordpress itself but an very much open to correction.

As such I have straight Nginx w/ caching listening on port `8080` and varnish on port `80` which forwards any non-cached requests to Nginx on `localhost:8080`, so obviously what I want to do is run an `ab` benchmark on `http://www.mylesgray.com:8080/` and on `http://www.mylesgray.com/` to see the difference.

But I can't do this as if you run `curl -I http://www.mylesgray.com:8080` you will get this:

<pre><code># curl -I http://www.mylesgray.com:8080

HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
Server: nginx/0.7.65
Date: Sun, 05 Feb 2012 12:07:34 GMT
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
Connection: keep-alive
X-Powered-By: PHP/5.3.2-1ubuntu4.7ppa5~lucid1
X-Pingback: http://www.mylesgray.com/xmlrpc.php
Location: http://www.mylesgray.com/</code></pre>

Then running `curl -I http://www.mylesgray.com` gives:

<pre><code># curl -I http://www.mylesgray.com

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/0.7.65
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
X-Powered-By: PHP/5.3.2-1ubuntu4.7ppa5~lucid1
X-Pingback: http://www.mylesgray.com/xmlrpc.php
Content-Length: 5132
Date: Sun, 05 Feb 2012 12:07:29 GMT
X-Varnish: 1419774133 1419774124
Age: 30
Via: 1.1 varnish
Connection: keep-alive
</code></pre>

So as you can see one is served by Varnish and the other by Nginx but I cannot find **anywhere** anything that does a 301 redirect, not in `nginx.conf` or in the `sites-enabled/default` file and I don't believe it is caused by Wordpress itself but an very much open to correction.

Please help, this is driving me nuts!

The modem is set up to send data via ethernet (eth0). However, if the ethernet connection is unavailable, it needs to switch to wireless (ppp0) as a backup. I tried SO_BINDTODEVICE but it did not work, I believe because of permission issues. What works, but is complicated and prone to errors, is to reconfigure the modem on the fly by disabling the eth0 port (with an AT command) which forces the socket connections to be made through the wireless port. Then, I periodically check if eth0 is back up by reconfiguring the modem, checking the connection and then reconfigure back to ppp0 if it is not. Its clumsy and the device's AT server is unreliable.

Is there a better way? 

One idea would be to have two urls on our remote server. One for ethernet socket and one for wireless. Thus, you could set up the routing tables accordingly. if the connection to the ethernet url is not successful, try the other url which will be routed to the ppp0 interface.

What works, but is complicated and prone to errors, is to reconfigure the modem on the fly by disabling the eth0 port (with an AT command) which forces the socket connections to be made through the wireless port. Then, I periodically check if eth0 is back up by reconfiguring the modem, checking the connection and then reconfigure back to ppp0 if it is not. Its clumsy and the device's AT server is unreliable.

Is there a better way? 

One idea would be to have two urls on our remote server. One for ethernet socket and one for wireless. Thus, you could set up the routing tables accordingly. if the connection to the ethernet url is not successful, try the other url which will be routed to the ppp0 interface. 

Good idea or not? Any other ideas?",2

Even the listening socket in port 26000 is created as you can see here:

    Active Internet connections (only servers)
    Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State       PID/Program name

The problem is that when I connect to a web interface in a browser: http://127.0.0.1:26000 nothing happens - it just loads it indefinitely.

But the Recv-Q in the netstat output clearly shows there are packets waiting to be read by the application, which never happens. 

Does anybody have any idea why or how to debug it?",3

4290879,11/27/2010 09:12:05,277826,02/20/2010 21:01:00,204,15,Linux: uploading unfinished files - with file size check (scp/rsync),"I typically end up in the following situation: I have, say, a 650 MB MPEG-2 .avi video file from a camera. Then, I use [ffmpeg2theora](http://v2v.cc/~j/ffmpeg2theora/) to convert it into Theora .ogv video file, say some 150 MB in size. Finally, I want to upload this .ogv file to an `ssh` server.

Let's say, the `ffmpeg2theora` encoding process takes some 15 minutes on my PC. On the other hand, the upload goes on with a speed of about 60 KB/s, which takes some 45 minutes (for the 150MB .ogv). So: if I first encode, and wait for the encoding process to finish - and then upload, it would take approximately

    15 min + 45 min = 1 hr

to complete the operation. 

So, I thought it would be better if I could somehow start the upload, _in parallel_ with the encoding operation; then, in principle - as the uploading process is slower (_in terms of transferred bytes/sec_) than the encoding one (_in terms of generated bytes/sec_) - the uploading process would always ""trail behind"" the encoding one, and so the whole operation (enc+upl) would complete in just 45 minutes (that is, just the time of the upload process +/- some minutes depending on actual upload speed situation on wire).  

My **first** idea was to pipe the output of `ffmpeg2theora` to `tee` (so as to keep a local copy of the .ogv) and then, pipe the output further to `ssh` - as in: 

    ./ffmpeg2theora-0.27.linux32.bin -v 8 -a 3 -o /dev/stdout MVI.AVI | tee MVI.ogv | ssh user@ssh.server.com ""cat > ~/myvids/MVI.ogv""

While this command does, indeed, function - one can easily see in the running log in the terminal from `ffmpeg2theora`, that in this case, `ffmpeg2theora` calculates a  predicted time of completion to be 1 hour; that is, there seems to be _no_ benefit in terms of smaller completion time for both enc+upl. (_While it is possible that this is due to network congestion, and me getting less of a network speed at the time - it  seems to me, that `ffmpeg2theora` has to wait for an acknowledgment for each little chunk of data it sends through the pipe, and that ACK finally has to come from `ssh`... Otherwise, `ffmpeg2theora` would not have been able to provide a completion time estimate. Then again, maybe the estimate is wrong, while the operation would indeed complete in 45 mins - dunno, never had patience to wait and time the process; I just get pissed at 1hr as estimate, and hit Ctrl-C ;) ..._)
  
  
My **second** attempt was to run the encoding process in one terminal window, i.e.:

    ./ffmpeg2theora-0.27.linux32.bin -v 8 -a 3 MVI.AVI      # MVI.ogv is auto name for output

..., and the uploading process, using `scp`, in another terminal window (thereby 'forcing' 'parallelization'): 

    scp MVI.ogv user@ssh.server.com:~/myvids/

The problem here is: let's say, at the time when `scp` starts, `ffmpeg2theora` has already encoded 5 MB of the output .ogv file. At this time, `scp` sees this 5 MB as the _entire_ file size, and starts uploading - and it exits when it encounters the 5 MB mark; while in the meantime, `ffmpeg2theora` may have produced additional 15 MB, making the .ogv file 20 MB in total size at the time `scp` has exited (_finishing the transfer of the first 5 MB_). 

Then I learned ([joen.dk » Tip: scp Resume](http://joen.dk/wordpress/?p=34)) that `rsync` supports 'resume' of partially completed uploads, as in:

    rsync --partial --progress myFile remoteMachine:dirToPutIn/

..., so I tried using `rsync` instead of `scp` - but it seems to behave exactly the same as `scp` in terms of file size, that is: it will only transfer up to the file size read at the beginning of the process, and then it will exit. 
  
  
So, my **question** to the community is: Is there a way to parallelize the encoding and uploading process, so as to gain the decrease in total processing time? 

I'm guessing there could be several ways, as in:

* A command line option (that I haven't seen) that forces `scp`/`rsync` to continuously check the file size - if the file is open for writing by another process (_then I could simply run the upload in another terminal window_)
* A bash script; say running `rsync --partial` in a `while` loop, that runs as long as the .ogv file is open for writing by another process (_I don't actually like this solution, since I can hear the harddisk scanning for the resume point, every time I run `rsync --partial` - which, I guess, cannot be good; if I know that the same file is being written to at the same time_)
* A different tool (other than `scp`/`rsync`) that does support upload of a ""currently generated""/""unfinished"" file (_the assumption being it can handle only growing files; it would exit if it encounters that the local file is suddenly less in size than the bytes already transferred_)

... but it could also be, that I'm overlooking something - and 1hr is as good as it gets (in other words, it is maybe logically impossible to achieve 45 min total time - even if trying to parallelize) :) 

Well, I look forward to comments that would, hopefully, clarify this for me ;) 

Thanks in advance,  
Cheers!

I'm guessing there could be several ways, as in:

* A command line option (that I haven't seen) that forces `scp`/`rsync` to continuously check the file size - if the file is open for writing by another process (_then I could simply run the upload in another terminal window_)
* A bash script; say running `rsync --partial` in a `while` loop, that runs as long as the .ogv file is open for writing by another process (_I don't actually like this solution, since I can hear the harddisk scanning for the resume point, every time I run `rsync --partial` - which, I guess, cannot be good; if I know that the same file is being written to at the same time_)
* A different tool (other than `scp`/`rsync`) that does support upload of a ""currently generated""/""unfinished"" file (_the assumption being it can handle only growing files; it would exit if it encounters that the local file is suddenly less in size than the bytes already transferred_)

... but it could also be, that I'm overlooking something - and 1hr is as good as it gets (in other words, it is maybe logically impossible to achieve 45 min total time - even if trying to parallelize) :) 

Well, I look forward to comments that would, hopefully, clarify this for me ;) 

Thanks in advance,  
Cheers!

I'm monitoring my outgoing traffic using libnetfilter_queue module and an iptables rule

A certain app, called Jitsi (which runs on Java) is exhibiting such a strange behaviour a haven't encountered before:
My monitoring program which process NFQUEUE packets clearly shows that UDP packets are being sent out,
yet when I look into:
""/proc/net/udp"" and ""/proc/net/udp6"" they are empty, moreover  ""/proc/net/protocols"" has a column ""sockets"" for UDP and it is 0.
But the UDP packets keep getting sent.
Then after a minute or so, ""/proc/net/udp"" and ""/proc/net/protocols"" begin to show the correct information about UDP packets.
And again after a while there is no information in them while the UDP packets are being sent.

My only conclusion is that somehow it is possible for an application to send UDP packets without creating a socket and/or it is possible create a socket, then delete it (so that kernel thinks there are none) and still use some obscure method to send packets outside.

I've been looking for a way to mount this filesystem similar to an ro mount option, but something that would still allow rw access to root, but I've had absolutely no luck.  In other words, I want users to be able to view and copy their backed up data without actually being able to change it, and have that data maintain the original permissions.

----------
I am a bit of a Linux noob :(

Problem:
-------
I have an interesting problem that I could use some help with.  Essentially, I want to overwrite the default actions for the ""Print Screen"" button in Linux.  My reasons for doing so are that I have a homemade graphics card running attached to the computer and I'm trying to make a utility where I can capture what it is outputting to a separate monitor and send it back to the ""host"" computer.  For purposes here, I only want to know:  **How can I execute a script upon pressing the Print Screen button?**  Note that I cannot install xbindkeys or any other software.  Ideally I would like to be able to run a script to enable this behavior.

Current work-around:
-------------------
Currently, I have a .bashrc script:

        #!/bin/bash
        export PATH=/home/username/bin:$PATH

In the **/home/username/bin** folder I have a script **""gnome-screenshot""** that, for now, just performs some arbitrary task (it actually does this:  **""cat /usr/share/icons/*/* > /dev/dsp""** -- try it!  It's fun!).

I am working on school computers, so I first CTRL-ALT-F5 to open a terminal login, login, then source .bashrc.  I then startx -- :1  to start a new X session.  Now, if I hit the PrintScreen button, it uses my gnome-screenshot, not the default screencapture program.

**Is there anyway to do this without all of the restarting X?  In short, is there a way to source my .bashrc script, or otherwise modify my PATH variable, *before or while* I login?**

Another Approach:
--------------
I also tried, briefly, to xmodmap and the keycode to execute a script, but couldn't figure out how to tie them together.  I know the keycode (111) but can't figure out how to run a script on press.  I believe it might be possible to make a sort of binding using this but can't figure out how.

Help!

I'd really appreciate some help or comments!

At some point I ran a chmod -R shell command on it to change the permissions. That was months ago and I don't remember what I typed but it made the drive so I could only access its /home folder as root. This wasn't a problem because I could still access everything, but today I decided to try to fix it.

I went to my shell as root, went to that drive and typed:

    chown -R rick:rick ./
    chmod -R 666 ./

It seemed to work.  That home directory and everything else in it now shows up as rw for each:

    drw-rw-rw- 7 rick rick 4096 2012-03-04 13:08 home

Thanks!",linux,folder,home,ext4,,05/13/2012 08:10:44,off topic,1,272,6,"Why can't I access this folder? A while back I bought a 1TB USB external drive. I formatted it ext4 in Ubuntu and copied a bunch of files / folders to it from several machines, all to /home/machinename/whatever, respectively.

At some point I ran a chmod -R shell command on it to change the permissions. That was months ago and I don't remember what I typed but it made the drive so I could only access its /home folder as root. This wasn't a problem because I could still access everything, but today I decided to try to fix it.

I went to my shell as root, went to that drive and typed:

    chown -R rick:rick ./
    chmod -R 666 ./

It seemed to work.  That home directory and everything else in it now shows up as rw for each:

    rick@rick64:/media/aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-eeeeeeeeeeee$ ls -l
    drw-rw-rw- 7 rick rick 4096 2012-03-04 13:08 home

-

I would love to have a multi user system (based on linux) using only one X11 session with multiple screens and pairs of mouse and keyboard. So two (or more) people can work with the same computer sharing not only the same hardware but also the same ""screen"" (which would be split into two physical screens of course, but you could move a window to your partner for example...). Sharing the windows should not only make it more convenient to ""show"" your partner what you have done - if user A started to work on something using a complex application (assert that it wouldn't be convenient to save the files and open them in the other session) moving the window of the application to user B should be as simple as moving a window within your own screen. That's why I call it a ""seamless"" multi user session.


Possible solutions
-

I read about **X11 ""multi seat""** in [this article](http://www.linuxtoys.org/multiseat/multiseat.html) which doesn't have the features that I want. It uses a session for each user rather than one single session.

I found [XI2](http://www.x.org/wiki/XI2) aka Xinput2 which provides a **multi-pointer** support. This allows having two separate mouse pointers controlled by two mice. I read that you can assign two keyboards to the two mice providing independant focus and text input. But I wonder if the clipboards (both ""real"" and ""middle mouse button"" clipboards) are treated separately too... I found only few information on XI2 multi pointer feature but no ""field report"".

Another, completely different idea would be having two separate X11 sessions on the computer but **share the windows using X11-forward** between the two sessions. BUT: As far as I know, you can not share a X11-forwarded window so that user A runs an application and while it runs, send the window to user B. As I know, only user B can run an application on the hardware of user A and display the window on it's own X11 session. That's again not what I want... Or am I wrong and it is possible to forward a window via X11-forwarding AFTER the application has been started?

None of these boxes are especially critical and they're all using RAID.  To date, I've therefore been doing backups of the boxes by having a cron job upload tarballs containing the contents of /etc, MySQL dumps and other such changing, non-packaged data to a box at our geographically separate hosting centre.

I've realised, however that

* the tarballs are sufficient to rebuild from, but it's certainly not a painless process to do so (I recently tried this out as part of a hardware upgrade of one of the boxes)
* long-term, the process isn't sustainable.  Each of the boxes is currently producing a tarball of a couple of hundred MB each day, 99% of which is the same as the previous day
* partly due to the size issue, the backup process requires more manual intervention than I want (to find whatever 5GB file is inflating the size of the tarball and kill it)
* again due to the size issue, I'm leaving stuff out which it would be nice to include - the contents of users' home directories, for example.  There's almost nothing of value there that isn't in source control (and these aren't our main dev boxes), but it would be nice to keep them anyway.
* there must be a better way

So, my question is, how should I be doing this properly?  The requirements are:

* needs to be an offsite backup (one of the main things I'm doing here is protecting against fire/whatever)
* should require as little manual intervention as possible (I'm lazy, and box-herding isn't my main job)
* should continue to scale with a couple more boxes, slightly more data, etc.
* preferably free/open source (cost isn't the issue, but especially for backups, openness seems like a good thing)
* an option to produce some kind of DVD/Blu-Ray/whatever backup from time to time wouldn't be bad

My first thought was that this kind of incremental backup was what tar was created for - create a tar file once each month, add incrementally to it.  rsync results to remote box.  But others probably have better suggestions.

I want this script to be portable enough so that users won't be required to update their `cp`.

What the `-n` flag does is copy only files from the source that are not already in the destination without prompting.

Is there an alternative to this?",2

The scenario is simple. I need to transfer some files from my linux server to a windows pc.

I can now mount (via a loopback-device) the increased filesystem and verify that my operation worked. The filesystem did not loose any data and where before the filesystem was full I now have an extra GB available - so that worked.

    ssh: connect to host 192.168.0.105 port 22: connection refused


Both trying to access it via LAN, and directly on the machine using ssh localhost. I have checked, the localhost loop is fine.

I've triple checked, it is the correct IP, because all these things are working; Apache, Samba, FTP, and a few other services i have running.

The router configuration i have messed with a bit, but port 22 is forwarded to the right IP. In this case 192.168.0.105.

    netstat -ln | grep 22

returns:

    tcp6    0    0 :::22      :::*      LISTEN

so i assume SSHD is running?

I have tried updating (hopefully not) everything, but googling have gotten me nowhere. I have tried uninstalling, and reinstalling both openssh-client and openssh-server from apt-get.

I have tried changing the DNS on the router, tried setting sshd_conf to `UseDNS no`

I don't know what to do. I am by no means capable in linux, it's just a tool for me, and right now - it's broken. 

I very much hope you can help me.

Thanks in advance,
Michael

`Plus, if I do not login, and SSH to a remote server then it is unable to connect. What happens in this case? I think it is not received by any service on the gateway.`

`Does the service do that check-session thing for every request?! Like 1000s of requests per second?`



Sorry for the long question, but I just thought I'd ask a bit clearly for others who have the same question can relate. Thanks. :)

Our team uses Mercurial as a versioning system. The setup is very simple: two developers (one linux, one windows), remote repo (linux). Every time, the windows user **W** checks in modifications and the linux user **L** wants to pull afterwards, the following error messages (depending on the altered file(s)) are displayed:

This is because the file access is handled by linux's ACL lists. After the ACL permissions are corrected with the `setfacl` command, everything runs smooth and **L** is able to pull. Even if **W** clones the repo with correct permission, the (new/ modified) files in the `.hg` directory have the wrong (default) permissions.

1) Is it the process's responsibility to unlink the files upon termination? If so, what if the process dies before it unlinks them?

2) Since I suspect the answer to #1 is ""yes, it's the program's responsibility"", is it considered ""good practice"" for my program to remove any stale files it notices before creating a new one, in case previous instances died uncleanly?

3) Is there a way to ask the kernel to remove the backing file after the last process unmaps the memory?

The time has come (or maybe it came long ago) for me to consider the cloud. But with the cloud come a few concerns (all arising out of my own ignorance) and I'm hoping StackOverflow can put my fears to rest.

While I've heard some answers to my questions in the past, I'm hoping to get enough feedback, and also hopefully provide a valuable resource to any others out there like me.

1) First off - how does it all work? I mean, I get the network of clouds, spinning them up and down as I need it. But until now, I've always opened up an FTP client, connected to my server and uploaded my website. My guess is this all works the same way with the cloud, but how is it all managed? How do I update files and how would I delete them? Would an FTP client suffice for the simple file-management of a website?

2) A lot of shared hosts use PHP4, and allow PHP5 with the right extension - how does this, and all the PHP extensions work? How would I turn on the mod_rewrite extension, for example? How would I select my version of PHP? Can I curl?

3) What about things like cron jobs, or administrating a mysql database? Can I access my database via a phpmyadmin interface, or via the MySQL Query Browser?

4) Lastly, how does the cost really compare to shared hosting? I know it all depends on traffic, so to phrase my question differently, where do the cost lines intersect (if at all?) For example, if I pay $100/month for a dedicated server, and can support 300,000 page visits, or 2-3 page visits per second, what would the cost be for similar usage?

The user can connect a keyboard, but not a monitor, and a serial console would require opening the case, something we don't want the user to have to do. This all pretty much obviates the possibility of using a recovery USB drive to boot from, unless all it does is blindly reimage the harddrive. I would like to provide some recovery facilities, and I have written a tool that comes up on /dev/tty1 in place of getty to provide these functions.

One such function is fsck. I have found out how to remount the root and other file systems read-only. Now that they are read-only, it should be safe to fsck them and then reboot. Unfortunately, fsck complains to me that the filesystems are mounted and refuses to do anything.

How can I force fsck to run on a read-only mounted partition?

Based on my research, this is going to have to be something obscure. ""-f"" just means to force repair of a clean (but unmounted) partition. I need to repair a clean or unclean mounted partition. From what I read, this is something ""only experts"" should do, but no one has bothered to explain how the experts do it.  I'm hoping someone can reveal this to me.

BTW, I've noticed that e2fsck 1.42.4 on Gentoo will let you fsck a mounted partition, even mounted read-write, but it seems only to do so if fsck is run from a terminal, so it can ask the user if they're sure they want to do something so dangerous.  I'm not sure if the CentOS version does the same thing, but it appears that fsck CAN repair a mounted partition, but it flatly refuses to when not run from a terminal.  

One last-resort option is for me to compile my own hacked fsck.  But I'm afraid I'll mess it up in some unexpected way.

Thanks!

I see that each filesystem has its own inode counts and these filesystems (like devtmpfs and tmpfs) are all mounted to [root file system][2]. I guess each filesystem have their own inode tables, but are inode numbers of different filesystems distributed in different ranges, like root filesystem is [0, N] and tmpfs is [N+1, M]?

If inode numbers of different filesystems are in different ranges (which I don't think so), how filesystems make an agreement on range division?

If inode numbers of different filesystems are generated based on the same rule (like all start from 0), can different filesystems conflict if we mount them together? As I know, inode presents files in running OS, what the OS will do if a file in root filesystem has inode number N and another file in another filesystem (like tmpfs) also has the inode number N?

PS. I'm kind of new to Linux and I'm not coming from a English-speaking country, sorry for if I didnot make clear expression. Thanks in advance.

I have several questions on how inode number is used in linux filesystem. These questions may be related but for clearness I will ask them one by one.

Q1: Take EXT2/3 for example, from ""[Design and Implementation of the Second Extended Filesystem][1]"" I know that there are inode tables in block groups, and I know inode presents file, but what if there are too many files but the inode numbers are not enough?
My best guess is that filesystem does nothing if all its inode numbers were exhausted. And if some file get deleted later, its inode may be recycled.

Q2: I run ""df -i"" on my Linux server and I get this:

I have some ISO images like: knoppix, debian, ubuntu, etc.

Is there any way to do the following procedure:

 1. List item
 2. load a micro kernel/bootloader from bootable memory stick into RAM
 3. load the most necessary modules to mount filesystem, iso, etc.
 4. boot directly from that iso.

I know that there are several solutions I've found but non of them are universal:

 1. **grub4dos** can load the whole image to ram and then boot it.
-> it's ok if the image is small, but if it has e.g. 4 GB of RAM than we should have at least 6-8GB to work properly.
 2. **grub2** can boot from iso, but we need to know exactly what's the syslinux parameters.
This is an example configuration of grub.cfg that I've prepared for my Knoppix ISO:

    	menuentry ""Knoppix"" {
		set isofile=""/boot/iso/knoppix.iso""
		echo ""Loading kernel..""
		loopback loop $isofile
		linux (loop)/boot/isolinux/linux64 boot=casper iso-scan/filename=$isofile ramdisk_size=100000 lang=en vt.default_utf8=0 acpi=off apm=power-off vga=791 nomce fromiso=$isofile noeject noprompt --
		echo ""Loading modified initrd..""
		initrd (loop)/boot/isolinux/minirt.gz
	}

The problem is that after kernel boots, the init process can not find the mounted files even if they are exist on my loopback mounted iso.

I was able to boot successfully some of my ISOs but that's not universal way. Sometimes it fails.

And what about Windows installer. Let say some of my friends who don't have any CD/DVD device want me to reinstall the system. Can I do that with the similar way?
Honestly I would probably solve that problem few years ago, but I've been working on Linux platform for many years and have contact with Windows-es only at work.

With `NonBlockingConnect`, most connect() operations are fast, but in every few seconds there happens to be one connect() operation which takes at least 2 seconds (as indicated by 5 consecutive `P` letters on the output).

With `NonBlockingConnect`, most connect() operations are fast, but in every few seconds there happens to be one connect() operation which takes at least 2 seconds (as indicated by 5 consecutive `P` letters on the output). By using `sock.connect` instead of `NonBlockingConnect` all connect operations seem to be fast.

How is it possible to get rid of these slow connect()s?

Additionally, heard of Linode (a private VPS) too but again not sure if that's what suits me best.

basically i need the ability for server to:

 - be linux (ubuntu) 
 - can ssh to it using the command line via putty (or any similar tool)
 - can ftp into it (using WinSCP/FileZilla to transfer files/docs over back and forth)
 - ability to have version control installed (preferably svn, git, or even cvs)
 - can install many linux based applications..
 - ability to install a project wiki (like Redmine) on it
 - ability to host websites (php-able etc..) i.e. a web-server
 - setting up sub-domains..
 - store files/resources..perhaps require a file-server too? (files/folders/multimedias)
 - ability to have databases (database server): MySQL and others...
 - optionally a mail server too: allowing the possibility for configuring mails..

*pricing is not important, but of course i will be leaning towards cheaper offers

I initially installed Backtrack side-by-side my Windows install successfully with defaulted settings (foolishly, I know), which automatically allocated 80 GB of my available Windows partition to that distro. It also installed Grub. 

I can live with that so long as it would be possible to take some of that allocated 80 GB towards another Linux distro, Matriux so that I could triple boot. However, after installing Backtrack, Grub will no longer allow me to boot from my CD media. It starts to read the disc, but then Grub kicks in and wants me to choose between my Windows 7 OS and my Backtrack distro. 

Now, I've scoured the web trying to find a solution and the following suggestions are repeatedly stated but will not work for me.

1) Replace CD/DVD drive: I know my CD/DVD drive is fine, I can load any disc without fail in any given, running OS/Distribution environment. I have loaded Matriux in a virtual environment from the CD as well which leads me to the second suggestion...

2) It's got to be a bad disc/burned iso: No, because I have booted from my burned disc successfully in the virtual environment and even successfully installed it in this virtual environment. The disc/iso I'm using is fine.

3) Check BIOS to make sure disc is default boot method: I've done this, and I've even selected to immediately boot from the disc drive as well from within my BIOS settings. No dice.

I feel like... if Grub wasn't managing my boot options, everything would be fine. I know I can restore the Windows boot loader by repairing it with a Windows installation disc, but I believe it also removes my Backtrack distro (given the circumstances, it might actually be the better choice...), but I was hoping there was a way I could just proceed on without any further complications and just install my Matriux distribution with Backtrack and Windows 7. Any advice you guys can give would be greatly appreciated... thank you :)

> **B** 10.10.51.183 (connected to router Y)

On server **A**, I created 1000 virtual interfaces:

    # ifconfig eth0:0 192.168.1.1 netmask 255.255.0.0  
    # ifconfig eth0:1 192.168.1.2 netmask 255.255.0.0  
    ....  
    # ifconfig eth0:999 192.168.5.200 netmask 255.255.0.0  

Each virtual interface is simulating a camera device, with camera simulation software.

On server **B**, I added the following route:

    # route add -net 192.168.0.0 netmask 255.255.0.0 eth0
And voila, **B** can access/ping the virtual interfaces of machine **A**.

Server **C** that is on a different subnet (10.10.60.0), added this route, but even I had super low hope for it to work: 

    # route add -net 192.168.0.0 netmask 255.255.0.0 eth0
As expected, I wasn't able to reach the virtual interfaces of server **A**, so I removed the route and added the following route using gateway ip of router **Y**:

    # route add -net 192.168.0.0 netmask 255.255.0.0 gw 10.10.51.1 eth0

In Windows, thigs are relativelly simple. You have GDI/GDI+. It handles all the subsequent operations from windows drawing and positiong to drawing buttons etc, right?

But in Linux I get pretty confused. Maybe you better understand where my confusion comes from if I explain my thoughts. So, first of Linux I read about its desktop managers. Gnome and KDE. So I picked KDE (for no specific reason) and learned it is based using Qt library. So I read about Qt library a bit more.

I first thought that Qt actually renders GI elements like buttons, sliders and so on. But when I saw example for Windows since its multiplatform, I realised it does no. It is using GDI for rendering. So the Linux version must use some Linux way to render UI elements. 

So if I am right, KDE uses Qt just to organise things, I would say in very simplistic way as layout manager, right? I assume this, if on Windows is it using GDI for rendering, its widely used just becouse its simpler and cleaner then directly manipulating GDI.

So from this point of view, Linux desktop (actually windows too) is ""just"" a window which is always fullscreen and cannot be minimised, shut down and so. It is using Qt for higher level of rendering basic UI elements. But that means there is another deeper layer under Qt library. I read about X system and its window managers. Are X window managers the layer that renders UI elements (buttons and so on) ? Becouse if I am right, X system is ""just"" a graphical interface between upper levels and graphical subsystem of PC. Something like GDI use DirectDraw to access framebuffer etc...

In Windows this whole stack seems more compact, I am NOT saying it is better, becouse GDI seems to be in role of Window manager and UI elements renderer together. I believe this is why advanced UI interfaces (Compiz...) are developed for Linux.

http://book.chinaunix.net/special/ebook/Linux_Kernel_Development/0672327201/ch14lev1sec2.html
explains how the VMA (virtual memory areas) works in linux kernel. This is part of memory management subsystem, which manages memory of user-space process (`mmap`, virtual memory to physical memory and to page cache mappings, munmap, etc.)

I want to learn how it works, but seems, the book is outdated and describes not a real linux kernel.  E.g. it says in section ""VMA Operations""

     struct page * nopage(struct vm_area_sruct *area,
                     unsigned long address,
                     int unused)
     int populate(struct vm_area_struct *area,
        unsigned long address,
        unsigned long len, pgprot_t prot,
        unsigned long pgoff, int nonblock)

But there are no `nopage` or `populate` functions in the current kernel (checked 2.6.0, 2.6.11, 2.6.28, 3.0.3 versions).

**1st Q.** Can you recommend me good documentation about VMA in linux? Like it was described in the book (linked in second line of my question), but not outdated.

I want to know, how anonymous `mmap(...""/dev/zero""...)` and `brk` will zero memory, when it will be mapped into writable physical page, how the page fault handler works on it (when it helps mmap to populate the memory page). There are some of my questions about this:

**2nd Q.** For example, if I do an anonymous `mmap` of 1 MB and will write to it sequentially (from byte 0 up to byte 1024*1024-1), how much page faults will program have? 

**3rd Q.** If I do a `sbrk` of +1 MB, and will write to every byte of this memory, how much page faults will I get?

**4th Q.** I did an `sbrk` of +1 MB; then I wrote to this memory (at this moment I don't count page faults); then I did `sbrk(-1MB)`, waited some time, and ask `sbrk` of +512 KB. How much page faults will I have on writes to memory, allocated in third sbrk? Is memory from 3rd `sbrk` zeroed or not?

I want to learn how it works, but seems, the book is outdated and describes not a real linux kernel.  E.g. it says in section ""VMA Operations""

     struct page * nopage(struct vm_area_sruct *area,
                     unsigned long address,
                     int unused)
     int populate(struct vm_area_struct *area,
        unsigned long address,
        unsigned long len, pgprot_t prot,
        unsigned long pgoff, int nonblock)

But there are no `nopage` or `populate` functions in the current kernel (checked 2.6.0, 2.6.11, 2.6.28, 3.0.3 versions).

**1st Q.** Can you recommend me good documentation about VMA in linux? Like it was described in the book (linked in second line of my question), but not outdated.

I want to know, how anonymous `mmap(...""/dev/zero""...)` and `brk` will zero memory, when it will be mapped into writable physical page, how the page fault handler works on it (when it helps mmap to populate the memory page). There are some of my questions about this:

**2nd Q.** For example, if I do an anonymous `mmap` of 1 MB and will write to it sequentially (from byte 0 up to byte 1024*1024-1), how much page faults will program have? 

**3rd Q.** If I do a `sbrk` of +1 MB, and will write to every byte of this memory, how much page faults will I get?

**4th Q.** I did an `sbrk` of +1 MB; then I wrote to this memory (at this moment I don't count page faults); then I did `sbrk(-1MB)`, waited some time, and ask `sbrk` of +512 KB. How much page faults will I have on writes to memory, allocated in third sbrk? Is memory from 3rd `sbrk` zeroed or not?

If you want to answer Questions 2..4, consider x86 platform with 2 GB of memory. Linux kernel version is 2.6.38 (ubuntu natty).",5

Now whenever I launch the application it asks me to set the DISPLAY variable which I set to :0.0  but still it fails with errors

Before setting the display variable the error message was: 
java.lang.internal error: Cannot connect to X11 Windows Server with empty DISPLAY variable

after setting DISPLAY variable:
java.lang.internalError: Can't connect to X11 window server using ':0.0' as the value of the DISPLAY variable

And all these errors started popping up after the reboot. Not sure if its a case of a service that I have to run on my server end to allow it to access my Cygwin or Xming windows Server locally. Let me know what suggestions you guys have.

Thanks

What I would like to have happen is the following:
Every time the machine starts, the Minecraft server is started. (I have the shell commands already written for this.)
At 8:00 AM, the text ""stop"" is submitted to the server to cause it to gracefully stop.
At 8:01 AM, the computer restarts.

Ideally, this will open a window on my desktop that enter commands into, and also have a way to send commands to the server through a remote terminal.

What I would like to have happen is the following:
Every time the machine starts, the Minecraft server is started. (I have the shell commands already written for this.)
At 8:00 AM, the text ""stop"" is submitted to the server to cause it to gracefully stop.
At 8:01 AM, the computer restarts.

Ideally, this will open a window on my desktop that enter commands into, and also have a way to send commands to the server through a remote terminal.

I have hard drive dump files that I want to burn onto a bootable live Linux disc. The disc would boot to a command line and run a script to copy the dump down to a hard drive in the machine. I don't need a desktop environment. I don't need a lot of unnecisary utilities. Pretty much all my ""restore"" script will need is utilities for mounting, partitioning the hard drive, copying files, and seting up netork interfaces... all pretty basic stuff.

**So here's a summary of what I need**

 - I want a live bootable disc.
 - It needs to be a Blu-Ray disc (the dump files are very large and won't fit on a DVD. But if someone has a tutorial that includes everything but this one element, I'm sure I can figure out the rest)
 - I want just a command line and basic utilities
 - It needs to be RHEL (exact version isn't as important, but 5.4 is what I'm shooting for)
 - I'm looking for a *procedure*, not a ready-made product. I need to be able to reproduce this often with different dump files.

**My Problems:**
A lot of the information I've found online so far has had pretty much one of three problems:

 1. *Uses some other distro.* By itself, this is not a big problem, as most things are transferrable, but usually it's this plus one of the two below
 2. *Uses 3rd party tools.* I really can't use any non-standard 3rd party tools. Anything I'd have to go out and download would force me to go through a lot of red tape and it's not really something I want to do. I'm looking for a procedure that just uses built-in stuff.
 2. *Not minimal.* There are a lot of tutorials out there for a full ""Desktop"" live OS, which is not what I need. I just need a command line and basic functionality, and I'm not experienced enough to strip out the stuff I don't need. It's much easier to start with a base, find out I'm missing a package I need, add it to the installation, and re-burn the CD.

I have found one path that looks promising... It involves using something called [livecd-creator][1] which as far as I can tell, looks like somthing that I can use without any hassle. It seems to do what I'd need, but relys on kickstart configuration files, which aren't something I'm too familliar with. If someone out there can whip up a kickstart configuration file that does what I'm looking for, I'm sure I can figure out how to use livecd-creator. Maybe that's a start?

So, as I've said, I've done a lot of searching so far and haven't found exactly what I'm looking for. I'm hoping someone out there can either (a) Point me to an existing tutorial and note what I need to do to account for differences, or (b) create something new for me. If anyone can, I'd greatly appreciatiate it. And like I said above, I'm sure I can figure out the Blu-Ray aspect of it, if someone has a tutorial that covers everything else that I'm looking for.

Hopefully I've been specific enough to avoid any wild goose chases. I see a lot of the same links posted in response to quesitons like mine. I'm hoping if I'm specific about exactly what I'm looking for, I'll get more specific responses. Fingers crossed.

Thanks in advance everybody...

Any idea what is going wrong? Currently I am using Qwt 0.4.1(4.1) and I think Qwt 5.x version were released with lot of new additions. So wanted to try but I am not unable to get it complied.

I found that only Qwt 5.0.1 and Qwt 5.0.2 were compatible with Qt 3.1 and I am also tried compling Qwt 5.0.2 and had the same error. It was not able to find something in qwt_paint_buffer.cpp

And in my research I found what all version of Qwt is compatiable with which version of Qt. So here is the list.

Till Qwt 5.0.1 -> Qt 3.x and Qt 4.x+ is supportted

Any idea what is going wrong? Currently I am using Qwt 0.4.1(4.1) and I think Qwt 5.x version were released with lot of new additions. So wanted to try but I am not unable to get it complied.

I found that only Qwt 5.0.1 and Qwt 5.0.2 were compatible with Qt 3.1 and I am also tried compling Qwt 5.0.2 and had the same error. It was not able to find something in qwt_paint_buffer.cpp

And in my research I found what all version of Qwt is compatiable with which version of Qt. So here is the list.

I've searched for the solution and tried many things: tweaking filter in lvm.conf, partitioning the drbd device, etc.. but none worked. Moreover, I've actually set up such system successfully just a week before. But now when the servers had to be re-configured with RAID-1 and re-installed, the old settings stopped working. 

This is the filter line I'm using:

	filter = [ ""a|/dev/lvm/drbd|"", ""a|/dev/drbd|"", ""r/.*/"" ]


While investigating further, I found that when vgcreate command was used to create Volume Group over Physical Volume already sitting on DRBD device ( /dev/drbd0, /dev/lvm/drbd0 ), the device reference from pvs fell to ( /dev/sda8 ), the device underlying DRBD. Even weirder is that result from pvscan still showed as DRBD device.

If I then removed the VG, result from pvs went back to showing DRBD device. Then I created VG again, and it becomes /dev/sda8 again.

I've searched for the solution and tried many things: tweaking filter in lvm.conf, partitioning the drbd device, etc.. but none worked. Moreover, I've actually set up such system successfully just a week before. But now when the servers had to be re-configured with RAID-1 and re-installed, the old settings stopped working. 

This is the filter line I'm using:

	filter = [ ""a|/dev/lvm/drbd|"", ""a|/dev/drbd|"", ""r/.*/"" ]


While investigating further, I found that when vgcreate command was used to create Volume Group over Physical Volume already sitting on DRBD device ( /dev/drbd0, /dev/lvm/drbd0 ), the device reference from pvs fell to ( /dev/sda8 ), the device underlying DRBD. Even weirder is that result from pvscan still showed as DRBD device.

If I then removed the VG, result from pvs went back to showing DRBD device. Then I created VG again, and it becomes /dev/sda8 again.

I have a CUPS (1.4.2) server on a RHEL 6.1 box, all clients are running Fedora 13 or 14.  

The server cups.foo.com is listed in the client's config:

BrowsePoll cups.foo.com

Usually when I run lpstat -t I see the printers I have setup from the server as just:

printer fooabcps is idle.  enabled since blah blah.

On some clients though running lpstat -t I see:

printer fooabcps@cups.foo.com is idle.  enabled since blah blah.

Where the printer has an @ followed by the server fqdn.  This is annoying for users because their default printer is no longer recognized and when they print without the domain name it doesn't work:

lp -d fooabcps file.txt

I searched around but I cannot figure out what could be going on here.  The cups logs aren't very helpful, wondering if maybe someone else has seen this.

I'm using Ubuntu 10.04 server, OpenSSH is installed standard via package.  I have this running on a dozen other machines in this exact format, and they are virtuals so they are even on the same hardware!

I'm using putty on the windows side for a client.  I'm using pub/private key.  

So what happens is one of two things:

1. Right off the bat putty says ""network error connection refused"".  I've had this happen up to around 8 times in a row, but RARELY.  All other services on machine are still responding without issue, so I know the machine has network connectivity.

2. More commonly, it lets you in, and after a while it will just drop connection.  Same as above, everything is still function, it just seems to be SSH. 

3. Last night, I left a connection up when I left work, and it stayed up ALL NIGHT.  That's the only time I've seen a connection to this server stay as long as it did.

I've updated the OS.  My next step is to turn on verbose logging in SSH and see if that brings anything to light.  Does anyone have any suggestions on how to debug this, or have you seen this before?

Thanks Stackers!!!!

When I upload a file, it does not overwrite the original, but instead gets renamed as [original file.ext].1 (or [file].2, if [file].1 already exists). For example, if style.css exist on the server, and I download and edit it, when I upload it back into position it gets “renamed” as **style.css.1**. Doing the attempt a second time produces a third file called **style.css.2**.

I own my own iron, upon which I have OpenSUSE 11.4 64-bit installed (a relatively recent install, just configured). I am making use of pure-ftpd and use the YAST control panel to manipulate the settings. The Umask (umask files:umask dirs) setting in particular is set to 000:000 (the only setting which will give an uploaded file the same permissions as existing files). I have Chrooted ftp access for everyone, and in order for FTP to access /srv/www/, I have used the instructions on [this site][1] to mount /srv/www/ inside /home/[user]/ftp/ using the bind operation. Ergo, FTP access is chrooted for a very secure user, but the user still has access to content within /srv/www/.

I have also taken the time to give the contents of /srv/www/ the same permissions and user:group as the user itself (i.e., there should be NO permissions issues).

I am using WS_FTP Pro 2007 to access the site, as well as Notepad++ (via NppFTP), and both clients have the same problem: I can download files just fine, but when I upload them they have “.#” appended to them (.1, .2, .3, etc.) instead of overwriting the original file. These new files have the IDENTICAL permissions and ownership (user:group) as the original file, so I am totally in the dark as to why the upload creates a new file instead of overwriting.

I am on Linux 2.6.x, running with root-rights and using pthreads to do parallel things in a timing critical application written in C/C++.

I'll try to give some short, boiled down, snippets to explain my question:

In main I somewhere at the beginning do:

    struct sched_param sp;
    memset(&sp, 0, sizeof(sched_param));
    sp.sched_priority = 99;
    sched_setscheduler(getpid(), SCHED_RR, &sp);

I understand this to be the code that switches my program to use the RR-Scheduler, running at max. priority.

When starting a pthread, I do:

    sched_param param;
    pthread_attr_setinheritsched(&attr, PTHREAD_EXPLICIT_SCHED);
    pthread_attr_getschedparam(&attr, &param);
    param.sched_priority = priority;
    pthread_attr_setschedpolicy(&attr, SCHED_RR);
    pthread_attr_setschedparam(&attr, &param);

I understand this, to be the code that switches the thread that's gonna be started to RR-Scheduler, using the priority given in 'priority'. 
Is that going to work equivalently if main would **not** switch the scheduler?

What I do not understand is, if it is necessary to call that code in main? (The main-function does not do anything than starting everything and then block on keyboard input.)
Where can I find precise documentation of how this works. I don't think the manpages do a good job on explaining the background.

I am on Linux 2.6.x, running with root-rights and using pthreads to do parallel things in a timing critical application written in C/C++.

I'll try to give some short, boiled down, snippets to explain my question:

In main I somewhere at the beginning do:

    struct sched_param sp;
    memset(&sp, 0, sizeof(sched_param));
    sp.sched_priority = 99;
    sched_setscheduler(getpid(), SCHED_RR, &sp);

I understand this to be the code that switches my program to use the RR-Scheduler, running at max. priority.

When starting a pthread, I do:

    sched_param param;
    pthread_attr_setinheritsched(&attr, PTHREAD_EXPLICIT_SCHED);
    pthread_attr_getschedparam(&attr, &param);
    param.sched_priority = priority;
    pthread_attr_setschedpolicy(&attr, SCHED_RR);
    pthread_attr_setschedparam(&attr, &param);

I understand this, to be the code that switches the thread that's gonna be started to RR-Scheduler, using the priority given in 'priority'. 
Is that going to work equivalently if main would **not** switch the scheduler?

What I do not understand is, if it is necessary to call that code in main? (The main-function does not do anything than starting everything and then block on keyboard input.)
Where can I find precise documentation of how this works. I don't think the manpages do a good job on explaining the background.

Thanks in advance.

I know that that's not the way it's usually done, but the application requires all data in one place, so I'm installing it into /opt, like many other proprietary software packages do. I will eventually provide deb and rpm packages, but it will only be .tar.gz for now. The user should extract it somewhere and it should work. I'd rather not have an installer.

First my questions, then the details:

1. How do other people package proprietary software for Linux?
2. Are there tools for packaging software including shared libraries?

Now for some details: This is my project's (I call it *foo* for this purpose) layout:

- foo (binary)
- config.ini
- data

Now in the package, there will be two additional elements:

- libs
- foo.sh

*libs* will contain all the shared libraries the project requires, and *foo.sh* is a script that sets LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include *libs*. Therefore, the user will execute *foo.sh* and the program should start.

I have a shell script that packages the software in the following steps:

1. Create empty directory and copy foo.sh to it
2. Invoke the build process and *make install* into the new directory
3. Copy shared libs from the filesystem
4. Package everything as .tar.gz

What do you think of this? There are some problems with this approach:

- I have to hard code all dependencies twice (once in CMake, once in the packaging script)
- I have to define the version number twice (once in the source code, once in the packaging script)

I don't know if this is useful. But nothing in /boot is that larger, other like /boot/vmlinuz-3.0.0-12 is 4.6M.

There are also 
<linux src root>/arch/x86/boot/vmlinuz.bin 4.5M
<linux src root>/arch/x86/boot/bzImage 4.5M

How do I rename the kernel and install it and update the grub.cfg?

It is so hard the find the information!

Thanks!

It looks like we should behave differently when parallel running is disabled or enabled. In first case, we should care about symlinks ourselves. In second case, we should delegate it to insserv.

If I am an administrator for a remote Suse server, how do I install packages from the command line? (Not using a GUI and preferably installing from a central repo)

set imap_pass = XXXX

Which is obviously not secure. I looked at this

https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Mutt#Passwords_management
and
http://www.mail-archive.com/mutt-users@mutt.org/msg36375.html

For guidance on how to encrypt the data. Neither solution worked for me though. The Arch linux one seems ideal because I would rather not use a wrapper everytime I start Mutt.

I did ""gpg --gen-key"" and set name to ""John Doe"", email to ""JDoe@example.com"" and comment to ""XXX"". 

I created a file with this data 

set EMAIL_PASS = random30digitpassword

I tried encrypting my file with 

gpg -e -r ""John Doe"" ./password

Now if I want to decrypt it should just work without a prompt because I am the one with the keystore but alas if I execute this following command it still prompts for a password

gpg2 -dq password.gpg

Not only did that not work but with this as my Mutt config:

source ""gpg2 -dq /home/John/password.gpg | ""

set imap_user   = JohnDoe@lavabit.com

set imap_pass = XXXX

Which is obviously not secure. I looked at this

https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Mutt#Passwords_management
and
http://www.mail-archive.com/mutt-users@mutt.org/msg36375.html

For guidance on how to encrypt the data. Neither solution worked for me though. The Arch linux one seems ideal because I would rather not use a wrapper everytime I start Mutt.

I did ""gpg --gen-key"" and set name to ""John Doe"", email to ""JDoe@example.com"" and comment to ""XXX"". 

I created a file with this data 

set EMAIL_PASS = random30digitpassword

I tried encrypting my file with 

gpg -e -r ""John Doe"" ./password

Now if I want to decrypt it should just work without a prompt because I am the one with the keystore but alas if I execute this following command it still prompts for a password

gpg2 -dq password.gpg

Not only did that not work but with this as my Mutt config:

source ""gpg2 -dq /home/John/password.gpg | ""

set folder      = imaps://lavabit.com/

If you're familiar with AutoHotkey or AutoIT on Windows, then you know exactly the kind of features I need, with the level of complexity. If you aren't familiar, then here's a small code snippet of how easy it is to use AHK:

    InputBox, varInput, Please enter some random text...
    Run, notepad.exe
    WinWaitActive, Untitled - Notepad
    SendInput, %varInput%
    SendInput, !f{Up}{Enter}{Enter}
    WinWaitActive, Save
    SendInput, SomeRandomFile{Enter}
    MsgBox, Your text`, %varInput% has been saved using notepad!

    #n::Run, notepad.exe


Now the above example, although a bit pointless, is a demo of the sort of functionality and simplicity I'm looking for. Here's an explanation for those who don't speak AHK:

----Start of Explanation of Code ----

 - Asks user to input some text and stores it in varInput
 - Runs notepad.exe
 - Waits till window exists and is active
 - Sends the contents of varInput as a series of keystrokes
 - Sends keystrokes to go to File -> Exit
 - Waits till the ""Save"" window is active
 - Sends some more keystrokes
 - Shows a Message Box with some text and the contents of a variable

 - Registers a hotkey, Win+N, which when pressed executes notepad.exe

----End of Explanation----

So as you can understand, the features are quite obvious: Ability to *easily* simulate keyboard and mouse functions, read input, process and display output, execute programs, manipulate windows, register hotkeys, etc.. all being done without requiring any #includes, unnecessary brackets, class declarations etc. In short: Simple.

Now I've played around a bit with Perl and Python, but its definitely no AHK. They're great for more advanced stuff, but surely, there has to be some tool out there for easy GUI automation?


PS: I've already tried running AHK with Wine but sending keystrokes and hotkeys don't work.",linux,gui,automation,autohotkey,scripting,01/10/2012 23:32:09,off topic,1,323,7,"Easy to use AutoHotkey/AutoIT alternatives for Linux I'm looking for recommendations for an easy-to-use GUI automation/macro platform for Linux.
