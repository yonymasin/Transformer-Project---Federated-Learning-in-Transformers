However, I am not getting very good test results with this. Am I doing anything wrong?

For example 

    function [randparam] = arraycode

    % randparam is now a 1x1001 vector.

    function simulation 
    
    x = constant + constant * randparam + constant

    end

What makes this difficult for me is because of the return command in the simulation function, it only calculates one step of the equation x above, returns the result into another function, call it integrator, and then the integrator function will call simulation function again to calculate x. 

so the integrator function might look like

    function integrator (x)

    u = y+10
    yy = simulation(x) * 10 + u

As you can see, integrator function calls the simulation function twice. which creates two problems for me:

 1. If I create a for loop in the simulation function where I input element by element using   something like: 

    for i = 1:100
        
    x = constant + constant * randparam(i) + constant

    end

then every time my integrator function calls my simulation function again, my for loop starts at 1 all over again.

 

 2.If I some how kept i in my base workspace so that my for loop in my simulation function    would know to step up from 1, then my y and yy functions would have different x inputs because as soon as it would be called the second time for yy, then i would now be i+1 thanks to the call due to y. 

Is there a way to avoid for loops in this scenario? One potential solution to problem number two is to duplicate the script but with a different name, and have my for loop use a different variable, but that seems rather inefficient.

So does anyone have any idea how I can code the linprog optimisation to get the optimum x's from the set of K's and M's.
Do I need some sort of for loop?",4

I have a fair amount of data that needs to be displayed on one graph. Two theoretical lines that are bold and solid are displayed on top, then 10 experimental data sets that converge to these lines are graphed, each using a different identifier (eg the + or o or a square etc). These graphs are on a log scale that goes up to 1e6. The first few decades of the graph (< 1e3) look fine, but as all the datasets converge (> 1e3) it's really difficult to see what data is what. 

There's over 1000 data points points per decade which I can prune linearly to an extent, but if I do this too much the lower end of the graph will suffer in resolution. 

What I'd like to do is prune logarithmically, strongest at the high end, working back to 0. My question is: **how can I get a logarithmically scaled index vector rather than a linear one?**

My initial assumption was that as my data is lenear I could just use a linear index to prune, which lead to something like this (but for all decades):

    //%grab indicies per decade
    ind12 = find(y >= 1e1 & y <= 1e2);
    indlow = find(y < 1e2);
    indhigh = find(y > 1e4);
    ind23 = find(y >+ 1e2 & y <= 1e3);
    ind34 = find(y >+ 1e3 & y <= 1e4);
    
    //%We want ind12 indexes in this decade, find spacing
    tot23 = round(length(ind23)/length(ind12));
    tot34 = round(length(ind34)/length(ind12));
    
    //%grab ones to keep
    ind23keep = ind23(1):tot23:ind23(end);
    ind34keep = ind34(1):tot34:ind34(end);
     
    indnew = [indlow' ind23keep ind34keep indhigh'];
    
    loglog(x(indnew), y(indnew));

But this causes the prune to behave in a jumpy fashion obviously. Each decade has the number of points that I'd like, but as it's a linear distribution, the points tend to be clumped at the high end of the decade on the log scale.

**Is it common/useful to generate an anti-aliased boolean mask for CCD image integration purposes ?**


Let's imagine that I want to integrate the light that strikes a given area of a CCD sensor. The boundaries of this area correspond to physical coordinates that have no obligation to coincide exactly with the pixels of my CCD sensor.

In Matlab/Octave/(or even Scientific Python), the common algorithm used for integrating such an area is to define a boolean mask using a logical operation on an array, such as:

        mask = R < radius;
(where 'R', and therefore 'mask', are 2D arrays and 'radius' is a float).
Such a mask has values of 0 or 1.

I can then integrate the pixels that are comprised within the boundaries of my area by summing the masked image:

        integrated_signal = sum(sum(mask.*image));
(where 'image' is the output of the CCD sensor, a 2D array with U16 values for instance).

However, mathematically speaking, nothing would prevent me from defining a continuous-valued mask, that is, a mask whose pixels could take any value between 0 and 1. Physically, this means that I could integrate portions of pixels.
I could even compute such a mask using an anti-aliasing algorithm in order to create better approximations of non-square-friendly shapes such as circles (for integrating a signal with revolution symmetry, let's say).

I have tested the program in Matlab 2008 and 2010 where it gives error of a different kind I have installed X64 Compilers and Tools and my system has Visual Studio2008 and 2010 with SDK7 and 6.1. Also, on doing MEX setup I get the following options
Select a compiler: 

    [1] Microsoft Software Development Kit (SDK) 7.1 in c:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0 
    [2] Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Express in c:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0 
     
    [0] None 
     
    Compiler: 1

This also returns the error Error in ==> untitled at 5
loadlibrary(...

I am perplexed at what to do as this problem is persistently appearing. I even followed the thread in [link][1] where tit mentions that 2011 supports load library. So,why does it not work?Please help.

is the time step axis. I need to compute sum of squared differences of elements from this 3D data for different types of lags and time differences. Lag is the distance between two data points while time difference is the difference between time steps. 

**Three types of lags are:**
 
 **`Row_Lag`:** Difference between different row numbers but keeping the column numbers same i.e. `Row_Lag=(Row#2-Row#1)`. For above matrix dimensions, `Row_lag will` vary from `1 till 50`.
 
 **`Col_Lag`:** Difference between different column numbers but keeping the row numbers same i.e. `Col_Lag=(Col#2-Col#1)`. For above matrix dimensions, `Col_lag` will vary from `1 till 50`.
 
 **`Angle_Lag`:** Difference between different column numbers and different row numbers i.e. `Angle_Lag=sqrt((Row#2-Row#1)^2+(Col#2-Col#1)^2)`
 
Sum of squared differences of elements ***for each of above three lags*** at ***various time difference*** (`t_lag`) is required to be computed. 

**Various time difference are:**

 **`t_lag=0:`** in which case lags are computed on same image i.e.
 (image1), (image2),...,(image20).
 
 **`t_lag=1:`** in which case lags are computed between consecutive images i.e.
 (image1 and image2), (image2 and image3),...,(image19 and image20).

I am kind of new at this Matlab. I am trying to populate a matrix/vector with ‘returns’ of a particular stock from the Yahoo Finance servers. If I call passing the desired stock market symbol in this get_hist_stock function:

I want the first column, say M and the second column, say D to

control the entire matrix to result to one row matrix depending

on the following condition:

the program will ask the user to enter the values of M then D as follows:


    M = input(' ENTER M VALUE =  ') ;
    
    D = input(' ENTER D VALUE =  ') ;

Now, the output will be the corresponding 2 values to M and D .

and these two values will be taken from the third column,

for example:

if M = 1  and  D = 2 , the output is B = 10 ; 11

another example:

if M = 3  and  D = 1 , the output is B = 18 ; 15

data and this will take very long time since M values will be up to 15

and N values will be up to 35 and for simplicity I posted the above small example.

 - without using the `imrotate` function, since it is part of the Image Processing Toolbox,
 - with the `loose` parameter, wich means the size of the output differs from the size of the input image,
 - and with a not too slow function compared to `imrotate`.

The signature of the function would be:

`imOutput = my_imrotate(imInput, theta_degres, interpolation, bbox)`

where:

 - `interpolation` would be `bilinear`, `bicubic` or `nearest`,
 - `bbox` would be `crop`, or `loose`.

I have already found [a function](http://www.johnloomis.org/ece563/notes/geom/warp/imrotate.m.html) in order to do this (just replace `imshow` and `bestblk` with your own functions in order not to use the toolbox), yet it is **really slow** for large images.

My approach would try to avoid making loops and relying as much as possible on `interp2`. My idea is to compute the size of a frame which would contain the original image as well as the rotated image, and then:

 1. pad the original image so as to have an image which size is the size of the frame,
 2. use `interp2` on the padded image,
 3. crop the resulting image so as to have the rotated image without the remaining padding.

I already have a good result with the `crop` parameter, but I cannot manage to find the offset for the `loose` parameter.

Here is the code for the `crop` parameter, where `Z` is the input and `Zi` is the output:

    Z = double(imInput);
    sz = size(Z);
    [X,Y] = meshgrid(1:sz(2), 1:sz(1));
    % Center
    c = sz/2;
    % Angle
    t = theta_degres*pi/180;
    % Rotation
    ct = cos(t);
    st = sin(t);
    Xi = c(1) + ct*(X-c(1))-st*(Y-c(2));
    Yi = c(2) + st*(X-c(1))+ct*(Y-c(2));
    % Rotation
    Zi = interp2(X, Y, Z, Xi, Yi);

To get the size of the rotated image with the `loose parameter`, I compute the `rotation_matrix` and call `rotate_points` on the coordinates of the corners `p` of the input image:

    rotate_points = @(p) bsxfun(@plus, c', rotation_matrix * bsxfun(@minus, p, c)')';

Any help would be highly appreciated.

 - `bbox` would be `crop`, or `loose`.

I have already found [a function](http://www.johnloomis.org/ece563/notes/geom/warp/imrotate.m.html) in order to do this (just replace `imshow` and `bestblk` with your own functions in order not to use the toolbox), yet it is **really slow** for large images.

My approach would try to avoid making loops and relying as much as possible on `interp2`. My idea is to compute the size of a frame which would contain the original image as well as the rotated image, and then:

 1. pad the original image so as to have an image which size is the size of the frame,
 2. use `interp2` on the padded image,
 3. crop the resulting image so as to have the rotated image without the remaining padding.

I already have a good result with the `crop` parameter, but I cannot manage to find the offset for the `loose` parameter.

Here is the code for the `crop` parameter, where `Z` is the input and `Zi` is the output:

    Z = double(imInput);
    sz = size(Z);
    [X,Y] = meshgrid(1:sz(2), 1:sz(1));
    % Center
    c = sz/2;
    % Angle
    t = theta_degres*pi/180;
    % Rotation
    ct = cos(t);
    st = sin(t);
    Xi = c(1) + ct*(X-c(1))-st*(Y-c(2));
    Yi = c(2) + st*(X-c(1))+ct*(Y-c(2));
    % Rotation
    Zi = interp2(X, Y, Z, Xi, Yi);

To get the size of the rotated image with the `loose parameter`, I compute the `rotation_matrix` and call `rotate_points` on the coordinates of the corners `p` of the input image:

    rotate_points = @(p) bsxfun(@plus, c', rotation_matrix * bsxfun(@minus, p, c)')';

Any help would be highly appreciated.

for example, this is the plate after cutting it from the image and after filtering:
