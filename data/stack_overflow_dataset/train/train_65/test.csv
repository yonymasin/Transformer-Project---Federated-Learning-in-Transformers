the problem is i would like to detect the pupil of the eye, so i need to detect black color in the image, but i have no idea how to modified the code to change it able to detect black color. So, any idea to this? please help me, thanks you all.

Can I set headers (column titles) in a dataset, without entering data into the dataset yet? I guess not, so the 2nd part of the question would be:  
Can I make a one-row dataset, in which I name the headers, with empty data, and overwrite it later?

Let me show you what I was trying, but did not work:

dmsdb = dataset({ 'John','Name'},{'Amsterdam','City'},{10,'number' });  
produces:  
    Name    City         number  
    John    Amsterdam    10 --> Headers are good!  

Problem is, that when I am going to add more data to the dataset, it expects all strings to be of the same length. So I use cellstr():

dmsdb(1,1:3) = dataset({ cellstr('John'),'Name'},{cellstr('Amsterdam'),'City'},{10,'number' });

Currently i am working on the physics of it, and while i understand the mechanics behind the game (collisions, inertia and whatnot) i don't know how i will implement it in the game. I am new to programming but i like it and have caught on to it fairly quickly.

In angry birds we are dealing with collisions between several OBB's and i have an algorithm for detecting collisions. I have a function that checks all the corners of every box and looks to see if it is within another box. I realize this is not the best way to do it but since i couldn't visualize the separating axis theorem, i chose not to use it.

When the collision happens, the box is penetrating into another box, when this happens i do a liner interpolation between its previous point and the current point. I do this to all colliding points in one instance (this is my method to resolve multiple collisions). Using the interpolation i detect the first collision that takes place and i implement a collision response. 

My issue currently is that when there is one box sitting on top of another, this method doesnt work so well, because at every instance the top box penetrates into the bottom one very slightly, and i bounce it back. This causes my entire thing to stop, because i go back in time, solve the collision, and then in the next instance the collision is happening again.

My question is, how do i solve this problem of multiple boxes sitting on top of one another. 

I have looked at all of the articles on physics by http://www.wildbunny.co.uk and tried to understand his method but while i understand what he does, i have no clue how he does it. I also do not know any action script so much of his code is gibberish to me.

I have looked through several other guides on the internet but none of them seem to make sense to me.

Here is what would be of great help to me, if someone could tell me what sort of method is commonly used to implement the graphics of a game like angry-birds, specifically the multiple collisions method (is mine good enough or do i need to do speculative contacts like wildbunny talks about in his blog), and the box resting on box problem.
