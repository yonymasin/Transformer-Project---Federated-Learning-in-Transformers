Sorry for the length of this post, I hope it is as clear as I intended to be.

We are currently providing a B2B service that is essentially an application: a client access our administration panel to configure the application and makes it accessible to his users through a URL we provide.
Regarding our platform, it is standard PHP/MySQL with MVC Framework, but over the past few months, we have been pushing more application logic client-side, to a point server-side code mostly performs model validation and persistence.

We would like to move forward by being less of an application and more of a platform, where we could offer different applications for our clients to customise (changing configuration values), and extend from (using Javascript code) to match more precise needs.
Our main idea is to provide a rich REST/JSON API we would use ourselves to create our applications, secured with OAuth2 and running in a Cloud infrastructure (most likely to be Amazon AWS as we are already using S3).

Both our administration panel (accessed by our clients) and public applications (accessed by our clients’ users) would be able to run Javascript applications based on CommonJS. An application would be a CommonJS package set of an assembly of modules, all having access to an ‘API’ root module that would expose utility, CRUD and query methods to access our API server. Ideally, modules inside a package would be able to communicate between one-another so that each could focus on a single, quite simple, task and could therefore be useful in different packages simply by changing configuration values.

All permissions would be stored server-side so the servers would filter calls to only process authorised ones and return a response object or HTTP error codes accordingly.
The idea would be to use stateless (so easily scalable) EC2 instances running Node.js that would check the OAuth2 token (or provide one if needed), check the application permissions (query, CRUD operations) and retrieve the object either from the DB or from a cache shared by all instances.
Node.js seems a good choice for it because it is non-blocking and we would like to use WebSockets at some point, even though it is not our current priority.

Regarding data I/O, we would most likely have heavy write on certain entities (mainly users), medium write on entities related to applications (setting permissions, configuration, dependencies, Javascript code) and heavy read on them, but they would likely fit in a cache. 

The way I see it, we need relations (between applications and their dependencies, between our clients and their users...) but most of them would not change often and could be in the cache, so a document DB seems be a better fit than a relational one, as we would be dealing with Javascript, using JSON for data seems far more relevant.
Applications’ Javascript code would be minified, packed and stored on S3 to be accessible with a simple HTTP request.

User data stored by applications could be large sets of key-value pairs, but also binary data such as images. A document DB having Map/Reduce capacities seems a good fit for key-value pairs, but S3 a better one for binary data.

As for the cache, Amazon provides the Memcached-compliant ElastiCache but Redis seems more interesting regarding query capacities, and the Pub/Sub capacities could be very useful for communication between EC2 instances.

At some point, we would also like to provide data analysis and prediction, especially on the way our clients interact with their users. The document-graph DB OrientDB seems incredibly powerful and the ability to manage relationships as a graph very appealing, but I could not find lots of information about companies using it in production.
User data would mostly be stored in relation to a single application, so we would also need a way to quickly aggregate data from many applications and process it. We are currently reaching limits with MySQL as it is very slow to query the data we need, so some Map/Reduce or graph traversal could be very useful.

So here are my main questions:

 - Are these first considerations coherent with our needs, or should we
   stick with PHP/MySQL and build on it?
 - Is Amazon AWS a good choice for our needs or would other providers be more efficient and/or cost-effective?
 - Using AWS, should we prefer their own solutions (SimpleDB, ElastiCache, SNS...) over equivalent third-party ones (MongoDB, CouchDB, Redis...)?
 - Again with AWS, should we stick to MySQL using RDS, at least when we need relations, or prefer a document DB and handle relations in our code ?
 - Taking CommonJS as a standard for our platform development, would we be more effective and/or easier to develop for than rolling our own solution?
 - Is Node.js a valid choice for a fast API? Are there other technologies that would be a better fit for our needs?
 - Is OrientDB the unicorn of NoSQL databases, having all the capacities we could dream of without drawbacks or is it some kind of very promising but not ready yet technology?

I need to import a product catalog on a regular basis. It consist right now of one single file (a report with redundant data) but can be split inro 3-4 (clean, non-redundant) text or csv files with a total of aprox. 1500 rows (users, normal product, user specific products and discount prices for customers). Each row should end up in Umbraco as a new node, or an update to an existing node.

**Users** and **normal products** are just inserted under the same node (well, two nodes. One for users, one for products).
**Discounts** and **users specific products** should be inserted under the user node (created when importing the users)

For each import this should happen:
1) If item is not in Umbraco then create it
2) If item is present in Umbraco then update it
3) If item is in Umbraco but not in the file then hide it

Suggestion, when running import:
1) hide all items
2) run import/update and unhide affected elements at the same time
This can be done either on the report containing all data. Or on 3-4 files each holding a single type of data. I hope you can advise on what to do.

**Compentences needed:** Knowledge of Umbraco API and kind of an ""Umbraco expert"" or at least experienced with importing data into Umbraco
**Issue:** Normal use of Umbracos API will give a slooooow import lasting hours. Some clever solution that will speed up the import is needed. We need someone with that experience and knowledge.
**Deadline:** ASAP

Payment: If you can solve this problem, then just name your price. Is it to low I will doubble it. Is it to high I might choose someone else.

Let's say I have an SSO (single sign on) service and two separate web services that use it. Let's say that the SSO login happens via OAuth, just like Login with Facebook. (Correct me if I'm wrong that they're not just requesting an OAuth access token for the site in question.)

The question is then, how should the two web services expose their own APIs to third parties? Given that we've drunken the OAuth kool aid, it seems logical that the third parties should be considered OAuth consumers and they should request that the user approves an access token for them. Accepting that the question is, should the the web services handle all this OAuth stuff themselves, having the third parties register as OAuth consumers with them and only using the SSO to login the user? Or, should the web services hand all responsibility off to the SSO service? For signed requests, the web service would check the validity of the access token via the SSO's API and then process it as normal.

I see pluses and minuses to both approaches. On one hand, the first option places fewer demands on the SSO and each web service can handle the authorization for their APIs their own way. On the other hand, having the SSO handle things means that the third parties can get access tokens that are valid across all the services, just like how users can login across all of them. This can enable a better user interface, as otherwise the third party might have to keep asking the user for authorization as it needs to use different web services of the system, despite the separation between the different web services being invisible to the user. Of course, then either the SSO needs to have some sort of shared permission rules or each web service will still need to enforce its own rules. Also, the SSO would probably have to take some sort of text or HTML from the web services to display when asking the user to authorize the third party service.
