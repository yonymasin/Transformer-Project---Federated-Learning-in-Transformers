The docs then say you should access the following:

replacing `TOKEN_FROM_ABOVE` with the one returned by the previous request, and this should return “a list of all the Pages the user administers including Page specific access token for each Page”.

The docs then say you should access the following:

`https://graph.facebook.com/me/accounts?access_token=TOKEN_FROM_ABOVE`

replacing `TOKEN_FROM_ABOVE` with the one returned by the previous request, and this should return “a list of all the Pages the user administers including Page specific access token for each Page”.

However, it doesn't. All I get is the following JSON response:

    {
      ""error"": {
        ""message"": ""An unexpected error has occurred. Please retry your request later."",
        ""type"": ""OAuthException""
      }
    }

What am I doing wrong? Could I have set something up incorrectly when creating the application? The error message is less than helpful, so any assistance would be much appreciated.

The application works almost as intended, but there remains a major problem. This problem seems to be specific to the use of Fan Page albums. We have created a FB account that has 2 Fan Pages, each with 3 user albums. However, several of the albums have the flag can_upload set to false. 

So the first set of questions is how does this flag get set? And why would it be set to false for user albums? Can it be reset by the user or some other way?

In our 6 Fan Page albums (2 Fan Pages, 3 albums each) 1 album has the flag set ""correctly"", that is can_upload=true. For this album we can upload images and text as expected. 5 of the albums have can_upload set to false.

If the can_upload flag worked as expected, we could simply filter out the Fan Page albums that have it set to false. But if we do that, at least for our test FB account, we are throwing away perfectly good postable albums.

We have created a FB account that has 2 Fan Pages, each with 3 user albums. However, several of the albums have the flag can_upload set to false. 

So the first set of questions is how does this flag get set? And why would it be set to false for user albums? Can it be reset by the user or some other way?

In our 6 Fan Page albums (2 Fan Pages, 3 albums each) 1 album has the flag set ""correctly"", that is can_upload=true.

Don't get me wrong, I love using APIs and I understand the idealistic reasons for building services in such a way that they can grow to be bigger than what one person or company could build, but from a business perspective can anyone explain why you would want to give away your data and computation?",5

Does anyone know of a way to do this, or is this just not something you can do with the API.

My call object is as follows, and works fine when items are included:

",api,paypal,,,,07/03/2012 12:16:38,not a real question,1,14526,14,"PayPal SetExpressCheckout - ItemValue of 0 with shipping amount to pay - ERROR 10413 I'm trying to call SetExpressCheckout with a free item that requires shipping and I'm getting ""10413 - The totals of the cart item amounts do not match order amounts.""

Does anyone know of a way to do this, or is this just not something you can do with the API.

Yet, we don't have any database of places and we'd like to leverage a third-party api.
We'd like to start with a auto-complete search box like on Google Maps. For example, the user enters ""tamar"" and it suggests ""Tamarine Restaurant, Palo Alto, CA, United States"".
1) is it possible? what third party api would you use? Is Google maps the best?

Once the results are returned, the user selects one place and will leave a review.
2) how would you associate that review to that specific place in the DB? My concern is if later on we change api provider, that we can still associate our reviews to the new api places.

Thank you SO MUCH! Any suggestion would help.

The reason I came up with the question in the first place is, I'm currently working on a web application and if, hypothetically, I would stop working on this application and some other developer would take over, I figured he'd need some documentation for the functions that I wrote so he doesn't need to go through all the code, right?

I was wondering about ways to document my code and 'best practices' (if they exist for this subject). I know Ruby has RDoc which 'generates' documentation for the files in a specific directory. Does PHP have something like this? Or would it be better to not use some generator and write the documentation from scratch? If so, what would be the best way to do this?

Also, I was confused about the API acronym. Does this just mean all the functions in some application or is there more to it? When do we speak of an API and when do we speak of uh.. a bunch of functions? Or is an API more like.. something an external program can use to communicate with my application? 

I'm not even sure if something rather 'simple' like a web application needs documentation (even though I guess there are web apps that are rather complex..); I'm just a student wondering about things, I have next to none experience as far as 'real life' work/development goes.

Currently I only need to support payment in the USA, but may eventually be international. Here's the scenario:

I offer a service that allows an organization or manager-type person to coordinate contractors for very short term jobs. These jobs are typically only an hour or two in length. A contractor may get only one job over an entire month, several jobs spread out over a month, multiple jobs on a single day, or any other combination. Thus, a single contractor could earn as little as one job's payment up to potentially payment for dozens. Payment for a month could be as little as $10 up to $1000's.

Right now, the system provides payroll reports to the manager and it is the manager's responsibility to produce checks, stuff envelopes, and send mail via the US postal service. I'd like to remove this burden from the manager and have all the payments taken care of for them automatically by the system.

I'm not sure where to start or what the best options would be. I'm starting to look into the following solutions, but don't know specifics yet and would like some advice before pursuing them. I'd also like to hear about other ideas or suggestions.

 * PayPal (Send Money, Adaptive Payments, x.com, other???)
 * Amazon (Flexible Payments System?)
 * Fund some sort of pre-paid debit card?
 * Web service with API that mails checks for you?
 * Direct deposit via a bank API (for users with bank accounts)?

The problem is that many of these contractors may not be able to obtain bank accounts or credit cards within the USA. I don't mind doing a hybrid of solutions, but are there any that would work well with this issue? I want the solution to be easy to use for the contractors, meaning that they can get the money easily (via check in the mail, debit card ATM withdrawal, etc.)

Unfortunately, I found out, after being quite satisfied with my handy work, that v2 was outdated. I have tried to understand the v3 script so that I may convert what I currently have in v2, but I have not made much progress. The main problem I am having is that I can not grasp how to plot multiple points, 2 different icons, and with infowindows. (Also I could use some help in understanding how to apply to MarkerManager to plot these multiple points). Here is the code I am using right now (v2):

11091660,06/18/2012 21:54:31,786265,06/06/2011 16:52:08,35,0,API for a tree structure,"I have a web service that allows my users to manage music festivals. Each festival has a location, several stages and on each stage several artists.

So I have 4 entities : festival, location, stage and artist that can be represented as a tree structure. I need a simple CRUD for these.

In REST API terms, the obvious implementation would be to have 4 URIs (/festivals, /locations, /stages and /artists, potentially followed by a /id) that will be requested with POST, PUT, GET or DELETE.

But, for my needs, locations, stages and artists have no interests if they are not linked to a festival. So why would I need to implement CRUD methods for these entities ? A CRUD only for the festival entity shouldn't be enough ?

The drawbacks : 

- The clients of my API (website, native mobile apps, other services...) can't read a sub-entity of my festival. But, as I said before, sub-entities of my service have no interest without the festival they belong to. So each client will have to get the festival, the whole festival, and therefore every sub-entities.

- Those same clients will need to update the whole festival even if they just modified the name of an artist. This seems to be the worst drawback but, after all, is it that bad to send the full json of my festival (maximum a few kb) instead of a partial json that'll be a bit shorter ?

- I need to code, test and maintain 4 methods instead of 16 (and even more if there were more entities to manage, assuming they keep this simple tree structure).

What do you think of this approach?

Each festival has a location, several stages and on each stage several artists.

So I have 4 entities : festival, location, stage and artist that can be represented as a tree structure. I need a simple CRUD for these.

In REST API terms, the obvious implementation would be to have 4 URIs (/festivals, /locations, /stages and /artists, potentially followed by a /id) that will be requested with POST, PUT, GET or DELETE.

But, for my needs, locations, stages and artists have no interests if they are not linked to a festival. So why would I need to implement CRUD methods for these entities ? A CRUD only for the festival entity shouldn't be enough ?

The drawbacks : 

- The clients of my API (website, native mobile apps, other services...) can't read a sub-entity of my festival. But, as I said before, sub-entities of my service have no interest without the festival they belong to. So each client will have to get the festival, the whole festival, and therefore every sub-entities.

- Those same clients will need to update the whole festival even if they just modified the name of an artist. This seems to be the worst drawback but, after all, is it that bad to send the full json of my festival (maximum a few kb) instead of a partial json that'll be a bit shorter ?

They've had a Wordpress-blog, a Facebook group and a Shopify-store for a few years. They have a lot of people coming to their live events and lots of people in their different Facebook groups/pages/personas, and on their mailing list. Business in the online store however is pretty slow.

My grand vision for them is to have a web presence where all the parts are more tightly integrated. At least the end user should be able to put an item in the shopping cart by clicking a button on the blog. I've done stuff in Wordpress before and I'm not to crazy about it. My plan now is to use Django as a foundation instead.

From a developer perspective Shopify seems like a nice solution. But the client wants to ditch Shopify in favor of a Swedish provider called Textalk. The client feels that a Swedish e-commerce provider, that integrates nicely with Swedish payment gateways that their Swedish customers are familiar with, would increase sales. Textalk can give them that. The bad thing about Textalk is that it lacks an API, so it will be pretty hard to do custom integration between store and blog.

Now I'm looking for alternatives that will give the clients what they want (brand recognition among Swedish customers) and me what I want (low risk of lock in, easy to use API, active developer community, good documentation).

Unfortunately Shopify seems to be out of the game because they don't integrate with any of the big Swedish payment gateways.

Klarna is a Swedish payment gateway that seems to have a pretty large market share. At least a lot of the stores I shop in use them. They also have what looks like a solid API, and at least one other [SO user](http://stackoverflow.com/users/346012/marthin) has deemed it developer friendly. Maybe I shouldn't get to hung up on that since I don't plan to interact directly with Klarna anyway. But somehow I have a good feeling about them. And maybe at some point in the future I decide to interact directly with them from Django.

Klarna lists [a number of e-commerce solutions](http://integration.klarna.com/en/modules/step-by-step) that integrate with their API. 

* Demandware 

* Magneto (both community and enterprise editions)

* OpenCart

* osCommerce

* Oxid

* Prestashop

* Übercart

* VirtueMart

* WP E-commerce

* XT-commerce

* ZenCart


Since there are no Django products on that list I can't go for an all Django solution. What I'll probably want to do instead is set up one of the above products, or better still buy it as Saas, and hook into that from the Django blog. So now all I have to do is figure out which of the above products in turn have nice RESTful APIs and are provided as Saas. I know that Prestashop is sold as Saas by Swedish company Prestaworks, but I can't seem to find anything on Prestashops own API.

What about the others? Any other users out there (preferably Swedish) that can give me a low down on them? Or do I have to work my way down the list and research them all be myself?

Why they don't give is easy access to the fonts then if its all about giving and making a web better with this ""present""?
