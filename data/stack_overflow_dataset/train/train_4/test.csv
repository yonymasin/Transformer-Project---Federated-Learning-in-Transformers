What I ask (better to say beg) you to do for me is nothing more than giving me some exercises or an idea of a program/project that will include most of these things. I don't need the code (how to solve them), although some hints would be nice.

I'm hoping at least some of you will understand my situation and won't ignore my request.

Thank you in advance,

    For each argument type T in the function call, there is a set of zero or 
    more associated namespaces and aset of zero or more associated classes to
    be considered. The sets of namespaces and classes is determined entirely
    by the types of the function arguments (and the namespace of any template
    template argument).Typedef names and using-declarations used to specify 
    the types do not contribute to this set. The sets of namespaces and 
    classes are determined in the following way:
 
    — If T is a fundamental type, its associated sets of namespaces and 
      classes are both empty. ##1st point
    — If T is a class type (including unions), its associated classes are: 
      the class itself; the class of which it is a member, if any; and its 
      direct and indirect base classes. Its associated namespaces are the 
      namespaces of which its associated classes are members. Furthermore,
      if T is a class template specialization, its associated namespaces and
      classes also include: the namespaces and classes associated with the
      types of the template arguments provided for template type parameters
      (excluding template template parameters); the namespaces of which any
      template template arguments are members; and the classesof which any
      member templates used as template template arguments are members. 
      [ Note: Non-type template arguments do not contribute to the set of
      associated namespaces.—end note ]   ##2nd point
    — If T is an enumeration type, its associated namespace is the namespace
      in which it is defined. If it is class member, its associated class is
      the member’s class; else it has no associated class.   ##3rd point
    — If T is a pointer to U or an array of U, its associated namespaces and
      classes are those associated with U.    ##4th point
    — If T is a function type, its associated namespaces and classes are 
      those associated with the function parameter types and those associated 
      with the return type.        ##5th point 
    — If T is a pointer to a member function of a class X, its associated 
      namespaces and classes are those associated with the function parameter 
      types and return type, together with those associated with X.
    — If T is a pointer to a data member of class X, its associated namespaces
      and classes are those associated with the member type together with those
      associated with X.       ##6th point

    namespace is also included in the set. If an associated namespace directly
    contains inline namespaces, those inline namespaces are also included in
    the set. In addition, if the argument is the name or address of a set of

    and namespaces are the union of those associated with each of the members of
    the set, i.e., the classes and namespaces associated with its parameter

As a personal project, I've been developing a kernel in c++. Things are going well, in fact I have very good support for much of c++ available in kernel land (I've implemented nearly the entire libc and libstdc++).

One of the more difficult and compiler specific things is RTTI and exception support. For now I'm disabling exceptions entirely, but RTTI is something I want since things like `dynamic_cast` can be very useful. To make this work, I have a basic implementation of std::type_info which matches what g++ expects and then I link to g++'s `libsupc++.a` and `libgcc_eh.a`. This works great. RTTI works like a champ!

The question:

I've been toying with some optimization options and would like to someday have -mregparm as a compile time choice. Obviously this being a kernel and having to interact with assembly code, there are certain functions which don't play nice with not having the parameters on the stack. To solve this, I use the following macro:

    #define asmlinkage  attribute((regparm(0)))

Once again, this works very well. The problem is that when you do a `dynamic_cast`. The compile emits calls to some implicitly defined internal functions (defined in the support libraries previously mentioned) and does so respecting the -mregparm flag. Of course since I linked to the system's support libraries, they may or may not (they don't in my case) have a compatible calling convention...leading to a nice pretty kernel panic. Since these functions are implicit (no prototype in any of my files) and they have long, mangled names, it is (nearly) impossible to add my asmlinkage attribute to them.

There are 3 possible solutions which come to mind.

 1. forget about supporting
    -mregparm's all together.
 2. recompile those 2 support libs with
    the same flags as the kernel. This
    might be annoying and slightly
    impractical (I don't know if they
    can be cleanly isolated from the gcc
    build and toolchain upgrades could
    be very painful), but should work.
 3. **somehow make the compiler ignore
    -mregparm when calling code found in a particular .a/.o file.**

Of course since I linked to the system's support libraries, they may or may not (they don't in my case) have a compatible calling convention...leading to a nice pretty kernel panic. Since these functions are implicit (no prototype in any of my files) and they have long, mangled names, it is (nearly) impossible to add my asmlinkage attribute to them.

There are 3 possible solutions which come to mind.

 1. forget about supporting
    -mregparm's all together.
 2. recompile those 2 support libs with
    the same flags as the kernel. This
    might be annoying and slightly
    impractical (I don't know if they
    can be cleanly isolated from the gcc
    build and toolchain upgrades could
    be very painful), but should work.
 3. **somehow make the compiler ignore
    -mregparm when calling code found in a particular .a/.o file.**

Is option 3 possible? My gut feeling is no, but I figured that I would ask since there are a few g++ gurus on here :-).",4

For example: the interfacing application (which uses this library) can send socket management callback functions - send, receive, open, close etc., and the library will use this implementation in stead of the library's implementation.
(This way enables the application to manage the sockets by itself, can be useful).
This library has to expose also more callbacks, like, for example, a password validation, so I wonder if there is a preferred method to expose the callback sending option in one API.
Something like:

    int AddCallbackFunc (int functionCallbackType, <generic function prototype>, <generic way to pass some additional arguments>)

Then within my library I will assign the callback to the appropriate function pointer according to the functionCallbackType parameter.

Is there any way to implement it in a generic way which will fit ANY function prototype and ANY additional arguments?

Your help will be more than appreciated...

Some of the triangles in the primitive overlap, so when I add a material to the geometry with an alpha value I see the overlap (as expected). I want to get rid of this effect without changing the geometry though -- I tried playing around with different blending modes (glBlendFunc()) but I couldn't get this to work. I got some interesting results, but nothing that would eliminate opacity effects within the primitives of the tri strip, and preserve opacity for the entire object. I'm using OpenSceneGraph, but it provides a method to call glBlendFunc() for the geometry in question.

So from the image, assume that pink roads, purple roads and yellow roads constitute three separate objects, each created using a single tri strip (there are multiple strips, but for arguments sake, pretend that there were only three different colored tri strips here). I basically don't want to see the self intersections within the same color

Also, my question is pretty much the same as this one: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6972338/opengl-primitives-with-opacity-without-visible-overlap, but I should note that when I tried the blending mode in accepted answer for that question, the strips weren't rendered in the scene at all.

I am then combining them to be a single stream of bytes.  The problem I'm having is with my re-construction of the data to write out.

Basically I'm reading in 16 bytes and then building them into a single __m128i variable and then using _mm_stream_ps to write the value back out to memory.  However I have some odd performance results.

In my first scheme I use the _mm_set_epi8 intrinsic to set my __m128i as follows:

		const __m128i packedSamples	= _mm_set_epi8( sample15,	sample14,	sample13,	sample12,	sample11,	sample10,	sample9,	sample8,
													sample7,	sample6,	sample5,	sample4,	sample3,	sample2,	sample1,	sample0 );

Basically I leave it all up to the compiler to decide how to optimise it to give best performance.  This gives WORST performance.  MY test runs in ~0.195 seconds.

Second I tried to merge down by using 4 _mm_set_epi32 instructions and then packing them down:

        const __m128i samples0		= _mm_set_epi32( sample3, sample2, sample1, sample0 );
		const __m128i samples1		= _mm_set_epi32( sample7, sample6, sample5, sample4 );
		const __m128i samples2		= _mm_set_epi32( sample11, sample10, sample9, sample8 );
		const __m128i samples3		= _mm_set_epi32( sample15, sample14, sample13, sample12 );

		const __m128i packedSamples0	= _mm_packs_epi32( samples0, samples1 );
		const __m128i packedSamples1	= _mm_packs_epi32( samples2, samples3 );
		const __m128i packedSamples		= _mm_packus_epi16( packedSamples0, packedSamples1 );

This does improve performance somewhat.  My test now runs in ~0.15 seconds.  Seems counter-intuitive that performance would improve by doing this as I assume this is exactly what _mm_set_epi8 is doing anyway ...

My final attempt was to use a bit of code I have from making four CCs the old fashioned way (with shifts and ors) and then putting them in an __m128i using a single _mm_set_epi32.

		const GCui32 samples0		= MakeFourCC( sample0, sample1, sample2, sample3 );
		const GCui32 samples1		= MakeFourCC( sample4, sample5, sample6, sample7 );
		const GCui32 samples2		= MakeFourCC( sample8, sample9, sample10, sample11 );
		const GCui32 samples3		= MakeFourCC( sample12, sample13, sample14, sample15 );
		const __m128i packedSamples	= _mm_set_epi32( samples3, samples2, samples1, samples0 );

This gives even BETTER performance.  Taking ~0.135 seconds to run my test.  I'm really starting to get confused.

So I tried a simple read byte write byte system and that is ever-so-slightly faster than even the last method.  

So what is going on?  This all seems counter-intuitive to me.

I've considered the idea that the delays are occuring on the _mm_stream_ps because I'm supplying data too quickly but then I would to get exactly the same results out whatever I do.  Is it possible that the first 2 methods mean that the 16 loads can't get distributed through the loop to hide latency?  If so why is this?  Surely an intrinsic allows the compiler to make optimisations as and where it pleases .. i thought that was the whole point ... Also surely performing 16 reads and 16 writes will be much slower than 16 reads and 1 write with a bunch of SSE juggling instructions ... After all its the reads and writes that are the slow bit!

I am using codeblocks as IDE, does anyone have any idea what and how to include files? 
I'm thinking maybe there is something that i am not doing correctly. 

Can somebody please help? Thank you very much for your suggestions.

It said that, ostringstream's operator<< isn't a re-enterable function. is that right?

Could you please verify if you can compile it?

How can I fix it please? 
I'm using Visual Studio 2010 and SDL 1.2.15. I didn't modify the original code.
Could you please verify if you can compile it?
Thanks in advance!

And i missed my professor's office hours, because I had another exam during that time. Any help will be greatly appreciated! 

here's the question: 
8.Suppose that we have a treeNode class with data members like this:

>class treeNode {
int data;
treeNode* left;
treeNode* right;
treeNode* parent;
};

Where parent is a pointer to the (unique) node that has this node as a child, or a null
pointer if this node is the root. Write (or at least sketch) an algorithm that finds and
returns the node in the tree with the next largest value. For example, in the attached
illustration if this function is called for the node containing 28, it would return the root
(31). Hint: do not use recursion.

I'm in the process of designing and building a fairly large music application, using the C++ Juce framework, that in a nutshell takes in OSC messages and turns them into audio and MIDI data. The application has three 'modes', each defining what kind of sound will be produced by the OSC messages. The user can apply a mode and a further bunch of mode settings to define the sound that each OSC message 'triggers'. 

Below is a basic block diagram overview of the programs' class relationship and hierarchy, or at least how I theoretically imagine it to be. To clarify the Juce terminology, a 'Component' class is basically a GUI object/class that displays things on screen and allows user interaction.

![Basic block diagram](http://liamlacey.web44.net/images/Software_block_diagram.jpg)

I'm an experienced C programmer, however I'm fairly new to C++ and OOP design. I'm understanding most if it fine but the major problem I'm having is in terms of  structuring all the classes to have the correct relationships and hierarchy so that they can all communicate properly in order for the application to do what it needs to do.

Here is a brief description of what each class does:
	<br>•	OscInput - this base class uses the oscpack library to listen for OSC messages. Only 1 class can inherit from this base class as the application will crash if there are multiple listeners on the same UDP port.
	<br>•	Main - application start-up. Inherits from OscInput so that every time an OSC message is received a callback function is called within this class
	<br>•	MainWindow - the apps main document window - default to Juce apps.
	<br>•	MainComponent - the main/background component/GUI of the app - default to Juce apps.
	<br>•	Mode1Component/Mode2Component/Mode3Component - a single instance of each of these component classes is called and displayed from MainComponent which are used by the user to change the settings of what each OSC message does.
	<br>•	SubComponent1 - a single instance of this component class is called and displayed from MainComponent.
	<br>•	SubComponent2 - 48 instances of this component class are called and displayed from SubComponent1. Each instance is used to display the value of a different OSC message being received.
	<br>•	Mode1/Mode2/Mode3  - a single instance of each of these classes is called from Main. Each class is used to actually convert the OSC messages into audio or MIDI data, based on values/variables within the Settings class.
	<br>•	Settings - a single instance of this class that is used to store settings that control what sound is produced from each different OSC message.

I'm fairly happy I have all the component/GUI classes laid out and connected in the right way. I have also got incoming OSC messages working fine. But it is the relationship of the Settings class instance that I'm not quite sure how to implement. Here are the relationships I need help with:
	<br>•	The single instances of Mode1, Mode2, and Mode3 all need to retrieve values from the Setting class instance
	<br>•	The single instances of MainComponent, Mode1Component, Mode2Component, Mode3Component all need to send values to the Settings class instance, as well as retrieve values from the instance.
	<br>•	All 48 instances of SubComponent2 need to retrieve OSC messages

<b>Therefore I have the following quieries:</b>
	<br>•	Where should the Settings class instance be called from so that all the relevant class instances mentioned above can communicate with it? I only want a single instance of this class that needs to be accessed by many other classes, so should it be a global, Singleton, or static class? I've been studying the Singleton design pattern which seems to be what I'm looking for, but I get the impression I should avoid it if I can and consider alternative methods.
	<br>•	Should it be the Main class  that listens for OSC messages? How can I get SubComponent2 to receive OSC messages as well as the Mode1, Mode2, and Mode3 class instances?
	<br>•	Should the functionality classes (Mode1, Mode2, and Mode3) be called from Main? I'm trying to keep all functionality and GUI code separate as I have someone else dealing with GUI programming while I'm dealing with the functionality programming of the application.
	<br>•	Can anyone spot any major flaws in the design pattern of my program?

The derived class use the base class `insert` method to insert elements to the `unordered_map<int,int>` container,

The first `int` uses like counter and start with 0. The first ten insert elements going O.K. but in the 11th element I get sigsegv,and fault in `struct equal_to` at stl_function.h(209).

Okay, so after version 0.60 of [GTK+](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GTK%2B#History), the designers realized that for future development and progress, the entire toolkit needed to be rewritten to be object-oriented. 

Now, since C doesn't support OOP, to provide object-orientation and in inheritance heiriearchies, they created the [GObject System](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GObject). Now creating the GObject System must have required development time, more dependencies, more problems, but they had to create it to provide object orientation capabilities to the **C** Programming Language. But at that time, there was another solution that provided _exactly_ that, **C++**! 

## The Question ##

Why didn't the developers of GTK+ just use C++?

I mean, Why waste time creating an entire library instead of using a time-tested solution adopted by a lot of projects?

More precisely, the following member functions are mainly used: init, copy, set, and destroy.
 
- The `init` member function is used to initialize all the private members. It's mostly called inside the `constructors`, e.g. the `default` or `parameter constructor`.  
- The `copy` member function is used to do a `deep copy` of an object passed as a `const reference`. It is called inside the `reference constructor` and the overload of the `operator =`.  
- The `set`  member function which mainly `allocates` memory for the `private members` that require it.  
- Finally, the `destroy` member function is used for `releasing` the allocated memory. It's called, for example, inside of the `destructor`.

I would like to have your opinion and know if this is a good programming practice? Which are the benefits or drawbacks? Any comments and suggestions are welcomed!
Below, I'm illustrating how those member functions are defined for a `CMatrix<T>` class.

I'm having issues when panning the drawing. What I would like to do is to create a bitmap that's 3x as wide as the drawing window & 3x as high. Then, when the user begins to pan, I would render the part of the bitmap that should be visible.

Trouble is, it doesn't appear as though you can have bitmaps bigger than your render target. Here's approximately what I've done so far:

    // Get the size of my drawing window.
    RECT rect;
    HDC hdc = GetDC(hwnd);
    GetClipBox(hdc, &rect);

    D2D1_SIZE_U size = D2D1::SizeU(
        rect.right - rect.left,
        rect.bottom - rect.top
    );

    // Now create the render target
    ID2D1HwndRenderTarget *hwndRT = NULL;

    hr = m_pD2DFactory->CreateHwndRenderTarget(
        D2D1::RenderTargetProperties(),

        );

    // And then the bitmap render target
    ID2D1BitmapRenderTarget *bmpRT = NULL;
    // We want it 3x as wide & 3x as high as the window
    D2D1_SIZE_F size = D2D1::SizeF(
        (rect.right - rect.left) * 3, 
        (rect.bottom - rect.top) * 3
    );
    hr = originalTarget->CreateCompatibleRenderTarget(
            size,
            &bmpRT
            );

    // Now I draw the geometry to my bitmap Render target...

    // Then get the bitmap
    ID2D1Bitmap* bmp = NULL;
    bmpRT->GetBitmap(&bmp);

    // From here I want to draw that bitmap on my hwndRenderTarget.
    // Based on where my mouse was when I started panning, and where it is
    // now, I can create a destination rectangle. It's the size of my
    // drawing window

        1.0,
        D2D1_BITMAP_INTERPOLATION_MODE_LINEAR,
        dest
        );

So when I check the size of my bitmap, it checks out OK - it's the size of my bitmap render target, not my hwnd render target. But if I set x1 & y1 to 0, it should draw the top left-hand corner of the bitmap (which is some geometry off the screen). But it just draws the top left-corner of what **is** on the screen.

Does anyone have any experience with this? How can I create a fairly large bitmap, and then render a portion of it on a smaller-sized render target? Since I'm panning, the render will take place on every mouse-move, so it has to be reasonably performant.",c++,direct2d,,,,10/20/2011 04:32:07,too localized,1,570,7,"Rendering part of a bitmap using Direct2D I'm in the process of converting a custom CAD software from GDI to Direct2D.

I think I am having trouble with binary file io.  If I run my program, create some employee objects and then display them everything works fine.  If I save the object data and reload the program I get an RTTI exception. It apears to me that my LoadEmployeeData() and Savelist(vector<Employee*> &e) functions work just fine. The exception occurs in my DisplayEmployeeData() function when I try to use typeid.

Just to reiterate, I am getting an RTTI error when using typeid on an object loaded from disk.

",c++,file-io,binary,rtti,,,open,0,2252,9,"c++ trouble with either RTTI or binary file io 
I think I am having trouble with binary file io.  If I run my program, create some employee objects and then display them everything works fine.  If I save the object data and reload the program I get an RTTI exception. It apears to me that my LoadEmployeeData() and Savelist(vector<Employee*> &e) functions work just fine. The exception occurs in my DisplayEmployeeData() function when I try to use typeid.

Just to reiterate, I am getting an RTTI error when using typeid on an object loaded from disk.

Is this okay or should we always stick to singular names for variables? As one example a collection of cars could be called 'cars' or 'car'

Consider another example:

        vector< string > students; // it is named as students rather singular student

        students.push_back(""Mark"");
        students.push_back(""Steve"");

         // a little clumsy

        string current_student = students[0]; 
Alternatively we can define the container object as singular like below but does it look like to represent a single object now instead of collection of students? It does make using index look better though.

        vector< string > student;
Another option that I personally like is something like this:

       vector< string > student_list;
I append '_list' (or could be camel notation) to the collection variable name (irrespective if its vector or list or map). This way name of the object is singular yet it identifies itself as collection of objects.

Which is a better way or convention and more readable of the above? Should plural names be absolutely avoided?

Also think of another simpler example as well, say we are conducting an experiment where we record temperatures of a day 100 times at different intervals so we :

         float temperatures[100]; // or temperature[100]? or temperature_list[100]?

For example, for test-source-code:

 1. Locate `MyTest.cpp` in within the directory with
    the ""real"" source code (don't like this)

 2. Locate `MyTest.cpp` in a `./test/.` subdirectory for the library/project

 3. Locate `MyTest.cpp` in a `./test/.` peer directory for the library/project dir

 4. Locate `MyTest.cpp` in a centralized `./test/.` ""well-known-test-directory"" shared by many libraries/projects (such as a ""well-known-test-dir-in-a-workspace"")

Issues I see:

 - would be nice to version ""test-source-code"" with ""real-source-code"" (e.g., within ""library-level"")

 - would be nice to handle functional/cross-library tests (outside the scope of a single library)

 - would be nice to deal with ""test-data"" in addition to ""test-logic""

 - *(should not need to be said)*, system must be able to scale to very large numbers of tests

I'm leaning towards (2) for unit tests and (4) for functional tests.  **Should unit tests be in a `./test/.` subdirectory?  Should functional tests be in a ""well-known"" `test` directory for the ""build-workspace"" (outside any given library directory?)**

I've tried hunting the bug down myself but I really can't find what's wrong. I know what a segfault means but this one really has me stumped. I'm a beginner may I add but am quickly learning.

I've got a basic main class `void Engine` that has a method `void RenderFrame` that renders every frame of the application. Inside said method I have this code which is supposed to draw all the tiles onto the renderwindow:


	Tile* tile;    
	for (short y = 0; y < mapHeight; ++y) {
		for (short x = 0; x < mapWidth; ++x) {
			tile	= currentLevel -> GetTile(x, y);

			if (tile) {
				tile -> Draw((x * tileSize), (y * tileSize), Wnd);
			}
		}
	}

The GetTile method is supposed to return a tile from within a `std::vector<std::vector<Tile *> >`

The Draw method only does this:

	void Tile::Draw(int x, int y, sf::RenderWindow *pWnd) {
		sprite.SetPosition(x, y);
		pWnd -> Draw(sprite);
	}
The application compiles just fine, but it crashes right after calling `sprite.SetPosition(x, y);`

I implemented the algorithm basically following reynolds' boids-model. That means, one Boid (as in ""one fish in a swarm"") moves according to it's neighbours in a certain radius. AS things are, the basic complexity of that is O(n²), as every boid has to check all it's flockmates if they are in range and then considers some factors to calculate the own movement.

The algorithm itself is implemented and runs smoothly. It accepts models of all different sizes, it works in 2D and 3D space, it flocks nice etc, I'm working on it for a while already.

My Problem is that the algorithm crashes on runtime as soon as I hit a kind of ""barrier"" in boid numbers, which is roughly 200-250 and even varies. Now, if it would get slower and slower until I'm broken to 1 fps I could understand that simply performance of the algorithm is the problem.

As you can see, I'm using a vector of pointers to boid objects in swarm. On runtime, swarm::move() is called, which iterates through the vector and calls boid::move() for every boid.

    bool swarm::move(float timeSinceLastFrame) {
        std::vector<boid*>::iterator iter;
        for ( iter = flock.begin(); iter != flock.end(); iter++ ) {
            (*iter)->move(timeSinceLastFrame);
        }
        return true;
    }

boid::move is very complex as it calculates the movement based on a lot of things. I will post the points that - imo - actually matter for here, not every single multiplication, as I don't want to bore you with unneeded stuff.

    bool boid::move(float timeSinceLastFrame) {
        
        /* do some stuff */
        std::vector<boid*>::iterator iter;
        std::vector<boid*> temp = flockMates->getFlockMates();

        for ( iter = temp.begin(); iter != temp.end(); iter++ ) {
            if ( (*iter) != this ) {
                /* run through all the boids, check for distances, calculate your own velocity */
            }
        }

        /* do some more stuff */

        /* actually move the boid */
        return true;
    };

So, as you can see, the basic algorithm **is** quite heavy, agreeably. I run  through a vector of boids, call a method of each boid which then again runs through the vector. The other calculations are basic, just throwing variables around so that everything looks good, nothing that exponentially increases the complexity.

Now, as already stated, I would expect the rendering to go slow at a high amount of boids. I would expect framerates to drop and so on, but that simply doesnt happen. Instead the algorithm runs perfectly fine with high and fluid framerates until I'm roughly at 200 boids +/-, then crashes instantly as soon as swarm::move() is called.

I already checked several loose ends. The vector container has enough room for >1 billion elements, so its not that. I can also initialise everything with 10000, 20000 boids, so it's not a basic memory allocation problem either. It just crashes as soon as swarm::move() is called.

So, why does this crash with a number of 200 and a few boids? Why doesn't the Framerate drop over time instead? Thanks for any help on this.

annoying problem. 
Let's consider the following basic mixin layer: 

    template <typename Next> 
    struct Layer1 : public Next 
    { 
     struct A : public Next::A 
     { 
       void f() { g(); } 
       void g() {} 
     }; 
    };
 

Nothing fancy here, just a simple mixin with 2 methods `f()` and `g()`. 
Notice that the `g()` call from `f()` is is statically binded to this 
specific `Layer1::A::g()`. 
Now, what I want is to be able to completely hook the methods of this 
mixin to implement, say, a logging layer: 

    template <typename Next> 
    struct Layer2 : public Next 
    { 
     struct A : public Next::A 
     { 
       void f() 
       { 
         std::cout << ""Layer2::A::f() [enter]"" << std::endl; 
         Next::A::f(); 
         std::cout << ""Layer2::A::f() [leave]"" << std::endl; 
       } 
       void g() 
       { 
         std::cout << ""Layer2::A::g() [enter]"" << std::endl; 
         Next::A::g(); 
         std::cout << ""Layer2::A::g() [leave]"" << std::endl; 
       } 
     }; 
    };


Considering `Layer2<Layer1<...>>`, the problem here is that any call of 
`f()` and `g()` from a layer above `Layer2` will properly cascade down to 
the `Layer2::A::g()`, and thus display the proper logging messages. But 
any call of `f()` and `g()` from below `Layer2` will not log anything since 
the call would have been statically binded to the `g()` available at the 
time the call was made. 
This means that calling `f()` from any layer above `Layer2` will obviously 
still always call `Layer1::A::g()` from `Layer1::A::f()` and not display 
the logging messages. 
I came up with 2 solutions to this problem:
 
 1. Virtuality: clearly not acceptable. The whole point of mixin layers 
is to avoid virtuality when not necessary. 

 2. Adding a template parameter to the layers to provide the previous 
layer, something of the kind. 

.

    template <typename Next, template <typename> class Prev> 
    struct Layer2 : public Next 
    { 
     typedef Next next_t;

       { 
         std::cout << ""Layer2::A::f() [enter]"" << std::endl; 
         Next::A::f(); 
         std::cout << ""Layer2::A::f() [leave]"" << std::endl; 
       } 
       void g() 
       { 
         std::cout << ""Layer2::A::g() [enter]"" << std::endl; 
         Next::A::g(); 
         std::cout << ""Layer2::A::g() [leave]"" << std::endl; 
       } 
     }; 
    }; 
    
    template <typename Next, template <typename> class Prev> 
    struct Layer1 : public Next 
    { 
     typedef Next next_t; 
     struct A : public Next::A 
     { 
       void f() 
       { 
         std::cout << ""Layer1::A::f() [enter]"" << std::endl; 
         ((typename Prev<Layer1<Next,Prev> >::A*)this)->g(); 
         std::cout << ""Layer1::A::f() [leave]"" << std::endl; 
       } 
       void g() 
       { 
         std::cout << ""Layer1::A::g() [enter]"" << std::endl;

       } 
     }; 
    }; 

    typedef Layer2<Layer1<Layer0,Layer2>,NullType> Application;

 
Well, it works, but I would like to hide this second template 
parameter since it is redundant.

solutions did you developped to solve it, since there is a clear lack 
of articles on mixin layers. ",c++,layer,mixin,,,,open,0,884,5,"Mixin layers & static binding I'm currently playing with mixin layers designs, and I'm stuck with an

 2. Adding a template parameter to the layers to provide the previous 
layer, something of the kind.

Well, it works, but I would like to hide this second template 
parameter since it is redundant.

solutions did you developped to solve it, since there is a clear lack 
of articles on mixin layers. ",3

The `resource` class has private constructors, and instances can only be created by a friend class `resource_manager`. Clients obtain handles to `resource`s through methods of the `resource_manager` and are unable to modify the `resource`s, although in the future I may need modifiable `resource`s as well.

So far I thought of two methods of referencing the `resource`s:

1. By a numeric ID. This has the advantage that can be directly mapped to the vector index (`resource_manager` uses `std::vector` internally), although I realise conceptually I shouldn't be considering this because the implementation of `resource_manage` may change. A disadvantage is that clients cannot call const methods of the `resource` object directly.

2. By `const resource*`. This has the advantage of clients being able to call `const` methods directly. I am generally trying to not use basic pointers in my program, but I think pointers to const are a good exception from using `shared_ptr`, because the clients are unable to delete the `resource` objects.

Now, what has been observed is that when the worker thread catches any exception(raised from a lower layer), this thread is continued, and immediately cores with exit code 134, which is SIGABRT.

The stacktrace is as follows-

So it seems that this run() function which specifies that it will not throw any exceptions using ""throw()"" spec, raises an exception(from Frame 4). As per various references about __cxa_call_unexpected(), the stacktrace depicts the typical behaviour of compiler to abort when exception is raised in a function with ""throw()"" spec.
Am I right with the analysis of the problem?

To test, I added a try catch in this method, and printed the exception message. Now the process didn't core. The exception message was same as the one caught by worker thread. 
My question is, how does this thread get access to the exception caught by the other? Do they share some datastructure related to exception handling?

Please throw some light on this. It is quite puzzling..

Note:- As per stacktrace, the call_unexpected is raised immediately after run() is called. That strengthens my doubt that somehow exception stack or data is shared. But didn't find any references to this behaviour.

However, it's a bit tricky because `n` is very large (1 <= n <= 10^9). The answer then modulo 1000000007. The sequence is defined as follows:  
![enter image description here][1]


Using generating function, I obtain the following formula:
![enter image description here][2]


  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/IoyJx.png
  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/co9PI.png

If I use the sequence approach then the answer can be modulo, but it run extremely slow. In fact, I got `time limit exceed` many times. I also tried to use a table to by pre-generate some initial values, still it was not fast enough. In addition, the maximum number of elements that I can store into an array (C++) is way less than 10^9, so I guess this approach won't work.  
If I use the direct formula then it run extremely fast but only for `n` that is small. For `n` large, double will got truncated, plus I won't be able to mod my answer with that number because modulo only works with integer.  
I ran out of idea, and I think there must be a very nice trick to work around this problem, unfortunately I just can't think of one. Any idea would be greatly appreciated.  

Here's my initial approach:

",c++,algorithm,optimization,numbers,programming-contest,,open,0,608,6,"How to speed up series generation? The problem requires to generate the `n-th` element of a sequence that is similar to Fibonacci sequence. However, it's a bit tricky because `n` is very large (1 <= n <= 10^9). The answer then modulo 1000000007. The sequence is defined as follows:  
![enter image description here][1]


Using generating function, I obtain the following formula:
![enter image description here][2]


  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/IoyJx.png
  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/co9PI.png

If I use the sequence approach then the answer can be modulo, but it run extremely slow. In fact, I got `time limit exceed` many times. I also tried to use a table to by pre-generate some initial values, still it was not fast enough. In addition, the maximum number of elements that I can store into an array (C++) is way less than 10^9, so I guess this approach won't work.  
If I use the direct formula then it run extremely fast but only for `n` that is small. For `n` large, double will got truncated, plus I won't be able to mod my answer with that number because modulo only works with integer.  
I ran out of idea, and I think there must be a very nice trick to work around this problem, unfortunately I just can't think of one. Any idea would be greatly appreciated.

Do you have any other recommendation how I can teach the student?

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/115703/storing-c-template-function-definitions-in-a-cpp-file

it is easy to seprate the interface and the implementation of a template class,

    } 

    //destructor

    template <typename T> 
    void foo::do(const T& t) 
    { 
        // Do something with t 
    } 

    template void foo::do<int>(const int&); 
    template void foo::do<std::string>(const std::string&); 

the trick being to specialise the template class by creating instances at the end of the .cpp file.

But what if this was a pure virtual template class 

**.h file**

    template<typename T> 
    class foo 
    { 
       public:
         foo();
         ~foo(); 
         virtual void do(const T& t) = 0; 
    }; 

and we derive a concrete class from this:

    template<typename T> 
    class foobar : public foo<T>
    { 
       public: 
         void do(const T& t); 
    }; 

the source file for this class looks like

**.cpp file**

    template <typename T> 
    void foobar::do(const T& t) 
    { 
        // Do something with t 
    } 

    template void foobar::do<int>(const int&); 
    template void foobar::do<std::string>(const std::string&); 

and the source file for foo looks the same except the initiations are removed (since ofcourse now foo is an abstract class).

But there's a linker error now; `foo<int>()` is unresolved in the constructor of `foobar<int>`. This is fixed by moving the constructor and destructor of foo back to the header file from the source file.

    void foo::do(const T& t) 
    { 
        // Do something with t 
    } 

    template void foo::do<int>(const int&); 
    template void foo::do<std::string>(const std::string&); 

the trick being to specialise the template class by creating instances at the end of the .cpp file.

But what if this was a pure virtual template class 

**.h file**

    template<typename T> 
    class foo 
    { 
       public:
         foo();
         ~foo(); 
         virtual void do(const T& t) = 0; 
    }; 

and we derive a concrete class from this:

    template<typename T> 
    class foobar : public foo<T>
    { 
       public: 
         void do(const T& t); 
    }; 

the source file for this class looks like

**.cpp file**

    template <typename T> 
    void foobar::do(const T& t) 
    { 
        // Do something with t 
    } 

    template void foobar::do<int>(const int&); 
    template void foobar::do<std::string>(const std::string&); 

and the source file for foo looks the same except the initiations are removed (since ofcourse now foo is an abstract class).

But there's a linker error now; `foo<int>()` is unresolved in the constructor of `foobar<int>`. This is fixed by moving the constructor and destructor of foo back to the header file from the source file. 

So my question is how can we create abstract template base classes and keep the deifnition of the template class hidden in a source file??",3

I also tried to specify the absolute path of the library, but it doesn't work either:

I'm just looking for a bit of help here. Here's the prompt:

For research purposes the admissions officers of your local university wants to know how well female and male students perform in certain courses. The user enters the number of courses to be considered. The student's data for each course is provided as a GPA followed by a letter code representing the gender of the student in this format: each line of input consists of a real number representing the student's GPA followed by the letter code f (for female students); m (for male students).
The number of entries (students) for each course is not known and the number 0.0 followed by the letter O indicates the end of data for specific course.

That being said, this is an introduction to c++ and as such; arrays, strings, and anything else outside of int, floats, doubles, and char is basically not allowed. In the code there needs to be the ability to type in various entries in any order (male entry followed by female and as well as the opposite.)
 
the issue i'm having is this, at the end of the program it is required to give an output of ""General School Averages"" which are sorted by female and male.  I understand how to get the total in which to divide the problem, i just can't seem to get the sum.  Anytime I try to get the sum, the value for the first course (first time through loop) is not kept so I can't figure out for the life of me how to do it.

I messed up the former test case I tried to publish here, I'm sorry about that. I guess I don't quite understand what happens there. I assume Cbeckhoff_frontendDlg starts the parential CDialogEx- constructor, but I want to start my own constructor test aswell. Is that possible?

    #define CRTDBG_MAP_ALLOC  
    #include <stdlib.h>  
    #include <crtdbg.h>
    
    _CrtDumpMemoryLeaks();

which gives me this result and also i can't catch where is the reason of this leak:

Sorry, i know that this issue is very boring but realy i need your help.
",c++,memory-management,memory-leaks,,,05/19/2012 14:57:18,too localized,1,6274,9,"how can i fix this memory Leak in C++? I'm having a Memory leak in my C++ 6.0 application, and i can't fix it leak although i'm using ""LeakDiag"" and ""LDGragher"" to detect memory leak but i can't found the reason of this leak, also i had dumped memory by using this code:

    #define CRTDBG_MAP_ALLOC  
    #include <stdlib.h>  
    #include <crtdbg.h>
    
    _CrtDumpMemoryLeaks();

which gives me this result and also i can't catch where is the reason of this leak:

    Detected memory leaks!

Thank you for your time.",c++,class,variables,inheritance,between,,open,0,554,9,"Using inheritance to pass a non-static variable between classes I'm researching UI's as a portfolio project and I ran into a little bit of trouble when it comes to inheritance. The problem I'm facing is this: I have two classes, R_GUI, in which I draw the form, and Button, where I draw the buttons. I want the Buttons to be positioned inside the FORM. I store the FORM position as form_x, and form_y. Here are my two classes:

and the Button class:

    class Button: public R_GUI
    {

    	int b_form_x, b_form_y;
    	int b_handle_y;

I began doing some cleanup of the shader, because it was full of experimental stuff, and I had the following line at the end of the fragment shader:

    gl_FragColor = final_color * (texture2D(tex, gl_TexCoord[0].st)*1.0 + texture2D(tex2, gl_TexCoord[0].st)*1.0);

I attempted to clean it up and I had the following declared at the top:

    uniform sampler2D tex, tex2;

Changing these lines to:

    gl_FragColor = final_color * texture2D(tex, gl_TexCoord[0].st;
and

    uniform sampler2D tex;

actually broke the program (black screen), even though I am doing

    GLuint tex_loc = glGetUniformLocation(shader_prog_id_, ""tex"");
    glUniform1i(tex_loc, texture_id_);

in my main code. I'm sure it's a texture issue and not a glsl compiler error, because I can add `1.0` to the output and end up with a white silhouette of my mesh.

The strangeness begins when I change the lines in my shader to:

    gl_FragColor = final_color * texture2D(tex2, gl_TexCoord[0].st;
and

    uniform sampler2D tex2;

but still retrieve the location for `tex`. The program works as it always has, even though inspecting the value of `tex_loc` in the debugger indicates an error. I'm not happy doing this, and now that I'm trying to load multiple textures, it will cause bigger headaches down the line.

I'm using VBOs, in interleaved format, to render the geometry. I'm passing in the vertex position, normal and texcoord this way.

http://forums.cgsociety.org/showthread.php?f=89&t=1010489

Didn't you find it quite annoying when you worked on a large .cpp, which used heavy template functions, that when you change one character in a function, you would have to wait sometimes a whole minute for the compilation of the whole file? Well some of you might have moved some parts of the large .cpp to new files, but I was considering a more automated process.

So I was wondering if there is a makefile and a compiler that supports building a .cpp at function level. It means that if you would change one function, only that function would be recompiled, instead of the whole file. If there isn't such a thing, here is a basic idea for a python script:

Preliminaries:

There would be a directory for each file*.cpp, which would contain the last copy of the .cpp from the last build (we will call it the old copy), and func*.cpp files for each function in file.cpp.

Now for the build process:

1. If the file.cpp is newer than its old copy (compare by file date), then it needs rebuilding.
2. Diff between the old and new file.cpp, and locate conclusively the changed functions. If something changed besides functions, recreate the whole file.cpp directory.
3. For each changed function create a new func.cpp, which would contain all the headers, and the prototypes of all the functions that came before it in file.cpp.
4. Run the regular build process for all func*.cpp files.

Some details:

1. The would also be a file that would hold all the global variables, and each func*.cpp would have besides previous functions prototypes, extern declaration for previous global variables.
2. Note that debugging would be made naturally on the func*.cpp files.
3. The connection between a function symbol and its .cpp can be made through a symbol db file.

Comments:

1. It would be a smart compilation step using any current compiler tools that would fit smoothly into the build pipe line.
2. Think about the implications. It would be like every function would have a separate .cpp file. Can you imagine the boost in the average compilation time?
3. For those of you who delegate the compilation process to the link time (Visual studio optimization section /gl /ltcg), be sure to note that you wait much longer, and it doesn't have much effect, at least for a daily working with the code. So I personally disable these.

For example, `shared_ptr` defines `operator<` be equivalent to:

    {
        return std::less<void*>()(a.get(), b.get());

Using `std::less` provides total ordering with respect to pointer values, unlike a vanilla relational pointer comparison, which is unspecified.

I can understand the rationale behind either choice:

 - with respect to method: it represents a pointer so just use the built-in pointer operators, versus it needs to be usable within an associative container so provide total ordering (like a vanilla pointer would get with the default `std::less` predicate template argument)
 - with respect to completeness: it represents a pointer so provide all the same comparisons as a pointer, versus it is a class type and only needs to be less-than comparable to be used in an associative container, so only provide that requirement

However, `unique_ptr` defines the same operator as:

    template <typename T1, typename D1, typename T2, typename D2>
    bool operator<(const unique_ptr<T1, D1>& a, const unique_ptr<T2, D2>& b)
    {
        return a.get() < b.get();
    }

It also defined the other relational operators in similar fashion.

---

Why the change in method and ""completeness""? That is, why does `shared_ptr` use `std::less` while `unique_ptr` uses the built-in `operator<`? And why doesn't `shared_ptr` also provide the other relational operators, like `unique_ptr`?

I can understand the rationale behind either choice:

 - with respect to method: it represents a pointer so just use the built-in pointer operators, versus it needs to be usable within an associative container so provide total ordering (like a vanilla pointer would get with the default `std::less` predicate template argument)
 - with respect to completeness: it represents a pointer so provide all the same comparisons as a pointer, versus it is a class type and only needs to be less-than comparable to be used in an associative container, so only provide that requirement

But I don't see why the choice *changes* depending on the smart pointer type. What am I missing?",5

Hi Folks,<BR>
First of all sorry, this is going to be a moderately long post.So, please have the patience to read it through.
</p>
<p>
Here, I am going to put down some concepts which I have learned while skimming through some articles on lock-free programming and present my doubts on that learning.<BR> Also, the discussion is on *NIX multiprocessor platform.
</p>
<p>
Starting by saying that ""LOCKLESS = BLOCKLESS"" as it is said that the system of threads as a whole makes progress because a CAS/DCAS can only fail if some thread has made progress.<BR>
So, we can say that, here in case of blocking on a mutex, we are spinning/waiting on a condition (The CAS while loop for eg.). <BR>
<BR>
<pre>
Quest1 > How would spinning on a while loop be more efficient than blocking on a<BR> mutex ?<BR>
Quest2 > A good design employing mutexes also ensure that system progresses, so<BR> isnt that BLOCKLESS too by definition? </pre>
</p>
<p>
As an answer to Question 1, one would argue that the blocking may go into kernel wait and there may be context switches which may be costly. Any further clarity on it would be appreciated.
</p>
<p>
Okay, assuming that after getting the answer for first 2 question I will be convinced to think that lock-free is really fast and real time when the atomic operations to be done <b>are not big/time consuming</b>.<BR>
<pre>
Quest3 > So, isnt lock-free something like spinlock ? If yes, why cant we use <BR>pthread spin lock ?

1) What happens when an Object/variable is thrown to catch? Say for example, 

    int foo() {
       FILE *fp = ....;
       int dummy = 10;
       int *dummy_ptr = new int[10];
       throw 1;
    }

    int main() {
     try {
       foo();
     } catch (int &i) { 
       std::cout<<""ERROR, the value is ""<<i<<std::endl;
     }
    }

In this situation, what happens here? A new variable created and then passed???

what if I use a pointer or a variable without reference

like 
    catch(int *i) // or catch (int i)


Also, does all the variables/resources declared or initiated inside the scope has been freed/closed?


2) Also in the case of rethrow,
if I plan to rethrow with a reference, the second catch gets a new variable, if I i rethrow with without reference (i.e) by value, then the changes done in the intermediate throw is not affected....

    int goo() {
        throw 2;
    }
 
    int foo() {
       try{
          goo();
       } catch(int &i) { // (or) catch(int i) // i is not changing in the next line.
          i = 2;
          throw;
       }
    }

    int main() {
     try {
       foo();
     } catch (int &i) { 
       std::cout<<""ERROR, the value is ""<<i<<std::endl;
     }
    }

OUTPUT:
     catch(int &i) // prints 2
     catch(int i)  // prints 1

From my judgment, 

What I think is, as long as it is reference, the value gets affected,
if its 'pass by value' in the intermediate step. it still throws the original object to the second catch. 

(i.e) the control flow for the variable is really not throw the intermediate catch.....

like 
    catch(int *i) // or catch (int i)


Also, does all the variables/resources declared or initiated inside the scope has been freed/closed?


2) Also in the case of rethrow,
if I plan to rethrow with a reference, the second catch gets a new variable, if I i rethrow with without reference (i.e) by value, then the changes done in the intermediate throw is not affected....

    int goo() {
        throw 2;
    }
 
    int foo() {
       try{
          goo();
       } catch(int &i) { // (or) catch(int i) // i is not changing in the next line.
          i = 2;
          throw;
       }
    }

    int main() {
     try {
       foo();
     } catch (int &i) { 
       std::cout<<""ERROR, the value is ""<<i<<std::endl;
     }
    }

OUTPUT:
     catch(int &i) // prints 2
     catch(int i)  // prints 1

From my judgment, 

What I think is, as long as it is reference, the value gets affected,
if its 'pass by value' in the intermediate step. it still throws the original object to the second catch. 

(i.e) the control flow for the variable is really not throw the intermediate catch.....

I want to be sure that the data has been delivered to the other party, and wonder if it is recommended to send back some acknowledgment message after (if) receiving data with **recv**.

Here are two possibilities, and please advice which way to go:

1. If **send** returns the size of passed buffer, assume that the data has been delivered at least to **recv** function on the other side of wire. When I say ""at least"", I mean even if the **recv** fails there (e.g. due to insufficient buffer, etc.), I don't care, I just want to be sure I've done my server part of work properly - I've sent the data completely (i.e. the data reached the other machine).

2. Use additional acknowledgment: after receiving the data with **recv**, send back some ID of received packet (part of header of each data sent) signaling the successful receive operation of that packet. If I don't receive such ""acknowledgment message"" after some interval, return failure code from the sender function.

The second answer looks more safe, but I don't want to complicate the transfer protocol if it is redundant. Also please note that I'm talking about the TCP connection (which is more safe by itself than UDP).

Is there any other mechanisms (maybe some other APIs? maybe **WSARecv()/WSASend()** work differently?) of ensuring that the data was delivered to the **recv** function on the other side?

If you recommend the second way, could you please give me some code snippet that allows me to use **recv** with timeout to receive the acknowledgment? **recv** is a blocking operation so it will hang forever if the previous send attempt failed (the other party was not notified). Is there any simple way of using **recv** with timeout (without creating separate thread every time which would probably be the overkill for each and every **send** operation).

Also the amount of data I pass to **send** function might be quite big (several megabytes), so how to choose the timeout for ""acknowledgment message""? Maybe I should ""split"" large buffers and use several **send** calls?

I saw that someone right [here][1] had the same error, and that the answer to this problem is correctly setting up the argument for compiling the program, however, I cannot figure out how to do this in NetBeans/Windows.

I realize that this can probably be written way more efficiently without a separate buffer/overhead for each wall but I'm new to OpenGL and experimenting at this point.

Problem: A mother class loops through a list of these structs and I only manage to draw the first. Here is the code:

 - Objective-C is more widely supported by Apple, and will be easier to interface with xCode and OpenGL (is that even true?)
 - I'm ridiculous for not using Cocoa if I'm already developing on a Mac
 - Since I'm currently developing on a Mac, I might as well learn Objective-C instead because it integrates more seamlessly with Cocoa

1. Main thread - Grabs image from a webcam, stored in a [CVD](http://www.edwardrosten.com/cvd/cvd/html/classCVD_1_1Image.html!) image. Does processing on this image.

2. Server thread - sends the full image data stored in the above CVD image to its clients using named pipes. 

When I run my program it works for a very short while before crashing with the following exception:

    0xC000005: Access violation reading location 0x0000000

Which I assume is because my server thread is attempting to access the image at the same time as the main thread.

I haven't done any concurrent programming before (this is my first time) but I have a vague idea about how to solve it at the moment.

My plan is to have some sort of lock that prevents access to the image from the main thread when the server is preparing to send it to the client. However I realised there might be a problem where the server thread constantly keeps the resource as the client is constantly requesting a new frame. So I am thinking to only respond to the client whenever a new frame is grabbed from the webcam to avoid the blocking issue above.

To sum this up:

Main thread:

    1. If Image is available
       then - Lock image, copy over new data from webcam, release image

       then - Lock CVD image access, send over frame, release image.
       else - wait until new image available.
    3. goto 1

My question is, would this be a suitable solution? and what do I need in order to implement this? i.e. how do I stop execution of certain parts of my code whilst another thread is executing a part of its own code.

Some more info:

1. I am using VS2010 C++ 
2. The client is in C# and there is only 1 client.
3. I am accessing the image data from the CVD image using image[x][y] which returns a byte value representing the intensity of the image.

Sprocket has a set of methods which I want to be callable from Widget but not from any other class. I also don't want to just declare Widget a friend of Spocket because that would give Widget access to ALL protected and private members. I want to restrict Widget's access to only a specific set of methods.

One solution I came up with is to create a nested class inside Sprocket that contains wrappers for these methods and make Widget a friend of this nested class. For example:
    
    class Sprocket
    {
    public:
        class WidgetInterface
        {
            friend class Widget;
            WidgetInterface(Sprocket* parent) : mParent(parent) {}
            
        private:
            void A() { mParent->A(); }
            void B() { mParent->B(); }
            
            Sprocket* mParent;
        };
        
    private:

    private:
        Sprocket::WidgetInterface mSprocketIface;
    };

This results in some code duplication because the method signatures are now declared in two places, but it works. But now suppose I want to add a subclass of Widget called SpecialWidget and I want that class to also have access to the Sprocket methods. I can simply add this new class to the Sprocket friends list or I can add yet another set of protected wrappers in Widget that SpecialWidget (and any other subclass) can access but you can see that this is now becoming a maintenance issue. I don't want to have to update the friends list or the wrappers if I add new classes or change the method signature.

Well, as told me in the previous question, there is the possibility to use iterators on property_tree in Boost, but I do not know what type it is... and what methods or properties I can use...

Well, I assume that it must be another ptree or something representing another xml hierarchy to be browsed again (if I want) but documentation about this is very bad... I do not know why, but in boost docs I cannot find nothing good about this... just something about a macro to browse nodes, but this approach is one I would really like to avoid...

Well, the question is so...
Once getting the iterator on a ptree, how can I access node name, value, parameters (a node in a xml file)?

In this case the types `int32_t` etc are _not_ the `std` ones - they are implementation defined.

    MyClass(unsigned long long z);

Note, I can't replace this interface with `std::int32_t` style types - if I could I wouldn't need to ask this question ;)

The problem is how to call the correct `obj_from_` function based on the number of bits in the integral type. I have tried the following:

    // Helper functions

The intent is the compiler will pick the correct overload for the integral type, and boost does the hard work behind the scenes mapping the number of bits to types for each architecture. 

The problem is this fails on gcc (4.6.3) (but not of MSVC - so I've been given (false?) hope!). The error is:

    In constructor 'MyClass(long int)':

## Used technologies ##
It is programmed in C++. For the moment, the graph is implemented thanks to the BGL.

## About the graph ##
The managed graph is dynamic and undirected. It has two kinds of structures: a lot of complete subgraphs and few of single edges. The only needed information is the direct neighborhood of a vertex.

## Problem statement ##
At the beginning, the complete subgraphs were small (about 10 vertices) and numerous (about 13k). An adjacency list implementation, the BGL's one, was perfect. But now, it is asked to manage few subgraph of 5000 vertices. That means 5000x5000 edges. The performance in time and space are then very poor now.

## Rejected solutions ##
My first thought was to use the adjacency matrix implementation provided by BGL. But it doesn't allow dynamic graph. To resolve this constraint, two solutions: provide a new implementation of adjacency matrix for dynamic graph or use a pool of available vertices in a static graph. After reflection, I think it's not a good idea: the space complexity is still VxV/2.

## Final Solution and question ##
So, here my final solution: don't use the BGL, implement bags of vertices to represent complete subgraphs (no need of edges) and directly connect vertices for the few single edges. By doing so, the space complexity of the biggest subgraph falls to its number of vertices, about 5000.

<b> Overview: </b> 

I am trying to improve the design of a program that I am using state pattern for.  I will post a brief description of the problem, an image of the class diagram/description of the current design, followed by header code for the relevant classes.

<b>Problem: </b>

I'm using a variation of the State Pattern for a program.  In this variation, I have a 'controller' that utilizes two abstract classes, 'state' and 'event', which several concrete types are extended from both.  These two abstract classes are used to carry out responses to 'events' that vary based upon the type of event, and the current state.  Each state has a 'handler' function that is overloaded to take each concrete event type.

The 'controller' contains a queue of type 'event' (the abstract class), which contains the list of of 'events' (concrete classes) that have occurred.  The controller 'processes' each event one at a time, by retrieving it from the queue, and passing it to the state's handler for that particular type of event.

The problem is that in order to get the correct type to pass the event to the state's appropriate handler, I have to <b>downcast</b> the event to the correct concrete type.  Currently, I accomplish this by adding a method to class 'state' (getType()) which is implemented by each concrete event type, and returns an integer that represents that event type.  However, this practice is very 'un-elegant' and results in using enums to drive 'switch' blocks and 'downcasting' - which are not very good design practices.

How can I change this design to make the passing of events to states more elegant?

<b> Overview: </b> 

I am trying to improve the design of a program that I am using state pattern for.  I will post a brief description of the problem, an image of the class diagram/description of the current design, followed by header code for the relevant classes.

<b>Problem: </b>

I'm using a variation of the State Pattern for a program.  In this variation, I have a 'controller' that utilizes two abstract classes, 'state' and 'event', which several concrete types are extended from both.  These two abstract classes are used to carry out responses to 'events' that vary based upon the type of event, and the current state.  Each state has a 'handler' function that is overloaded to take each concrete event type.

The 'controller' contains a queue of type 'event' (the abstract class), which contains the list of of 'events' (concrete classes) that have occurred.  The controller 'processes' each event one at a time, by retrieving it from the queue, and passing it to the state's handler for that particular type of event.

The problem is that in order to get the correct type to pass the event to the state's appropriate handler, I have to <b>downcast</b> the event to the correct concrete type.  Currently, I accomplish this by adding a method to class 'state' (getType()) which is implemented by each concrete event type, and returns an integer that represents that event type.  However, this practice is very 'un-elegant' and results in using enums to drive 'switch' blocks and 'downcasting' - which are not very good design practices.

How can I change this design to make the passing of events to states more elegant?

Now in objective-c I can't return an object, only an object pointer. Would this be an appropriate place to use autorelease (before returning?). This would enable me to chain the methods on the Vector3D class (since many methods return the object itself) but would this be particularly inefficient as compared to manually allocating and releasing the objects?

For all I can figure out, they're pretty much the same (but I'm probably wrong!)

To me, an iterator allows iteration of a container with no knowledge of the container itself. A cursor, on the other hand, allows iteration of a container as well but has implementation details specific to the container type, so it does keep a reference to the container. Additionally a cursor's interface mirrors the interface of the container kind of like the facade pattern.

Here is an example of what I would consider a cursor:

    class Book {};
    
    class Library
    {
        std::vector<Book> books;
    
        bool IsBookHardCover( int bookIndex );
        bool IsBookSoftCover( int bookIndex );

    {
        std::vector<Book>& books;
        int currentBook;
    
        bool IsHardCover();
        bool IsSoftCover();
    
        void Next();
    };

So basically I make the distinction between iterators and cursors based on their dependency or knowledge of the container they iterate. Is this an appropriate distinction? If not, what would you consider the design pattern I've outlined in my code example above?

I'm about to start working on a fairly simple (**C++**) game that simulates realistically the motion of a spacecraft in the solar system. As you might guess, **the graphics needed are very basic**:

 - The planets are just spheres with textures;
 - The spacecraft have few or no moving parts (rotation and translation only);
 - I might need a few lighting/animation effects to make it pretty.

[Celestia][1] is aesthetically very close to what I'm thinking about.

Now, the problem is that until now I've only used C++ for scientific simulations, and I have **no experience** whatsoever in graphical interfaces and games in general. 
Also, I don't want to spend months learning how to use a complex engine.

My question is: **which engine is easy to learn and use, while still producing nice-looking graphics?** I'm looking for the best balance.

As far as I can tell, the 3 most suggested OSS engines are Ogre3D, Irrlich and Crystal Space 3D.

I'm about to start working on a fairly simple (**C++**) game that simulates realistically the motion of a spacecraft in the solar system. As you might guess, **the graphics needed are very basic**:

 - The planets are just spheres with textures;
 - The spacecraft have few or no moving parts (rotation and translation only);
 - I might need a few lighting/animation effects to make it pretty.

[Celestia][1] is aesthetically very close to what I'm thinking about.

Now, the problem is that until now I've only used C++ for scientific simulations, and I have **no experience** whatsoever in graphical interfaces and games in general. 
Also, I don't want to spend months learning how to use a complex engine.

My question is: **which engine is easy to learn and use, while still producing nice-looking graphics?** I'm looking for the best balance.

As far as I can tell, the 3 most suggested OSS engines are Ogre3D, Irrlich and Crystal Space 3D. By comparing a few youtube videos, Crystal Space's graphics look the best, but it's apparently a bit messy to use. They say that Irrlich is easier, but to me it also looks inferior in terms of graphical results. Ogre3D looks good but I don't know how much beginner-friendly it is.

But I think it'll be much worse if I don't ask it at all.

When a discussion begins about the features of Python that the developers love the most, they usually mention list comprehension, syntax relying on indentation (thus avoiding brackets, etc.) and some other.

At such moments I ask myself a question why there can't be made a language based on C++ but having a syntax like in Python and having all the features like list comprehensions, generators.

I understand that such a language won't have all the features that Python has, e.g. `eval` or `exac` statements (because they rely on Python being an interpreting language), may be some others that I don't know of.

But I also know that there is a project called Shedskin which makes a C code of a Python code (with some restrictions on what can be used in Python code).

So, are there some real reasons why it's impossible to create such a language that will combine all the best features of Python and a very fast code that produces C++? Or it's just the turn of events that Python for some reasons became very popular and it turned out to be interpreted, so a lot of people use it for its greatest features still discontent at the speed of the code, and some of them struggle to create something (like Shedskin or Psyco) to speed it up?",c++,python,,,,11/30/2011 11:45:45,not constructive,1,236,11,"Why C++ can't be made as Python in terms of convenience This question may seem to be naive.

Here is the thing: I have an **Enemy** class that has contains member variables like _name__ and _health__. I want to create instances of it with different values of these member variables and my first approach was to get the parameters from a static array with the properties:

    Enemy::Enemy(int type) : name_(properties[type].name),

The problem here is that I can't check if the array _properties_ is already filled. I would have to check it from outside by calling a static _Enemy::initArray()_ function but this would defeat the encapsulation of the **Enemy** class.

Is this the time to create a factory that would initialize the _properties_ array in it's constructor? And then create Enemies with:

    Enemy* EnemyFactory::create(type);

I read that usually factories are created when you have complex class hierarchies or the factory caller only needs to know the interface of the created classes. I only need the encapsulation of the array creation and verification. Is there a ""lighter"" solution?

- Python on CPython 2.7.2 : 8.8s
- C++ with libstdc++: 5.9s
- Java on OpenJDK 7: 50.4s

Surprisingly! I tried ""-O2, -O3"" in C++ but noting helped. C++ seems about only 50% performance of javascript in V8, and even poor than CPython. Could anyone explain to me if I had missed some optimization in GCC or is this just the case? Thank you a lot.

It's not surprising that Nodejs performas better than Python or Java. But I expected libstdc++ would give much better performance than Nodejs, whose result really suprised me.

    #include <iostream>
    #include <string>
    using namespace std;
    void test()
    {
        int x = 0;
        int limit = 102 * 1024;
        string s("""");
        for (; s.size() < limit;) {
            s += ""X"";
            if (s.find(""ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"", 0) != string::npos)
                cout << ""Find!"" << endl;

        cout << ""x's length = "" << s.size() << endl;
    }

    int main()

Brief Summary
-----------
OK, now let's see the summary:

- javascript on Nodejs(V8): 3.1s
- Python on CPython 2.7.2 : 8.8s
- C++ with libstdc++: 5.9s
- Java on OpenJDK 7: 50.4s

Surprisingly! I tried ""-O2, -O3"" in C++ but noting helped. C++ seems about only 50% performance of javascript in V8, and even poor than CPython. Could anyone explain to me if I had missed some optimization in GCC or is this just the case? Thank you a lot.

Thanks!",c++,python,,,,,open,0,517,9,"Trying to understand linking procedure for writing Python/C++ hybrid I want to start learning more about using SWIG and other methods to interface Python and C++. To get started, I wanted to compile this simple program mentioned in [another post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9824949/how-to-solve-the-segmentation-fault-when-hybrid-programming-of-c-python):

    #include <Python.h>

     { 
          Py_Initialize(); 

          PyObject* pModule = NULL;

          pModule = PyImport_ImportModule(""hello"");
          if(pModule == NULL){
               printf(""Error importing module."");
               exit(-1);
          }
     
     
          pFunc   = PyObject_GetAttrString(pModule, ""Hello""); 
          PyEval_CallObject(pFunc, NULL); 
          Py_Finalize(); 
          return 0; 
     }
    
where the file ""hello.py"" just has the contents:

     def Hello():
         print ""Hello world!""

**Note:** I already have python2.7-dev and python-dev and libboost-python-dev installed. But when I go to compile the code, I get errors that I believe are due to incorrectly linking to the Python libraries.

---------------
I am currently working on a small application that grabs the RGB and depth map streams from a Microsoft Kinect device and saves them on disk for future analysis. Whn I run the program it shall output each frame as a separate image on disk.

The framerate of the Kinect is 30fps, but there are two sources so make this (approximately) 60fps. If I naively try to just save each frame when it arrives I will get dropped frames as is demonstrated by the bundled [freenect/record.c][1] application.

I rewrote the application to use one thread that grabs the frames from the device and pushes them to the back of a double ended list (`std::deque`). Then there are two threads that each pop frames from the front of the double ended list and saves the frames to disk.
When the recording is turned off, there is a potentially large number of frames left in the list that still need to be recorded, so before exiting we let the two save threads do their work until finished.

Now the actual problem
-------------------------
Although the problem of dropped frames is solved, writes to the filesystem are still quite slow. Is there any good way to speed up the file creation on disk?
Currently, the function `dump_frame` looks like this:

    static void
    dump_frame(struct frame* frame)
    {
    	FILE* fp;
    	char filename[512]; /* plenty of space! */
    
    	sprintf(filename, ""d-%f-%u.pgm"", get_time, frame->timestamp);
    
    	fp = fopen(filename, ""w"");
    	fprintf(fp, ""P5 %d %d 65535\n"", frame->width, frame->height);
    	fwrite(frame->data, frame->size, 1, fp);
    	fclose(fp);
    }

The application is working great, but after a seemingly random amount of accepted and closed connections, the server refuses to receive or send data thru the sockets. I can make the connection with `telnet`, but when I type something, I don't get back a response.

I have had times the server accepted up to 370 connections until it refused working, but last time it only accepted 70 connections.

I don't think it has to do with the closing of the sockets, which I think I do properly. This is my `netstat` and `lsof` output when I start the application. But I haven't really got a clue how to interpret them. I just found these when googling.

This file is the result of measures made by sensors : each bracket-thingy represents the interval of values of a sensor, and each different line represents a measure.

The problem is, we sometimes switch-off certain sensors, so the file won't have the same format, so I really don't know how to do a ""general"" parser, which shouldn't consider the number of sensors that was switched-on.

Of course, I don't know if it's clear, this number of values is different from a file to another. I mean, in a same file, the number of values is obviously constant.

The output format would be : 

    LINE 1:
        x1min: ... (first value of the first bracket-couple)
        x1max: ... (second value of the second bracket-couple)

So it seems it must be some totally non-standard implementation that has allowed them to justify calling this feature ""partially"" done.  How would I rewrite that code to access the forwarding and strong type feature?",c++,c++0x,vs2010rc,,,,open,0,231,4,"forward/strong enum in VS2010 At http://blogs.msdn.com/vcblog/archive/2010/04/06/c-0x-core-language-features-in-vc10-the-table.aspx there is a table showing C++0x features that are implemented in 2010 RC.  Among them are listed forwarding enums and strongly typed enums but they are listed as ""partial"".  The main text of the article says that this means they are either incomplete or implemented in some non-standard way.

So I've got VS2010RC and am playing around with the C++0x features.  I can't figure these ones out and can't find any documentation on these two features.  Not even the simplest attempts compile.

The question is, is there any way to limit the *size* of the hash to emulate the fact that my hardware is of finite size?  I'd expect the hash's *insert* method to return an error message or throw an exception if the limit is reached.

If there is no such way, I'll simply check its size before trying to insert, but that seems like an inelegant way to do it.

Hello,

It wasn't for just a few times that I stumbled into an object construction statement that I didn't understand, and it was only today that I noticed what ambiguity was being introduced by it. I'll explain how to reproduce it and would like to know if there's a way to fix it (C++0x allowed). Here it goes.

Suppose there is a class whose constructor takes only one argument, and this one argument's type is another class with a default constructor. E.g.:

    struct ArgType {};

    class Class
    {
    public:
        Class(ArgType arg);
    };

If I try to construct an object of type `Class` on the stack, I get an ambiguity:

    Class c(ArgType()); // is this an object construction or a forward declaration
                        // of a function ""c"" returning `Class` and taking a pointer
                        // to a function returning `ArgType` and taking no arguments
                        // as argument? (oh yeh, loli haets awkward syntax in teh
                        // saucecode)

I say it's an object construction, but the compiler insists it's a forward declaration inside the function body. For you who still doesn't get it, here is a fully working example:

    #include <iostream>

    struct ArgType {};
    struct Class {};

    ArgType func()
    {
        std::cout << ""func()\n"";
        return ArgType();
    }

    int main()
    {
        Class c(ArgType());

        c(func); // prints ""func()\n""
    }

    Class c(ArgType funcPtr()) // Class c(ArgType (*funcPtr)()) also works
    {
        funcPtr();
        return Class();
    }

So well, enough examples.

Let's start I decade or two back in time, all was well in the world. I spoke to my neighbor and he spoke the same language: just plain English. To me, my neighbor and Windows it seemed obvious to store our string in 8-bit `char`s because all characters we used could be stored in the 2^8=256 available combinations.

Then the miraculous being *Internet* came along and allowed me to speak to some friends in Europe (who had no time to learn English). This got difficult with our `char` format, the number of used characters exceeded 256 easily so in our utterly simplistic vision we decided to use the 16-bit `wchar_t`s. Something called UCS-2 unicode. It has 2^16=65.536 available combinations and that must be enough for every language in the world! Convinced of our correctness we even added 16-bit Windows API `W` functions like `MessageBoxW` and `CreateWindowW`. We convinced every programmer of our religion and discouraged the use of the evil 8-bit counterparts (`MessageBoxA` and `CreateWindowA`) and mapped a call to `MessageBox` automatically to `MessageBoxW` by defining `_UNICODE` in our builds. Therefore we should also use the `wcs` functions instead of the old `str` functions (e.g. `strlen` should now be `wcslen`, or use the automatically mapped `_tcslen`).

Then things got bad, it turned out there were other people in the world who used even weirder glyphs (no offence) than ours: Japanese, Chinese, etc. It got bad because for example Chinese has over 70.000 different characters. A lot of swearing occurred and left us with a new type of unicode: UTF-16. It also uses a 16-bit data type but some characters require two 16-bit values (called a [surrogate pair](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd374069(v=vs.85).aspx)). Which means we can't use indexes on these 16-bit strings (e.g. theString[4] may not return the 5th character). To patch the Windows API it was decided all `W` functions should now support the UTF-16 format, it was an easy decision since all old UCS-2 strings were valid UTF-16 strings as well. However, because we are brave programmers, we now use the `wcs` functions. Sadly these functions are not surrogate aware and still conform to the UCS-2 format...

In the meantime, in a dark attic, another more compact form of unicode was developed: UTF-8. Using an 8-bit data type most western languages can be stored in a single 8-bit value, just like in the old days. When a more exotic glyph is stored, multiple 8-bit values are used, for most European languages 2 will suffice. However it may expand up 4 of these values, essentially creating a 32-bit storage type. Just like it's fat brother UTF-16, we cannot use indexes on these strings. Because of it's more compact format UTF-8 is now widely used everywhere on the Internet because it saves bandwidth.

Good, you made it though my lengthy write-up :) Now I have some questions / points of interest:

1. Okay, I'm pretty satisfied with using UTF-8 for storage. When I read a file (from disk or HTTP response) I detect the UTF-8 signature `""\xEF\xBB\xBF""` and put the contents through `MultiByteToWideChar` which leaves me with an UTF-16 string. I can use that with the `W` API functions, no problem. But now I want to modify the string, replace some characters etc. The good old `wcs` functions are no good anymore, what core string functions are UTF-16 aware? Or is there some splendid library out there I don't know off?

2. Don't you have the feeling an ugly mistake was made when we were forced upon using 16-bit deficient `W` functions. Shouldn't the problem have been recognized in a much earlier stage and let all original API functions take on UTF-8 strings and incorporate proper string manipulation routines? Or is that already possible and am I horribly mistaken?

3. For fast index access to the characters we should store strings in 32-bit values. Is this common? (I can hear you thinking: and then we hit an extraterrestrial language requiring more combinations and the fun starts all over again...)

I think you deserved yourself a fine cup of tea struggling though this lengthy question, go get one before you answer ;)

",c++,,,,,07/11/2012 19:06:50,off topic,1,2097,8,"converting c++ programming to use more advanced techniques I wrote a c++ program using simple techniques (with a lot of help from the community here), and now I've been trying to brush up on some more advanced c++ techniques. I already see the opportunity for dynamic memory with the 'words' array and some of the others. What other parts of the program should I change to use better/more advanced programming techniques?

C++,"I'm not really looking for someone to write the code for me but I need help just starting. The requirements are as follows:

Description:
Write a program that finds the greatest product of four adjacent numbers in any direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) in the 2020 grid of numbers. 

Input:
Since the concept of file I/O has not been introduced yet, all data can be obtained by the way of the stdin prompt in an interactive fashion. You can then feed the data to your program from a file by using file redirection. The input file will contain the matrix of numbers. The data will be presented from the top left of the table to bottom right.

Output:

The final results should consist of the (i,j) index of each of the four numbers. The next line should print the numbers and the final producet of the four. 

Specific Requirements:

Your program should contain at least one two dimensional array.
Your program should adhere to standard programming practices and should not use any global variables.
Your program should contain at least three functions. One for accepting the data from stdin, one for printing the final results to stdout and one other function that is used during your calculations. 
Your program must be prepared to work for an nx20 matrix of data. The value of n needs to be passed to the program via the command line argument. The example below is for a 20x20 matrix and the command line argument would consist of ""a.out 20"".

We have considered various alternatives:

 - Exceptions - Basically we’re sold on the cons as described here: http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/38449/C-Exceptions-Pros-and-Cons
 - Passing an additional string ref parm which is populated with error text - but it requires a pre-instantiation of the error string prior to the call, and adds bulk to the parm lists
 - Populating a ‘last_error’ member variable - this seems to suffer (imo) the drawbacks expressed here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9099981/is-getlasterror-kind-of-design-pattern-is-it-good-mechanism
 - Passing back an enum (or the like) which can be mapped to a description of the error with some other function - but this feels ‘heavy’ for small functions and objects, and also creates space between the place the error occurs and the place where the messages are maintained (though I suppose in multi-ligual environment they’d appreciate the centralization of the text).

So I wondered if we could create a set of classes like the following:

    class CResult
    {
    protected:
       CResult()
       {
          // Don't have to initialize because the derived class will do it
       }
    public:
       operator bool() { return m_Result; };
    
       bool m_Result;
       CString m_Message;
    };
    
    class CSuccess : public CResult

    public:

       {
    	   m_Result = true;
       }
    };
    
    class CFailure : public CResult
    {
    public:
       CFailure(const CString & Message)
       {
          m_Result = false;
          m_Message = Message;
       }
    };

Then the above code could look like this:

    CResult DoSomething(CString Value)
    {
       if(Value == ""bad"")
       {
          return CFailure(""description of error"");
       }
       return CSuccess();
    }

What I like about it:

 - The code is still readable and the error message is maintained near the error condition
 - The programmer will be slightly more compelled to actually provide an error string on an error condition (yes, they could provide blanks but that would seem a more egregious mistake, imo)
 - The caller doesn’t have to create any specialized variables prior to the function call, and can still treat the function result like a bool - or in a case where the error is not ignored, easily retrieve an explanation
 - The next programmer can what error model is in use just by looking at the function definition

The main drawback I see is that there is higher overhead on success, in that an object and a string and a bool will all be instantiated - but a lot of the times in our app the code in question is not performance sensitive, such as validating user input, etc.

Sorry for the long post, but I want things to be clear with a concrete example, rather than discussion on vague ideas.

As I understand, top-down design is by refining the abstract high level concept into smaller concrete and comprehensible parts, until the smallest building block is defined. 

On the other hand, bottom up defines low level parts, then gradually build up higher level blocks until the whole system is formed.

In practice, it is said best to combine the two methods: starts with high level specification to fully specify the domain knowledge, its relationship and constraints. Once the problem is well understood, smallest building blocks are created to build up the system. 

The process of:

 - Creating requirement spec
 - Create a design spec (with diagrams)
 - Implement
 - Deliver
 - Repeat (in iterative development, rather than doing a whole chunk in each phase, we do a little bit each repeatedly, and got daily meeting to adapt to customer's dynamic requirement)

look perfectly normal to me (with specs as plans). 

Let's take an example: Suppose I'm going to write a Web Server. Since probably all of us have basic understanding of the domain knowledge (which is about server and network), I won't write requirement spec. For design spec, these components are needed to define (from the perspective of C++):

 - Server: A component to unite related components.
 - Acceptor: To accept connection and identify what type of connection is (HTTP, FTP...)
 - Connection Manager: To manage connections, include storing a collection of connections, and process connection according to each of its states (such as alive/not responding/time out).
 - Connection: Represent each connection, and takes care of basic actions like send/receive data.
 - Session Manager: Manage the session data of each connection. It associates state data with a reference to each connection.
 - Module Manager: Manage how the server is adapted to user created module in order to exten its functionality.

After the overview of each component, I further refine each into lower level details:

 - Acceptor: An abstract class to represent a generic acceptor.
    - HttpAcceptor: A class to accept and validate if a connection is Http, which connects through port 80.
    - FtpAcceeptor: Same as HttpAcceptor, except for Ftp and port 22
 - Connection Manager: A class to keep a collection of active connections and perform said functionalities    
 - Connection: A generic connection class
    - HttpConnection: Process the request and response of Http messages.
    - FtpConnection: Process the request and response of Ftp messages.
 - Session Manager: Use something like `std::map` to associate session data and a reference of a connection.
    - SessionData: A class contains the `std::map` of `<Key, Value>` pairs for keeping state data of a website. The `<Key,Value>` pair is implemented using `template<class Key, class Value>`.
 
This is an oversimplification design I thought on top of my head for this example based on basic understanding. Of course, it will have flaws, but that's why we got iterative development: instead of spending time on one phase, says, requirement analysis to study every possible thing in domain knowledge which is subjected to changes (possibly daily), we do a little bit of analysis, a little bit of design and then implements it, in a day. Another way is that each iteration is a mini-waterfall fashion, where analysis is done in a few days (or a week). The same applies for design. The rest of time is spent for implementation. Then we deliver a build to our clients. 

If requirement is unclear, we keep study the domain model until we have a spec which is implementable. I can't imagine jump right into programming without, even basic, up front planning.

**What's wrong with top-down approach in combination with iterative development?** 

In his essay about bottom-up programming, **did Paul Graham encourage build from bottom up completely? Or just program it from bottom up, but not the requirement analysis/desing phase?** Because in one of his paragraph, he said:

> Experienced Lisp programmers divide up their programs differently. As
> well as top-down design, they follow a principle which could be called
> bottom-up design-- changing the language to suit the problem.

As far as I get, what he meant is that Lisper still performs top-down design, but program bottom up, is that true? Another point he said:

> It's worth emphasizing that bottom-up design doesn't mean just writing
> the same program in a different order. When you work bottom-up, you
> usually end up with a different program. Instead of a single,
> monolithic program, you will get a larger language with more abstract
> operators, and a smaller program written in it. Instead of a lintel,
> you'll get an arch.

**This means, during the period of writing a program in Lisp, you end up with a generic tool which can be used to write similar programs of the original one, doesn't it?**

Sorry for the long post, but I want things to be clear with a concrete example, rather than discussion on vague ideas.

As I understand, top-down design is by refining the abstract high level concept into smaller concrete and comprehensible parts, until the smallest building block is defined. 

On the other hand, bottom up defines low level parts, then gradually build up higher level blocks until the whole system is formed.

In practice, it is said best to combine the two methods: starts with high level specification to fully specify the domain knowledge, its relationship and constraints. Once the problem is well understood, smallest building blocks are created to build up the system. 

The process of:

 - Creating requirement spec
 - Create a design spec (with diagrams)
 - Implement
 - Deliver
 - Repeat (in iterative development, rather than doing a whole chunk in each phase, we do a little bit each repeatedly, and got daily meeting to adapt to customer's dynamic requirement)

look perfectly normal to me (with specs as plans). 

Let's take an example: Suppose I'm going to write a Web Server. Since probably all of us have basic understanding of the domain knowledge (which is about server and network), I won't write requirement spec. For design spec, these components are needed to define (from the perspective of C++):

 - Server: A component to unite related components.
 - Acceptor: To accept connection and identify what type of connection is (HTTP, FTP...)
 - Connection Manager: To manage connections, include storing a collection of connections, and process connection according to each of its states (such as alive/not responding/time out).
 - Connection: Represent each connection, and takes care of basic actions like send/receive data.
 - Session Manager: Manage the session data of each connection. It associates state data with a reference to each connection.
 - Module Manager: Manage how the server is adapted to user created module in order to exten its functionality.

After the overview of each component, I further refine each into lower level details:

 - Acceptor: An abstract class to represent a generic acceptor.
    - HttpAcceptor: A class to accept and validate if a connection is Http, which connects through port 80.
    - FtpAcceeptor: Same as HttpAcceptor, except for Ftp and port 22
 - Connection Manager: A class to keep a collection of active connections and perform said functionalities    
 - Connection: A generic connection class
    - HttpConnection: Process the request and response of Http messages.
    - FtpConnection: Process the request and response of Ftp messages.
 - Session Manager: Use something like `std::map` to associate session data and a reference of a connection.
    - SessionData: A class contains the `std::map` of `<Key, Value>` pairs for keeping state data of a website. The `<Key,Value>` pair is implemented using `template<class Key, class Value>`.
 
This is an oversimplification design I thought on top of my head for this example based on basic understanding. Of course, it will have flaws, but that's why we got iterative development: instead of spending time on one phase, says, requirement analysis to study every possible thing in domain knowledge which is subjected to changes (possibly daily), we do a little bit of analysis, a little bit of design and then implements it, in a day. Another way is that each iteration is a mini-waterfall fashion, where analysis is done in a few days (or a week). The same applies for design. The rest of time is spent for implementation. Then we deliver a build to our clients. 

If requirement is unclear, we keep study the domain model until we have a spec which is implementable. I can't imagine jump right into programming without, even basic, up front planning.

**What's wrong with top-down approach in combination with iterative development?** 

In his essay about bottom-up programming, **did Paul Graham encourage build from bottom up completely? Or just program it from bottom up, but not the requirement analysis/desing phase?** Because in one of his paragraph, he said:

> Experienced Lisp programmers divide up their programs differently. As
> well as top-down design, they follow a principle which could be called
> bottom-up design-- changing the language to suit the problem.

As far as I get, what he meant is that Lisper still performs top-down design, but program bottom up, is that true? Another point he said:

> It's worth emphasizing that bottom-up design doesn't mean just writing
> the same program in a different order. When you work bottom-up, you
> usually end up with a different program. Instead of a single,
> monolithic program, you will get a larger language with more abstract
> operators, and a smaller program written in it. Instead of a lintel,
> you'll get an arch.

**This means, during the period of writing a program in Lisp, you end up with a generic tool which can be used to write similar programs of the original one, doesn't it?**

I load a bmp file to a DC using LoadImage, and it shows up properly. However, when I call DeleteObject, the memory doesn't seem to be freed. (I use windows task manager to track the memory usage)

In the WM_INITDIALOG part I do this:

    static HBITMAP hBitmap = 0;
    char* tempPath = ""tabView.bmp"";  
    hBitmap = (HBITMAP)LoadImage(NULL,
                                 tempPath,	// file containing bitmap
                                 IMAGE_BITMAP,	// type = bitmap
                                 0, 0,		// original size
                                 LR_LOADFROMFILE);		// get image from a file

                    (LPARAM)hBitmap);     // bitmap handle
    }

So the picture shows up in the DC, and memory increases. And in a button I do:

    int result = DeleteObject(hBitmap);

When I press the button, I checked the result and it's a non-zero value, which is success. But IDC_PICTURE will still show the picture, and memory stays the same. I am wondering if the SendMessage() may increase the ref count on the hBitmap...

So, if I have to delete the Bullet object, from all these places, how should I do it so that there are no more dangling references to it? 

    std::list< Bullet*>::iterator bullet_it;
    
    	for( bullet_it = (a_pCell->m_BulletPList).begin(); bullet_it != (a_pCell->m_BulletPList).end(); bullet_it++) {
    
    		bool l_Bullet_trash = false;
    		Bullet* bullet1 = *bullet_it;

    		// conditions would set this to true
    
    		if ( l_Bullet_Trash )
    			// TrashBullet( bullet1 );
    			continue;
    		}


----------


Also, I was reading about [list::remove][1], and it mentions that it calls the destructor of the object we are trying to delete. Given this info, if I delete from one list, the object does not exist, but the list would still contain a reference to it..How do I handle all these problems ? Can someone please help me here ?

Thanks

PS: If you want me to post more code or provide explanation, please do let me know.

Basically when I try and load the image in a QGraphicsScene it seems to scale up to the size of the image but displays a white screen. I can add text to the graphics scene fine and that will display correctly. Now if I try to do add the image into a label on a different widget it displays fine. Any ideas why?

I am now planning how I am going to handle animation and optimize rendering. I'm rendering using immediate mode which I was told was very slow. I go looking for alternatives and then there's a bunch of different ways, and it differs depending on how you handle the animations, so I thought I'd just ask what would be a good optimal way to do both.

For animations, I thought about using sequences of images stored in memory, but only testing with a 50 image sequence, memory jumped to like 200 mb, when it was 30 before. (There's no leak, it stays at 200, but if I have large levels, it looks like I'll be running out of memory). Would sprite sheets help in this case?

I was told the reason atlases or sprite sheets were used was because binding different textures was an expensive operation, so the only way this would work is by putting in all the texture I will use for level 1 for example in one huge texture so I'm only binding once. Is this possible dynamically? 

Would using one gigantic PNG be better memory-wise than loading 50 PNG's?

I want the camera to be able to 'look around' and not for it to 'orbit' around a point, this point being the OpenGL origin.

I am aware that 'there is no camera in OpenGL', the terrain moves and not the viewpoint, etc. and all of those similar concepts but it has not helped me in solving this. 

Unfortunately I am stubborn and want to write my code with no deprecated features and so this eliminates 99% of the similar situations I have read about since most of those solutions were with gluLook and similar functions. 

The matrix class I am using is similar to the one that is used by the OpenGL SuperBible 5th Edition ( [source](http://oglsuperbible5.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Src/GLTools/), GLFrame.h is the main file of interest) but have adapted it to use the [OpenGL Mathematics Library](http://glm.g-truc.net/).

The typical response to this question is to translate to the origin, rotate, then translate back, but this does nothing for me.

Some code:

    void rotateLocalX( GLfloat p_Angle )
    {
        if( ( m_Roll < m_RollLimit ) && ( m_Roll > ( -m_RollLimit ) ) )
        {
            //store away the current location so I can translate back to it
            glm::vec3 tempOrigin = getOrigin( );

            m_Roll += p_Angle;

            // Go to the Origin

            //you can also subtract the current location to get to 0.f

            //also doing glm::translate( m_Matrix, -( tempOrigin ) ); -> rotate -> 
            //glm::translate( m_Matrix, tempOrigin ) has the same result
            m_Matrix[ 3 ][ 0 ] = 0.f;
            m_Matrix[ 3 ][ 1 ] = 0.f;
            m_Matrix[ 3 ][ 2 ] = 0.f;
            m_Matrix[ 3 ][ 3 ] = 1.f;

            // Rotate the matrix
            m_Matrix = glm::rotate( m_Matrix, p_Angle, glm::vec3( 1.f, 0.f, 0.f ) );

            // Go back to the original location
            m_Matrix[ 3 ][ 0 ] = tempOrigin.x;
            m_Matrix[ 3 ][ 1 ] = tempOrigin.y;
            m_Matrix[ 3 ][ 2 ] = tempOrigin.z;
            m_Matrix[ 3 ][ 3 ] = 1.f;

            normalize( );
        }
    }

And if it is of any consequence, I am treating the camera matrix as the view matrix (with a separate model matrix [view*model=modelview] and a perspective projection matrix).

Finally a typical frame goes like this: check for input (move/rotate camera as appropriate), render skybox (ignoring the origin/location column of the view/camera matrix), draw everything else (taking into account the entire view matrix).

Finally a typical frame goes like this: check for input (move/rotate camera as appropriate), render skybox (ignoring the origin/location column of the view/camera matrix), draw everything else (taking into account the entire view matrix).

I apologize for asking such a common question but two days of searching and trying various different solutions has yielded no positive results.

Thank you.",3

Does anyone of you know of any foundations/philanthropists who may be interested to fund my project in return for open sourcing the code?

The funding will serve as an incentive for me to finish the library - perhaps by taking a sabbatical :p - and, of course, as 'payment' for the intellectual property involved.

I've searched the web, contacted some [e.g., foundations, VCs, angels, etc.], but I either did not get a response (from VCs and angels) or was rejected (one reason is geography since these foundations support only US-based projects).

So, the first line calls getAIMove() and assigns the return value (char*) to aiMove.

The second line prints aiMove (a0 a1).

The third line takes numMoves and aiMove into cout and prints it, but it's printing some strange value instead.

The 4th line returns aiMove, which I've inspected to be the strange value printed.

Why has the value of aiMove changed? It seems to only happen when I pass an integer value into cout (in this case, numMoves).

 There was a previous question on this very website [here][2] where this tutorial was discussed, namely regarding how the variables in the class were preserved because the whole class was passed back by value.

 Whilst experimenting with the class definition I toyed with making the integer variables pointers (perhaps not sensible - but just to experiment!) as follows:

    class CVector {  
      
      int* x;
      int* y;
      
      public:
      
      CVector () {};
      CVector (int,int);
      CVector operator + (CVector);
      ~CVector ();
    };

In the class constructor I allocate memory for the two integers, and in the class deconstructor I delete the allocated memory.

 I also tweak the overloaded operator function as follows:

    CVector CVector::operator+ (CVector param) {
      CVector temp;
      *temp.x = *x + *param.x;
      *temp.y = *y + *param.y;
      return (temp);   
    }

For the original code, where the class has simple integer variables the return by value of the entire class completes successfully. 

 However, after I change the variables to int pointers, the return by value of the class does **not** complete successfully as the integer variables are no longer intact.

 I assume the deconstructor is being called when the temporary CVector goes out of scope and deletes these member integer pointers, but the class itself is still returned by value.

 I'd like to be able to return by value the CVector with the memory allocated to its member variables intact, whilst ensuring the temporary CVector is correctly deleted when it goes out of scope.

 Is there any way this can be done?


Many thanks!

I want the caller to be able to call a public static Chunk class method called **GetNextFilledChunk()**, which

 1. Grabs a Chunk from an inactive chunk pool
 2. Fills the Chunk instance from the input stream using the Chunk's private member variables/functions
 3. Returns a pointer to the Chunk to the caller

But step 2 is giving me fits. No matter what I've tried, trying to get to the Chunk instance's private member variables/functions causes g++ 4.2.1 to emit errors.

    private:
    ...
        ssize_t             m_ActualTextSize;
    };


And here's part of the source file that shows the problem:
    
    #include ""Chunk.h""

        ...

    }
    
As shown, g++ complains that GetNextFilledChunk() is trying to access a private member of Chunk.

Then I thought, maybe it needs to be a ""friend"". But everything I've tried to do in header file to make GetNextFilledChunk() a friend results in an error. For instance:

 friend static Chunk*  GetNextFilledChunk();

results in ""Chunk.h:23: warning: ‘Chunk* GetNextFilledChunk()’ declared ‘static’ but never defined""

What I find truly bizarre is that if I simply make GetNextFilledChunk() a plain old function, not a static member function, I can ""friend"" it and everybody is happy. But that seems silly - why should one be able to do something in a class from a non-class function that can't be done from a static member function?

So... How can Chunk's s GetNextFilledChunk() function access private member variables of a Chunk instance?

""mRNA"" is not matched by:

    QRegExp rxItem(""^\\s{5}(\\w+)"") ;

But is matched by the following:

    QRegExp rxItem(""\\s{4}(\\w+)"") ;


So it looks as if the start of the line and the first space is not being recognised for some reason. I checked-out the Qt documentation for QRegExp and as far as I can tell ""^"" signifies the start of a line and \\s is space as in Perl.

Any ideas?
