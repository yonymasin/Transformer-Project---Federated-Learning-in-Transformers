I just implemented an `@Rule` in some JUnit 4 tests, but when I run them in Eclipse the `MethodRule` methods are not being called. It's like the Eclipse test runner doesn't recognize the `@Rule` implementations and doesn't do anything special with fields that are annotated with `@Rule`.

I even tried using a ""Standard"" MethodRule like `org.junit.rules.TestName` but it doesn't work properly (the test's names are not populated into the instance). Even the example test in the JavaDoc of `TestName` fails when run in Eclipse.

Is there some trick? Does Eclipse simply not support JUnit [Rules][1]?

I need to make sure that the folder ""bin"" is present in the PATH when the product.exe file is executed. Is there a clean way to make sure that the folder ""bin"" is added to PATH when the eclipse RCP product is launched?
I don't want to write any script or batch file that updates the PATH and then calls the product.exe. I also don't want to update the environment variable through the windows UI or command prompt.

Thank you!",eclipse,google-app-engine,gwt,maven,pom,01/13/2012 21:49:54,not a real question,1,4536,9,"How can we make this maven POM.xml more professional? It is the first time we're trying maven with google app engine, google web toolkit (platform, gwtp) and eclipse. We put this up with code we found here and there. We wonder if this POM file can be improved and how, since we're pretty sure it can be improved, particularly, the build section:

  I created a plugin using the ""create plugin with a view"" wizard, which created a tree viewer. The wizard creates the Actions directly in the view, and consequently all parts of the view are visible to the actions. This is fine for simple plugins but not for ""real-world"" plugins, particularly if you need key binding.

  My question is: what is the ""preferred"" way for views and actions to communicate with one another when the Actions are not classes in the View? 

  For example: I have that tree viewer. The user selects various items in the tree, and then right clicks and a menu appears with my Action in it. The user clicks the menu item. That then fires off my Action.  

A) How does the Action get the ""data"" of the selection in that tree viewer, i.e. the underlying objects comprising the tree

b) When the Action runs, I want it to take each selected element, perform some operation, and then update the underlying object and also have the tree's visible appearance change as a result of the operation I've performed... i.e. I want to have the Action communicate back to the tree viewer. Perhaps I want to change the Icon of that selected item's element, for example.  In addition, when the Action starts, I want it to communicate not just with the tree view, but also other visible elements of the view... maybe it should disable certain buttons that otherwise would be visible while the action isnt' running, and then when the Action completes its task I want it to communicate back to the view to update the buttons and maybe increment some counters in some label.

Currently, I have this working, but I know my approach is wrong. The Actions are separate classes, but I'm creating a new instance of them in the View, passing the view into the Action's constructor, and providing getters and setters on the view which the Action calls directly. In addition, since I'm not doing any of this with plugin.xml, I don't get configurable key binding.... just the hard-coded keybindings I've added in the view.

Bottom line is I want to really learn ""the right way"" to do this in Eclipse, not just ""a way that works"". Examples are MOST welcome!

Thanks.",eclipse,,,,,,open,0,382,11,"what is the preferred way for Actions to communicate with views All,
  I created a plugin using the ""create plugin with a view"" wizard, which created a tree viewer. The wizard creates the Actions directly in the view, and consequently all parts of the view are visible to the actions. This is fine for simple plugins but not for ""real-world"" plugins, particularly if you need key binding.

  My question is: what is the ""preferred"" way for views and actions to communicate with one another when the Actions are not classes in the View? 

  For example: I have that tree viewer. The user selects various items in the tree, and then right clicks and a menu appears with my Action in it. The user clicks the menu item. That then fires off my Action.

---

I execute a shell command from Perl and when run from the command line it works, but when run in the debugger it does not work. Running it as a Win32::Daemon shows the same behaviour.

The Source Code
------

I execute a command either with backticks

    print `$cmd`

or like this:

    open FH, ""$cmd |"" or die ""Couldn't execute $cmd: $!\n""; 
    	while(defined(my $line = <FH>)) {
    	    chomp($line);
    	    print ""$line\n"";
    	}
    close FH;

The command reads like this:

    $cmd = '""C:\path\to\sscep.exe"" getca -f ""C:\path\to\config\capi_sscep.cnf""'

Even creating a small test script that just executes this command does only work if run from command line.

The System
-----
- Windows x64
- Active Perl v5.16.0, MSWin32-x64-multi-thread
- Eclipse Juno 20120614-1722

What works
----

I works to open an administrator prompt (necessary for script execution) and to:

    perl script.pl

Output gets printed to screen, `$?` is `0`.

What does not work
-----

Starting Eclipse and running a debug session with the same `perl script.pl` call.
Also not working is adding a service and executing the command (created with Win32::Daemon). The daemon itself is working perfectly fine and starting the perl script as expected. Only the command does not get executed. `$?` is `13568`, no output gets printed.


Further Details
------

The tool I am calling is called _sscep_ and is extended by me. It uses the OpenSSL API and loads the capi engine (Windows CryptoAPI). But the command itself does at least print output before any serious action starts. I can happily provide the source code for this, but I doubt it will help.

I am using Eclipse Indigo on a Fedora 15 laptop.

Here's a very specific question that may be adequately well-focused, and might provide the help I need to tackle the general problem I have.

Eclipse provides a sample plugin named org.eclipse.ui.examples.readmetool, which can be set up from the Help->Welcome page.

This plugin defines an editor named ReadmeEditor.java.  It also defines an extension point ""org.eclipse.ui.popupMenus"" in plugin.xml.  When you use this action from the eclipse Project Explorer view on a file with the suffix "".readme"", you just get a little pop-up window.

How can I change the readmetool plugin so that when you select the above-defined Project Explorer menu item on a foo.readme file, you instead get a new ReadmeEditor in eclipse, with foo.readme in it??

The more specific project need I am struggling with is as follows:

- From the Package Explorer, navigate to a file.

- Right-click the file to get a pop-up context menu

- See a new entry ""Version view""

- On selecting that entry, find the file, run it through an external program to create a temporary file, and display the contents of that temporary file in a new TextEditor window.  (And, don't leave an orphan temporary file around after it is no longer needed.)

I have some of the above pieces in place; I augmented the MultiPageEditor example so that it does the work of running the external program, creating the temporary file, and opening the temporary file in a text editor.

However, the only way I can currently access that functionality is to select the ""Open With"" option in the pop-up context window for the file in the Project Explorer, and go to ""Other"" within that window and select my new editor option.

So, where I am stuck at the moment is how to add the right magic to plugin.xml so that I get a new option on the Project Manager pop-up context window, and connect that with a new TextEditor window.

This seems very much like what the vanilla ""Open"" option would do, and it seems like this should be a pretty basic thing to do within eclipse.  Any examples and/or guidance would be greatly appreciated.

It took two days, largely because all the tutorials I could find were out of date (written in 2008, it's 2010 now) and various steps they included were no longer necessary, broken, or irrelevant. I wanted to write my process here so it could be improved upon (via wiki) as time goes on.

 1. Install Eclipse *without PHP plugin* (""[Eclipse Classic][1]""). This will give you a complete Eclipse, which I find preferable, as the UI is more fleshed out (e.g. you get a default list of Perspectives, which helps you understand what Perspectives are.)

 1. Install PDT SDK with the Help > Install New Software menu item. You'd think you'd be done here, but if you try to run something, it'll fail complaining of not having a debugger.

 1. Install the Zend Debugger. It'll fail if you try to use the Install New Software option, as many tutorials suggest (""No repository found containing osgi.bundle.org.zend.php.debug.debugger.5.3.7.v20091116"".) Instead, download it from http://www.zend.com/en/community/pdt, and manually copy the features/ and plugins/ directory into your Eclipse install (these instructions are not written anywhere).

 1. Restart Eclipse

 1. Monkey with preferences for a while -- if you followed a previous tutorial and tried to manually add your php executable to Eclipse prefs (/usr/bin/php), remove it (PHP > PHP Executables). Set one of the Zend Debugger executables to the default. If you've already tried to execute a .php file, remove the existing ""Run"" profile you (maybe weren't aware that you) created (Run > Debug Configurations...).

 1. Eclipse works! You should be able to run a .php file as a script just fine.

Now i want to output the Logging stuff to a new eclipse console view.

Therefore i wrote my own logging-handler that directly hooks up to an eclipse console:

    public class EclipseConsoleHandler extends StreamHandler
    {

        public EclipseConsoleHandler()
        {
            super(findConsole(""Server Console"").newOutputStream(), new SmartFormatter());
        }
    
        private static final MessageConsole findConsole(String name)
        {
            ConsolePlugin plugin = ConsolePlugin.getDefault();
            IConsoleManager conMan = plugin.getConsoleManager();
            IConsole[] existing = conMan.getConsoles();
            for (int i = 0; i < existing.length; i++)
                if (name.equals(existing[i].getName()))
                    return (MessageConsole)existing [i];
            // no console found, so create a new one
            MessageConsole console = new MessageConsole(name, null);
            conMan.addConsoles(new IConsole[] { console });
            return console;
        }

    }

Now comes the tricky part. We need to configure the java.util.logging framework to use the above handler. In my eclipse plugin-activator i did the following:

    String logConfig = ""handlers = de.d3fact.server.ui.log.EclipseConsoleHandler"";

And this didn't work. During the last call where i try to log the String ""Test"" the java.util.logging framework tries to load the EclipseConsoleHandler through an URLClassLoader. This doesn't work. And results in a ClassNotFoundException.

My assumption is now, that i have to write my own URLClassLoader and hook it up to the Eclipse PluginClassLoader. Is that correct? I couldn't find anything or anyone on the web that/how did this before, though i think it is relative obvious to bring both frameworks together.

Would be nice if anyone could point me into the right direction...",eclipse,console,java.util.logging,,,,open,0,432,13,"Trying to use java.util.logging with Eclipse Console through custom Handler results in ClassNotFoundException I'm using some third party library that makes heavy use of java.util.Logging. Now i want to output the Logging stuff to a new eclipse console view.

Therefore i wrote my own logging-handler that directly hooks up to an eclipse console:

    public class EclipseConsoleHandler extends StreamHandler
    {

        public EclipseConsoleHandler()
        {
            super(findConsole(""Server Console"").newOutputStream(), new SmartFormatter());
        }
    
        private static final MessageConsole findConsole(String name)
        {
            ConsolePlugin plugin = ConsolePlugin.getDefault();
            IConsoleManager conMan = plugin.getConsoleManager();
            IConsole[] existing = conMan.getConsoles();
            for (int i = 0; i < existing.length; i++)
                if (name.equals(existing[i].getName()))
                    return (MessageConsole)existing [i];
            // no console found, so create a new one
            MessageConsole console = new MessageConsole(name, null);
            conMan.addConsoles(new IConsole[] { console });
            return console;
        }

    }

Now comes the tricky part. We need to configure the java.util.logging framework to use the above handler. In my eclipse plugin-activator i did the following:

    String logConfig = ""handlers = de.d3fact.server.ui.log.EclipseConsoleHandler"";
    LogManager.getLogManager().readConfiguration(new ByteArrayInputStream(logConfig.getBytes()));
    Logger.getLogger().severe(""Test"");

    # Cryptography Package Providers (""providers"" for short). The term
    # ""provider"" refers to a package or set of packages that supply a
    # concrete implementation of a subset of the cryptography aspects of
    # the Java Security API. A provider may, for example, implement one or
    # more digital signature algorithms or message digest algorithms.
    #
    # Each provider must implement a subclass of the Provider class.
    # To register a provider in this master security properties file,
    # specify the Provider subclass name and priority in the format
    #
    #    security.provider.<n>=<className>

    # This declares a provider, and specifies its preference
    # order n. The preference order is the order in which providers are

    # requested). The order is 1-based; 1 is the most preferred, followed
    # by 2, and so on.
    #

    # constructor sets the values of various properties that are required
    # for the Java Security API to look up the algorithms or other
    # facilities implemented by the provider.
    #
    # There must be at least one provider specification in java.security.
    # There is a default provider that comes standard with the JDK. It
    # is called the ""SUN"" provider, and its Provider subclass
    # named Sun appears in the sun.security.provider package. Thus, the
    # ""SUN"" provider is registered via the following:
    #
    #    security.provider.1=sun.security.provider.Sun
    #
    # (The number 1 is used for the default provider.)

    # Serial number of the OCSP responder's certificate
    #
    # By default, the certificate of the OCSP responder is that of the issuer

    # Properties to configure OCSP for certificate revocation checking
    #
    
    # Enable OCSP 
    #
    # By default, OCSP is not used for certificate revocation checking.
    # This property enables the use of OCSP when set to the value ""true"".
    #
    # NOTE: SocketPermission is required to connect to an OCSP responder.
    #
    # Example,
    #   ocsp.enable=true
     
    #
    # Location of the OCSP responder
    #
    # By default, the location of the OCSP responder is determined implicitly
    # from the certificate being validated. This property explicitly specifies
    # the location of the OCSP responder. The property is used when the
    # Authority Information Access extension (defined in RFC 3280) is absent
    # from the certificate or when it requires overriding.
    #
    # Example,
    #   ocsp.responderURL=http://ocsp.example.net:80
     
    #
    # Subject name of the OCSP responder's certificate
    #
    # By default, the certificate of the OCSP responder is that of the issuer
    # of the certificate being validated. This property identifies the certificate
    # of the OCSP responder when the default does not apply. Its value is a string 
    # distinguished name (defined in RFC 2253) which identifies a certificate in 
    # the set of certificates supplied during cert path validation. In cases where 
    # the subject name alone is not sufficient to uniquely identify the certificate
    # then both the ""ocsp.responderCertIssuerName"" and
    # ""ocsp.responderCertSerialNumber"" properties must be used instead. When this
    # property is set then those two properties are ignored.
    #
    # Example,
    #   ocsp.responderCertSubjectName=""CN=OCSP Responder, O=XYZ Corp""
    
    #
    # Issuer name of the OCSP responder's certificate
    #
    # By default, the certificate of the OCSP responder is that of the issuer
    # of the certificate being validated. This property identifies the certificate
    # of the OCSP responder when the default does not apply. Its value is a string
    # distinguished name (defined in RFC 2253) which identifies a certificate in

    # property is set then the ""ocsp.responderCertSerialNumber"" property must also 
    # be set. When the ""ocsp.responderCertSubjectName"" property is set then this 
    # property is ignored.
    #
    # Example,
    #   ocsp.responderCertIssuerName=""CN=Enterprise CA, O=XYZ Corp""
     
    #
    # Serial number of the OCSP responder's certificate
    #
    # By default, the certificate of the OCSP responder is that of the issuer
    # of the certificate being validated. This property identifies the certificate
    # of the OCSP responder when the default does not apply. Its value is a string
    # of hexadecimal digits (colon or space separators may be present) which
    # identifies a certificate in the set of certificates supplied during cert path
    # validation. When this property is set then the ""ocsp.responderCertIssuerName""
    # property must also be set. When the ""ocsp.responderCertSubjectName"" property
    # is set then this property is ignored.
    #

A google of the 'White spaces are required between publicId and systemId' error returns many different causes, but I found one that no one else had reported.

I was trying to create a custom Spring 3 XML namespace extension in STS (Eclipse) and that error was driving me nuts.  It turns out that you get this error from the Eclipse XSD/XML validation tools if it can find the schema doc that is specified by the 'xsi:schemaLocation' element.

To add an Eclipse XML Catalog entry go `Window | preferences | XML | XML Catalog` and add an entry.  For `location`, find your project's copy of the XSD and select it.  The `Key Type` should now be `Namespace entry`.  In the `Key` field add the XSD location that you are referencing in your XML file (`http://www.mycompany.com/schema/myns/myns.xsd`).

Once you have added this entry, go back to your XML file and `right-click | validate` - hopefully your error will have vanished and you will have saved yourself a few hours heart-ache too :-)
