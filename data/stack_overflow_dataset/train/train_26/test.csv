at first i couldn't use initWithNibName  function cuz there is no files for Views; all views was in storyboard. Then i figure out how to create files for new views. At tried above code again. It builded but nothing happens; tabcontroller show up not login view.. I'm not sure what am i doing wrong. The main idea i got from other questions' answers is init with tabController and show login view as a modal window. Why are doing that ? Can we init with loginView then if login succeed show the tabBarController? Is it not possible ?

This is my first time on IOS (Objective C) and its not making any sense at all to me. If I load tabController first how can i load user's info who not loged in yet ? I spend 2 full days on this. Anyone have an idea ? (do not forget i'm new on this. Dont be harsh on me :P)

My question is how does the customization work?  My assumption is that we would make a custom build of the app with the appropriate customizations (like branding) and then submit it to apple and only have it distributed to the proper VPP number.  So each custom app would be distributed to one VPP.

Is it also possible, that there is an interconntection between memory leaks, because it occures, that when the pages are diplayed, it sometimes prints a memory warning. For better understanding, i use Instruments on the Simulator to detect leaks, but it couldn't find anything. Only when i test the App on an iPad, it prints this memory leak warnings.

Thanks in advanced,

I tried to modify the navigation bars colors (bordeaux color) both the detailView and the mainWindow but when I change the app orientation I've a color issue in the portrait navigation bar.

In particular, if I start the application in portrait allthing works perfectly and also when  I launch it in landscape mode.

But the problem is when I click in the EVENT button, in portrait mode, in this way:

So when I push the events button and I change the ipad orientation, the left navigation bar return in the default color, so grey!

I would clarify that in the XCODE simulator the problem there isn't, it works perfectly. It's directly on the iPad that the problem appears. Furthermore it's not a code problem and/or a programming error, because I tried to make a blank iPadSplitView application changing only the navigation bars color!

Is there a way to solve this strange problem???

Now the weird thing is even if I remove the code inside the block, basically have the return block from SDWebImageManager do nothing, it still gives the error messages. So it's not related to the loading of the texture or any of those resize functions.

The only thing I can think at the moment is that somehow the SDWebImageManager is changing the Open GL context, or doing something that is interrupting Cocos2d draw calls.

The image loads fine and works, but I get Open GL errors, for a little while after the block kicks in, stuff like this:

    OpenGL error 0x0506 in -[CCSprite draw] 544
    OpenGL error 0x0506 in -[CCSprite draw] 544
    OpenGL error 0x0506 in -[CCTextureAtlas drawNumberOfQuads:fromIndex:] 556
    OpenGL error 0x0506 in -[CCTextureAtlas drawNumberOfQuads:fromIndex:] 556
    OpenGL error 0x0506 in -[CCSprite draw] 544

Now the weird thing is even if I remove the code inside the block, basically have the return block from SDWebImageManager do nothing, it still gives the error messages. So it's not related to the loading of the texture or any of those resize functions.

The only thing I can think at the moment is that somehow the SDWebImageManager is changing the Open GL context, or doing something that is interrupting Cocos2d draw calls.

Adding/removing subviews to/from a UIScrollView causes noticeable lag.

***Details:***

I have a UIScrollView (with paging enabled) that will contain a couple dozen 'pages'.  The content size of this UIScrollview is the number of pages * the width of the scrollview.

Each of these pages is a subview that I build from some file system access.  My scrollview keeps three pages around as subviews: the current page, and its left/right neighbours.  Loading/eviction of the neighbouring subviews takes place when the current page is half offscreen, which is when the disk access and manipulation of view hierarchy occurs.

When I first encountered this my immediate thought was that the disk access/building the subview is the source of the lag.  I've since moved to this an NSTimer, and am still experiencing the same lag.

I'm starting to suspect that the lag is caused by addSubview (adding subview to scrollview) and removeFromSuperview (removing subviews from scrollview).  

Subviews are added directly to UIScrollView.  I don't have a 'content view' inside the UIScrollView that I add them to.

2. By Choosing Leaks when I run the App for Profiling.

Are they supposed to behave differently? or this is a problem with Instruments.

The time I Profile the with Leaks Tool:

In Allocations Graph:
![enter image description here][1]
1. I get lot of Peaks in Graph, The Live bytes and overall bytes are same.
2. I get the Black flags (I think it alarms about memory warning) after 1 minutes usage. Then after a set of flags appearing, my App Crashes. (This happens at times, even when directly run the App in Device)

The time I Profile the with Allocation Tool:

PS: all my projet works fine in the iphone simulator
it's an app, with a tabbar and 4 section, two section are empty yet,
and the two other section are tableview with detail view (data are picked from a plist)
When i test the app on my device, the two empty sections works perfectly, and juste one of the two tableview display the detailview, the second tableview witch works in the simulator did not push the detailview,
what made me mad is that it works fine this morning

A question:
is a plist limited by the data it contain, i mean that if a have a big list for example with 500 dictionary items, can this trouble the good display of the app ?

Thanks

    foo~iphone.png
    foo@2x~iphone.png

I load them with:


    NSString *fileName = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@""foo"" ofType:@""png""];
    UIImage *image = [UIImage imageWithContentsOfFile:fileName];

Experimentally:

On the iPhone, `filename` is `/path/to/bundle/foo~iphone.png`, and on the retina iPhone, it loads the `@2x` version.

On the iPad, `filename` is `/path/to/bundle/foo~ipad.png`, and on the retina iPad, it loads the `@2x` version.

That is, it loads the image I'd hope, but `pathForResource` handles the device modifier, and `imageWithContentsOfFile` handles the scale modifier.

I'd like to know why. The [documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSBundle_Class/Reference/Reference.html) of `pathForResource` says nothing about device modifiers, and the [documentation](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/uikit/reference/UIImage_Class/Reference/Reference.html) of `imageWithContentsOfFile` says nothing about scale modifiers.

There is also a default.properties file:

    # default properties
    sdk.version         = 5.1
    app.title           = <APP_NAME>
    app.subtitle        = <APP_NAME>
    config.simulator    = Debug
    config.device       = Release
    target.app          = <APP_NAME>
    target.unittests    = <APP_NAME>Test
    provisioningprofile = <APP_NAME>AdHoc.mobileprovision
    codesign            = iPhone Distribution: <COMPANY_NAME>
    icon.small          = Icon.png
    icon.large          = Icon@2x.png
    OTAURL              = http://<COMPANY_NAME>.com/OTA/<APP_NAME>

When I run

    ant distribute

on my local machine (not even on the CI server), the following error occurs:

    [exec] error: Specified application doesn't exist or isn't a bundle directory : '/Users/<MY_USERNAME>/Documents/<COMPANY_NAME>/projects/<APP_NAME>/build/Release-iphoneos/<APP_NAME>.app'

I did a lot of researching the last days. But now, I don't, what else to do ...

What I got so far:

1. Since Xcode 4, the build path is no longer your project directory, but instead a unique folder in the user library. The settings for this can be found under ""Derived Data"".
""Legacy"" is the project folder and ""unique"" (the new default setting) is the user library.

2. The dependency of ""distribute"" is ""devicebuild"". That target uses the unique folder and correctly creates it under

    /Users/<MY_USERNAME>/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData

3. On the other side (in the target ""distribute"") the only line I need to change is

    < arg line=""-v '${app.path}'"" />

which points to the local / project directory.

Instead of the app.path I need to set the unique folder (user library).

4. In [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6910901/canonical-list-of-xcode-environment-variables][1] I found a list of Xcode environment variables. The 

    BUILD_DIR

variable is close to what I need. It's a bit deeper in the folder hierarchy, but ok.

5. I thought, perhaps is [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8536728/xcrun-packageapplication-failed-unable-to-copy-application][2] a similar problems. But it's not really the same.

Even though BUILD_DIR is not absolutely correct, I tried to use that one. But I did not succeed in that.

How do I call that Xcode env variable in my ant script? Is that even possible?

I tried:

    < arg line=""-v '${BUILD_DIR}'"" />
    < arg line=""-v '$BUILD_DIR'"" />
    < arg line=""-v 'BUILD_DIR'"" />

Please, tell me which stupid mistake I did without knowing it. :-)

Really big thanks in advance!
And if you need more information (even thought I don't think, there is much left I did not tell you), just ask.

Greetings and have a nice day,
Dominic

",ios,xcode,ant,build,jenkins,,open,0,3813,10,"[ios][ant][xcode][jenkins] Unique Xcode BUILD_PATH environment variable in build.xml not usable I have a problem with our ant script / Jenkins since using CocoaPods (which I think is not the real cause for the problem, it's more a class of problems), which turned the Xcode project in a Xcode workspace.

We use Jenkins for the OTA (over the air) distribution.

When I run

    ant distribute

on my local machine (not even on the CI server), the following error occurs:

    [exec] error: Specified application doesn't exist or isn't a bundle directory : '/Users/<MY_USERNAME>/Documents/<COMPANY_NAME>/projects/<APP_NAME>/build/Release-iphoneos/<APP_NAME>.app'

I did a lot of researching the last days. But now, I don't, what else to do ...

What I got so far:

1. Since Xcode 4, the build path is no longer your project directory, but instead a unique folder in the user library. The settings for this can be found under ""Derived Data"".
""Legacy"" is the project folder and ""unique"" (the new default setting) is the user library.

2. The dependency of ""distribute"" is ""devicebuild"". That target uses the unique folder and correctly creates it under

    /Users/<MY_USERNAME>/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData

3. On the other side (in the target ""distribute"") the only line I need to change is

    < arg line=""-v '${app.path}'"" />

which points to the local / project directory.

Instead of the app.path I need to set the unique folder (user library).

4. In [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6910901/canonical-list-of-xcode-environment-variables][1] I found a list of Xcode environment variables. The 

    BUILD_DIR

variable is close to what I need. It's a bit deeper in the folder hierarchy, but ok.

5. I thought, perhaps is [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8536728/xcrun-packageapplication-failed-unable-to-copy-application][2] a similar problems. But it's not really the same.

Even though BUILD_DIR is not absolutely correct, I tried to use that one. But I did not succeed in that.

How do I call that Xcode env variable in my ant script? Is that even possible?

I tried:

    < arg line=""-v '${BUILD_DIR}'"" />
    < arg line=""-v '$BUILD_DIR'"" />
    < arg line=""-v 'BUILD_DIR'"" />

Please, tell me which stupid mistake I did without knowing it. :-)

Really big thanks in advance!
And if you need more information (even thought I don't think, there is much left I did not tell you), just ask.

Greetings and have a nice day,
Dominic

For the last six months I am exploring/learning/developing iOS apps with [Titanium Appcelerator][1] mobile framework. My experiences are mostly good or very good.

**Some negative parts** of Titanium would be building time, especially when testing on a device. When using only Xcode (native), your app starts immediately on a device, while with Titanium you have to wait for a while (1-2 minutes) for your app to build and then to install it on a device (iTunes or iPhone Configuration Utility). 

Basically everything that you can do natively you can do with Javascript + Titanium. If Titanium does not support some part of iOS framework, you can build a native Objective-C module and have those features in your Javascript code.

I feel really comfortable now using Titanium Appcelerator and building apps with Javascript. Also I learned some Objective-C while building a few modules for iOS. Eg. [DeviceMotion][2] which I used in my first iOS app [Spellery][3].

**Now the question**:

Most companies wants only native developers and are sceptic of Titanium. Titanium is different from other cross platform SDKs (Eg. PhoneGap) because here you actually use native components (buttons, labels etc) and your app is not running in a WebView. But if company wants native then you can't force them to use Titanium.

Since I would like to develop mobile apps as a job, should I just throw my last six months of intensive exploring of Titanium and learn programming those apps natively?

What are your thoughts on this because I see no point in learning/perfecting both of them?

I am a very big fan of Appcelerator Titanium now so this is a very heavy decision to make.

 UsingTable.m

>        - (UITableViewCell *)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView cellForRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath
     {
    static NSString *CellIdentifier = @""Cell"";
     CustomCell *cell = [tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier:CellIdentifier];
    if (cell == nil) {
        cell = [[[CustomCell alloc] initWithStyle:UITableViewCellStyleDefault   reuseIdentifier:CellIdentifier] autorelease];
           cell.tingo = [NSString stringWithFormat:@""picsButtonImg.png""];
         cell.iconName.text = @""d"";
    } 
    return cell;
       }


So the label shows ok , but the image doesn't show, I have tried with sending an uiImage and an NSString, 

what is missing? thanks!",3

I am trying to write an OpenGL renderbuffer to a video on the iPad 2 (using iOS 4.3). This is more exactly what I am attempting:

A) set up an AVAssetWriterInputPixelBufferAdaptor

1. create an AVAssetWriter that points to a video file

2. set up an AVAssetWriterInput with appropriate settings

3. set up an AVAssetWriterInputPixelBufferAdaptor to add data to the video file


B) write data to a video file using that AVAssetWriterInputPixelBufferAdaptor

1. render OpenGL code to the screen

2. get the OpenGL buffer via glReadPixels

3. create a CVPixelBufferRef from the OpenGL data

4. append that PixelBuffer to the AVAssetWriterInputPixelBufferAdaptor using the appendPixelBuffer method

However, I am having problems doings this. My strategy right now is to set up the AVAssetWriterInputPixelBufferAdaptor when a button is pressed. Once the AVAssetWriterInputPixelBufferAdaptor is valid, I set a flag to signal the EAGLView to create a pixel buffer and append it to the video file via appendPixelBuffer for a given number of frames.

Right now my code is crashing as it tries to append the second pixel buffer, giving me the following error: 

    -[__NSCFDictionary appendPixelBuffer:withPresentationTime:]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x131db0

Here is my AVAsset setup code (a lot of was based on Rudy Aramayo's code, which *does* work on normal images, but is not set up for textures):

    - (void) testVideoWriter {
     
      //initialize global info
      MOVIE_NAME = @""Documents/Movie.mov"";

      currentTime = kCMTimeZero;
      currentFrame = 0;

      NSError *error = nil;
      
      unlink([betaCompressionDirectory UTF8String]);
      
      videoWriter = [[AVAssetWriter alloc] initWithURL:[NSURL fileURLWithPath:betaCompressionDirectory] fileType:AVFileTypeQuickTimeMovie error:&error];
      
      NSDictionary *videoSettings = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys:AVVideoCodecH264, AVVideoCodecKey,
                                     [NSNumber numberWithInt:size.width], AVVideoWidthKey,
                                     [NSNumber numberWithInt:size.height], AVVideoHeightKey, nil];
      writerInput = [AVAssetWriterInput assetWriterInputWithMediaType:AVMediaTypeVideo outputSettings:videoSettings];
      
      //writerInput.expectsMediaDataInRealTime = NO;
      
      NSDictionary *sourcePixelBufferAttributesDictionary = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys: [NSNumber numberWithInt:kCVPixelFormatType_32BGRA], kCVPixelBufferPixelFormatTypeKey, nil];
      
      adaptor = [AVAssetWriterInputPixelBufferAdaptor assetWriterInputPixelBufferAdaptorWithAssetWriterInput:writerInput                                                                          sourcePixelBufferAttributes:sourcePixelBufferAttributesDictionary];

    }


Ok, now that my videoWriter and adaptor are set up, I tell my OpenGL renderer to create a pixel buffer for every frame:

        return;
      }

                                    }
                                  }];
      [library release];
    }

 
However, as I said, I am crashing in the call to appendPixelBuffer.

Sorry for sending so much code, but I really don't know what I am doing wrong. It seemed like it would be trivial to update a project which writes images to a video, but I am unable to take the pixel buffer I create via glReadPixels and append it. It's driving me crazy! If anyone has any advice or a working code example of OpenGL --> Video that would be amazing... Thanks!",ios,video,xcode4,opengl-es-2.0,avassetwriter,,open,0,1330,7,"OpenGL ES 2.0 to Video on iPad/iPhone I am at my wits end here despite the good information here on StackOverflow...

I am trying to write an OpenGL renderbuffer to a video on the iPad 2 (using iOS 4.3). This is more exactly what I am attempting:

A) set up an AVAssetWriterInputPixelBufferAdaptor

1. create an AVAssetWriter that points to a video file

2. set up an AVAssetWriterInput with appropriate settings

3. set up an AVAssetWriterInputPixelBufferAdaptor to add data to the video file


B) write data to a video file using that AVAssetWriterInputPixelBufferAdaptor

1. render OpenGL code to the screen

2. get the OpenGL buffer via glReadPixels

3. create a CVPixelBufferRef from the OpenGL data

4. append that PixelBuffer to the AVAssetWriterInputPixelBufferAdaptor using the appendPixelBuffer method

However, I am having problems doings this. My strategy right now is to set up the AVAssetWriterInputPixelBufferAdaptor when a button is pressed. Once the AVAssetWriterInputPixelBufferAdaptor is valid, I set a flag to signal the EAGLView to create a pixel buffer and append it to the video file via appendPixelBuffer for a given number of frames.

Right now my code is crashing as it tries to append the second pixel buffer, giving me the following error: 

    -[__NSCFDictionary appendPixelBuffer:withPresentationTime:]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x131db0

Here is my AVAsset setup code (a lot of was based on Rudy Aramayo's code, which *does* work on normal images, but is not set up for textures):

    - (void) testVideoWriter {
     
      //initialize global info
      MOVIE_NAME = @""Documents/Movie.mov"";
      CGSize size = CGSizeMake(480, 320);
      frameLength = CMTimeMake(1, 5); 
      currentTime = kCMTimeZero;
      currentFrame = 0;
      
      NSString *MOVIE_PATH = [NSHomeDirectory() stringByAppendingPathComponent:MOVIE_NAME];
      NSError *error = nil;
      
      unlink([betaCompressionDirectory UTF8String]);
      
      videoWriter = [[AVAssetWriter alloc] initWithURL:[NSURL fileURLWithPath:betaCompressionDirectory] fileType:AVFileTypeQuickTimeMovie error:&error];
      
      NSDictionary *videoSettings = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys:AVVideoCodecH264, AVVideoCodecKey,
                                     [NSNumber numberWithInt:size.width], AVVideoWidthKey,
                                     [NSNumber numberWithInt:size.height], AVVideoHeightKey, nil];
      writerInput = [AVAssetWriterInput assetWriterInputWithMediaType:AVMediaTypeVideo outputSettings:videoSettings];
      
      //writerInput.expectsMediaDataInRealTime = NO;
      
      NSDictionary *sourcePixelBufferAttributesDictionary = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys: [NSNumber numberWithInt:kCVPixelFormatType_32BGRA], kCVPixelBufferPixelFormatTypeKey, nil];
      
      adaptor = [AVAssetWriterInputPixelBufferAdaptor assetWriterInputPixelBufferAdaptorWithAssetWriterInput:writerInput                                                                          sourcePixelBufferAttributes:sourcePixelBufferAttributesDictionary];
      
            
      [videoWriter addInput:writerInput];
      
      [videoWriter startWriting];
      [videoWriter startSessionAtSourceTime:kCMTimeZero];
      
      VIDEO_WRITER_IS_READY = true;
    }


Ok, now that my videoWriter and adaptor are set up, I tell my OpenGL renderer to create a pixel buffer for every frame:

    - (void) captureScreenVideo {
      
      if (!writerInput.readyForMoreMediaData) {
        return;
      }
      
      CGSize esize = CGSizeMake(eagl.backingWidth, eagl.backingHeight);
      NSInteger myDataLength = esize.width * esize.height * 4;
      GLuint *buffer = (GLuint *) malloc(myDataLength);
      glReadPixels(0, 0, esize.width, esize.height, GL_RGBA, GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, buffer);
      CVPixelBufferRef pixel_buffer = NULL;
      CVPixelBufferCreateWithBytes (NULL, esize.width, esize.height, kCVPixelFormatType_32BGRA, buffer, 4 * esize.width, NULL, 0, NULL, &pixel_buffer);
      free(buffer);
      
      if(![adaptor appendPixelBuffer:pixel_buffer withPresentationTime:currentTime]) {
          NSLog(@""FAIL"");
        } else {
          NSLog(@""Success:%d"", currentFrame);
          currentTime = CMTimeAdd(currentTime, frameLength);
        }
         
        
       CVPixelBufferRelease(pixel_buffer);
       CFRelease(pixel_buffer);
      }
      
      
      currentFrame++;
      
      if (currentFrame > MAX_FRAMES) {
        VIDEO_WRITER_IS_READY = false;
        [writerInput markAsFinished];
        [videoWriter finishWriting];
        [videoWriter release];
       
        [self moveVideoToSavedPhotos]; 
      }
    }

And finally, I move the Video to the camera roll:

    - (void) moveVideoToSavedPhotos {
      ALAssetsLibrary *library = [[ALAssetsLibrary alloc] init];
      NSString *localVid = [NSHomeDirectory() stringByAppendingPathComponent:MOVIE_NAME];    
      NSURL* fileURL = [NSURL fileURLWithPath:localVid];
      
      [library writeVideoAtPathToSavedPhotosAlbum:fileURL
                                  completionBlock:^(NSURL *assetURL, NSError *error) {
                                    if (error) {   
                                      NSLog(@""%@: Error saving context: %@"", [self class], [error localizedDescription]);
                                    }
                                  }];
      [library release];
    }

In the receiver, I get the url and load the RTF file in the UIWebView using

    - (void) loadContent: (NSURL *) passedURL
    {
        if (passedURL) { 
            [self.myWebView loadRequest:[NSURLRequest requestWithURL:passedURL]];
        } else {
            NSBundle *bundle = [NSBundle mainBundle];
            NSURL *indexFileURL = [bundle URLForResource:@""index"" withExtension:@""html""];
            [self.myWebView loadRequest:[NSURLRequest requestWithURL:indexFileURL]];
        
        }
    }

Doing that, everything goes all right, and ""myWebView"" displays the content of the RTF file. The problem is that this view should be content editable, and the code should contain some javascript that I have in my ""index.html"" bundled file. I load when starting application. So I added some code to extract the HTML code created from the RTF file to be able later to recreate a complete code, inserting the extracted code in a <div> tag like that:

    <div id=""content"" contenteditable=""true""> imported html from rtf should be there</div>

I modified the loadContent method to get that.

    - (void) loadContent: (NSURL *) passedURL
    {
        if (passedURL) { 
            [self.myWebView loadRequest:[NSURLRequest requestWithURL:passedURL]];
            NSString *dum=[self.myWebView stringByEvaluatingJavaScriptFromString:@""document.body.innerHTML;""];
            NSLog(@""%@"",dum);
        } else {
            NSBundle *bundle = [NSBundle mainBundle];
            NSURL *indexFileURL = [bundle URLForResource:@""index"" withExtension:@""html""];
            [self.myWebView loadRequest:[NSURLRequest requestWithURL:indexFileURL]];
        
        }
    }
 
Looking to the result of the NSLog, I get only the following html

    <div id=""content"" contenteditable=""true"">Hello folks</div>

Which was the HTML content of myWebView **BEFORE** I loaded the rtf file...

Do you have any idea of what is going on? Why does *dum* displays the former code, as the displayed myWebView displays the new one? Is it because the loadRequest is executed in a separated thread and that when executing the next instruction, myWebView still contains the former code?

Thanks

What I want to achieve, is that exact match(es) shows only matched words, and words coming after it (my arrays are strictly alphabetically ordered), show in additional results, but all I get is that it shows either same results in both sections, or it shows several results in exact matches, whereas it shows only one result (which is alike the first match in the first section) in additional results.

Sorry for messy codes, please point me in right direction, thank you.


Merry Christmas!",5
