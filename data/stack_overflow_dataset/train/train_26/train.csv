            if (![self.view pointInside:[self.view convertPoint:location fromView:self.view.window] withEvent:nil]) 
            {
                [self dismissModalViewControllerAnimated:YES];
                NSLog(@""There are %d Gesture Recognizers"",[self.view.window gestureRecognizers].count);
                [self.view.window removeGestureRecognizer:sender];
            }
        }
    }

This works amazing for dismissing a single modal view. Now suppose I have two modal views, one called from within the root view controller (View A) and then another modal called from within the first modal (View B)

Kind of like this:

Root View -> View A -> View B

When I tap to dismiss View B, all is well. However I get an `EXC_BAD_ACCESS` error when I try to dismiss View A. After turning on zombies, it seems that View B is still getting the message `handleTapBehind:` sent to it, even though it's been dismissed and out of memory after View B was closed.

My question is why is View B still being messaged? (`handleTapBehind:` make sure that gesture recognizer should have been removed from the associated window.) And how can I get it to be sent to View A after View B is already dismissed.

PS. The code above appears both inside the controller for View A and for View B, and it is identical.",5

So across my applications I've used SQLite directly with no wrapper, and I didn't really enjoy interacting directly with the C functions within my lovely OO app.

Then I decided to learn Core Data for two reasons, firstly I wanted to familiarise myself with this framework as it is a very useful and present framework within the iOS developing environment and in terms of my career I wanted to ensure that I knew this framework, but also at a first glance it seemed like the perfect solution for my application.

In a nut shell it was an app where the user generated their own content, so creating data sets based on user interaction was quite satisfyingly achieved with Core Data, but then another layer got added to my application which was some sort of remote API sync, so now I had an remote API endpoint that could tell me some data from other users, then I had to save this to the app and refresh, update etc from the remote source from time to time, but as soon as I started integrating the concept of downloading batches of data from the remote source, I realised that Core Data wasn't really as great as I hoped, so for example my application needed a login and then I would load your friends data from the remote source (based on Facebook friends using this application). So when I log out from the application, I would have to pass on all the objects in the Core Data store and delete them, because assuming the next login is by a different user, you wouldn't want to show that user the previous users friends information.

There was one feature of Core Data I loved and that was the Fetched Results Controller for table views, this worked great and optimised to the max the object faulting etc...

However the problem still remained about the remote sync, downloading batches of data and saving then one by one, the deleting them to keep up to date, seemed like a lot of looping, loading and operations, especially when you consider that this would only be one SQL command to delete all the records of your friends if I had chosen SQLite for this...

So my question is, according to you what are the optimal contexts when Core Data should be preferred to SQLite and vice versa, to kick off and I'm still trying to really figure tho one out, I made a short list of apps and what I think they use:

• FaceTime for mac: it seems the data store for all the calls / missed calls, call duration, favourites, would be Core Data.

• Twitter iOS app: given the enormous set of data that a user could have in this app, I an guessing that it uses SQLite, however I could be wrong...

It seems to me that you would consider Core Data more in a user content generation scenario, and an SQLite solution in a more large set/remote data sync scenario, but sometimes these two scenarios come together in the same application, I do know of some developers mixing and matching both in the same application but I would like to get your take on this, and could anyone say for any particular apps they know one or the other is being used, as a matter of curiosity.

I would like to save the data generated in the loop in a global NSMutableArray that I created called ""companyAddress""
I tried with

    [_companyAddress addObject:[row objectAtIndex:1]];

or

    [_companyName addObject:_company.address];

when I try to print on the screen the contents of _companyAddress it just outputs the last line contained from ""_company.address"" so I suppose the data in the NSMutableArray is overwritten for each loop instead of being added.

Can anyone tell me if there is any way to add data properly?

The GEOimage chosenImage is created via the CGImageRef after an UIImage is chosen in the ImagePickerController. 
Method nr. *1 to get the NSData for upload is not the best, because here the image is chosen from the document directory, and here every EXIF information about the image is deleted.
With both methods i get the response from the database that the image filetype is not supported (JPEG expected). 
I thought with method nr. *2 i'm sending an JPEG image, but perhaps i have a mistake in the whole multipart/formdata process.

I tried to get the URL to the original file on the filesystem, but this is quite difficult for me. I only got the assets-url from the image.

Thanks in advance

The GEOimage chosenImage is created via the CGImageRef after an UIImage is chosen in the ImagePickerController. 
Method nr. *1 to get the NSData for upload is not the best, because here the image is chosen from the document directory, and here every EXIF information about the image is deleted.
With both methods i get the response from the database that the image filetype is not supported (JPEG expected). 
I thought with method nr. *2 i'm sending an JPEG image, but perhaps i have a mistake in the whole multipart/formdata process.

I tried to get the URL to the original file on the filesystem, but this is quite difficult for me. I only got the assets-url from the image.

Thanks in advance

At a later point, I am parsing the same XML, though some of it *may* have been updated. What I then do is check for an existing record with the same tag and if one already exist, I update the record with the data.

However, while my initial parsing (about 11.000 records) takes 8 seconds or so, updating seems expensive and takes 144 seconds (these are Simulator runs, so significantly longer on actual devices).

While the first time is fine (I'm showing a progress bar), the second is unacceptably long, and I would like to do something to improve the speed (even though it happens in the background on a separate thread).

Unfortunately it's not a matter of [find-or-create][1] as the data in the XML may have changed for individual records, so each could essentially need an update.

I've indexes the attributes, which sped up the initial parsing and the updating as well, but it's still slow (numbers above are with indexing). What I have noticed it that the parsing/updating seems to slow down gradually. While initially fast, it gets slower and slower as more and more records are dealt with.

So finally my question is if anything has any suggestions for me for how I could improve the speed at which I am updating my dataset? I am using MagicalRecord for fetching the record. Here's the code:

I am attempting to monitor a directory with potentially thousands of files in it and I do not want to call stat on every one of them to find out which ones changed. I also do not want to set up a separate dispatch source for every file in that directory. Is this currently possible?

Note: I have documented my experiments monitoring files with [kqueue](http://www.davidhamrick.com/2011/10/09/kqueue-in-cocoa.html) and [GCD](http://www.davidhamrick.com/2011/10/10/handling-filesystem-events-with-gcd.html)",3

But it turns out that, it seems every 1/60 of a second, the whole tree is just traversed. Starting from the top view object, iOS will visit all the children, and then call `drawRect` for `self`, and the children are also visited the same way, that the grandchildren are visited, and `drawRect` is called for each those first level children, as in:

    -(void) processViewObject:(UIView *) obj {
        // pseudo code:
        foreach children ""c"" already sorted by zOrder from most negative to -1
            processViewObject(c)    // recursion
    
        if ([self needsUpdateOrNot] == YES)
            [self drawRect]
    
        foreach children ""c"" already sorted by zOrder from 1 to greatest number
            processViewObject(c)   // recursion

and a call is made every 1/60 second, for

    processViewObject(topViewObject);

So that any view can draw itself in `drawRect`, and the view's children, if the coordinate is modified, or if their content is changed, then the dirty bit `needsUpdateOrNot` will be set, so that next time when the 1/60 second event kicks in, the `drawRect` will be called if the dirty bit `needsUpdateOrNot` is set.

Or actually, if a view's dirty bit is set, then probably this bit will be pass to the children in the recursion, as in:

        foreach children ""c"" already sorted by zOrder from 1 to greatest number
            processViewObject(c, [self needsUpdateOrNot])

so that if the parent's dirty bit is set, then the children will also need to be redrawn, for the whole picture inside this view to be drawn correctly.

Is this how the overall mechanism of how everything is drawn on the screen?  I hear of ""never call `drawRect` ourselves, but let it be called"", but never fully understand why, but if the above is the overall mechanism, then it looks like that's the reason why.

I wonder if this is the same mechanism that actually is almost the same as on Microsoft Windows or any GUI operating system, and on some game frameworks, I think no matter whether the dirty bit is set or not, everything is drawn because supposedly, things in a game move all the time, and the framework just draw all of them regardless every 1/60 of a second anyway.

The `zOrder` processing order above was in some framework's code, so that all the negative zOrder children are drawn first, and then `self` is drawn, and then all positive zOrder children are drawn.  So `self` is a zOrder of `0` if relative to the children -- the zOrder number of `self` matters if it is relative to its own siblings, not relative to its children.

Is the above accurate?  If giving an answer, if possibly, can part of the source code or reference be quoted, so that we know that is the standard or official way of how it works?

The basic requirements are:

 1. Code reuse - I have several view elements that are common across multiple views and would like to be able to have changes to the same XIB affect those uniformly.
 2. Interface Builder design - I find the layout easier to work with in the interface builder as opposed to written in code.
 3. Clean code base - I don't want to have a bunch of classes all trying to accomplish a simple task.

In attempting to just lay the views out in code, I have found it a tedious process to debug and deal with tweaking the view to how I want it.  But when reading [this post][2] about instantiating subviews from XIB files, it seems like there should be a better way to do it.  In that solution, one must create an XIB, then a .h/.m file to manage the outlets for that custom view, and then must also add a .h/.m file for the container for that view; only then does the container actually get placed as a subview of your master screen.

This seems like code bloat to me.  We have created 5 files all to deal with a simple subview with some outlets.  Is the container class that wraps the custom UIView really necessary?  I would like to be able to just throw a UIView subview into my XIB layout, designate its class as my subview, and then move on.

What is the best design pattern to use?  Is is really necessary to have the overhead (both computational and coding) of the extra container, or is there a way I don't know of to bypass that container and add the custom view with outlets directly as a subview within an XIB?

I know what you may all say, and frankly, seeing all these answers on the Internet, saying about the bad aspects of singletons, and advising against them really made me question my programming practices.

I have already read some posts in StackOverflow regarding Singletons, but I post this question not only to ask about them, but to see some insights about the way I use them in my programs.
 
I feel I must really clarify some things here and ask fore directions.
 
So lets consider some cases where I use singletons a lot:
 
1) To create accessors to global variables, like my root view controller, specific and always existing view controllers, application state, my global managed object context... stuff like that
2) To create utility classes whose job is to handle data application-wide. For example, I create a Singleton that will operate my caching database, which relies on Core Data. Since I need to create caches and other stuff to be put in the database in different views, it somehow felt better to create a class that will handle database ins/outs (being careful about thread safety).
3) Handling network sessions. Actually, I use it to keep alive a connection and sending something like a PINg to a server each XX seconds.
 
I think that about sums it up. I would really like opinions from other developers on the matter.
Do you think that there are better solutions for these problems above?

It took me a while to figure out how to make it run smoothly, but I found that by wrapping relevant objects in a container UIView, and setting the container's layer.shouldRasterize to YES, but leave that property of all the contained views set to NO, it will run buttery smooth no matter how elaborate your blending may be.

It's basically like this:


UIScrollView
***
Container View (layer.shouldRasterize = YES)

   - child (layer.shouldRasterize = NO)
     - childOfChild (layer.shouldRasterize = NO)
   - child (layer.shouldRasterize = NO)

Basically, the container ends up as one big block image when it rasterizes, minimizing the amount of rasterization that has to be done. However, this has created a new problem for me. If I have several containers in a UIScrollView, as soon as one of the containers gets scrolled offscreen, it gets tagged ""Red"" in the CoreAnimation profiler, and therefore must be rendered again when it is scrolled back onscreen. This causes a brief stutter. I don't understand why the container's layer has to rasterize all over again. Can anyone explain this or perhaps provide a workaround?

I put this here on SO because the problems are also about building apps, signing them etc. So I thought it would fit best here, especially because of the knowledge of developers who have gone through the various processes of app distribution.

Here's my knowledge. Can somebody please correct the wrong points or confirm correct ones?

 1. With the standard developer license, apps can only be deployed through Apple's App Store. Apps have to pass a review.
 2. The standard license allows to deploy to up to 100 devices per year for testing purposes. The app must be signed with a certificate/profile that contains all the devices IDs the app is going to be installed on. It will not be possible to install on other devices. If a new device is added, the app has to be rebuilt/resigned with an updated profile. The app does not have to be reviewed.
 3. The In-house distribution license allows installation on up to 1000 (?) devices of the license owner's company. It is illegal to give the app to third party iOS users. Publishing through Apple's store is not supported. The app does not need to be reviewed by Apple. What is totally unclear in this context: how is that manageable? If a new employee wants to install the app on his iPhone, does the app have to be rebuild and signed with a profile that includes the new device ID? Or does the new employee need some profile installed on his device? How exactly does that work?
 4. If a company wants to build an app exclusively for B2B, what options are there? It does not make sense to put it in the official App Store. Is there the possibility of a separate ""Sub-App-Store""?

Publishing through Apple's store is not supported. The app does not need to be reviewed by Apple. What is totally unclear in this context: how is that manageable? If a new employee wants to install the app on his iPhone, does the app have to be rebuild and signed with a profile that includes the new device ID? Or does the new employee need some profile installed on his device? How exactly does that work?
 4. If a company wants to build an app exclusively for B2B, what options are there? It does not make sense to put it in the official App Store. Is there the possibility of a separate ""Sub-App-Store""? 
 5. To my knowledge there is no way to distribute an app without any restrictions wrt number of devices without going through App Store. Correct?",4

I want the used to be able to zoom in out of the image since it's a big image. the scrollview only needs to scroll vertically not horizontally. 

before adding the zooming effect I had the following code and it worked as I wanted,

    -(void)viewDidLoad
    {
    [scrollView setScrollEnabled:YES];
	[scrollView setContentSize:CGSizeMake(320, 1690)];

So I did some research and ended up with the following code to enable pinch zoom in and out,

    [scrollView setContentSize:CGSizeMake(320, 1690)];

    //    scrollView.contentSize = instImage.frame.size;
    scrollView.minimumZoomScale = scrollView.frame.size.width / instImage.frame.size.width;
    scrollView.maximumZoomScale = 2.0;
    [scrollView setZoomScale:scrollView.minimumZoomScale];
    [[NSRunLoop currentRunLoop] runMode:NSRunLoopCommonModes beforeDate:[NSDate distantFuture]];
 
     }


     - (UIView *)viewForZoomingInScrollView:(UIScrollView *)scrollView {
    
    return instImage;
    }


     - (CGRect)centeredFrameForScrollView:(UIScrollView *)scroll andUIView:(UIView *)rView {
  
    CGSize boundsSize = scroll.bounds.size;
    CGRect frameToCenter = rView.frame;
    
    // center horizontally
    if (frameToCenter.size.width < boundsSize.width) {
                
        frameToCenter.origin.x = ((boundsSize.width - frameToCenter.size.width) / 2);
    
    }else {

     - (void)scrollViewDidZoom:(UIScrollView *)scrollV {
    
    instImage.frame = [self centeredFrameForScrollView:scrollV andUIView:instImage];;
     }


Now I have the following problems and I can't figure out what's wrong,

1. when the view is just loaded before any pinch the scrollview doesn't scroll all the way to the end of the image.

2. when pinched to zoom in, it scrolls left and right and up and down the image, but still it doesn't scroll down all the way to the end of the image, but still more than what it originally did at the begining. 

3. when I zoom out, the whole thing stops. you can't zoom in or out, it doesn't even scroll anymore. totally locked. 

I did some reseach and found the following post.

I primarily do client-side application development. While I sincerely enjoy the platform, I'm incredibly distraught with Microsoft's poor performance in the mobile and tablet space. I was very confident that Silverlight was going to be THE platform that Microsoft would commit to. I spent a lot of time learning it and working with it. But now, I really feel like MS has stabbed their loyal devs in the back with the messaging around Windows 8. I have lost my confidence in not just Silverlight, but Microsoft in general. As Scott Hanselman said, JavaScript is the assembly language for the web. Frankly, I didn't care for assembly when i did it in school. And even if there is a SL to JS compiler, SL will get devalued. Why do I want to help Microsoft succeed if they don't want to help me succeed?

As a developer, the iOS platform has raised a lot of curiosity. Are there any developers out there that can communicate their experience in regards to:

Thank you",ios,silverlight,microsoft,,,07/22/2011 19:03:39,off topic,1,199,9,".NET to iOS - Thinking of changing my career I have been working with .NET since 2003. I primarily do client-side application development. While I sincerely enjoy the platform, I'm incredibly distraught with Microsoft's poor performance in the mobile and tablet space. I was very confident that Silverlight was going to be THE platform that Microsoft would commit to. I spent a lot of time learning it and working with it. But now, I really feel like MS has stabbed their loyal devs in the back with the messaging around Windows 8. I have lost my confidence in not just Silverlight, but Microsoft in general. As Scott Hanselman said, JavaScript is the assembly language for the web. Frankly, I didn't care for assembly when i did it in school. And even if there is a SL to JS compiler, SL will get devalued. Why do I want to help Microsoft succeed if they don't want to help me succeed?

As a developer, the iOS platform has raised a lot of curiosity. Are there any developers out there that can communicate their experience in regards to:

My company develops an iOS app for company A. Only employees of company A use this app and it must not appear in the Apple app store. Customer A pays us for developing the app, but the app itself is free. 

**The problem:**
How do we distribute the app and updates to the employees (>100, ad-hoc not an option) of company A?

**How the perfect solution should look like:**
Like distribution through the app store: Company A doesn't need to do anything and the users can acquire/update the app easily and quickly.


**Notes**
Customer A wants to do as little as possible. They also don't really care about costs.




**My ideas so far, please let me know what you think about them (and feel free to add your own)**

 1. My company applies for the iOS Enterprise Developer program (EDP) and puts the app on our own, login-protected website. Customer A doesn't need to do anything and its employees can simply download the app from the website. 

 2. Like 1., but customer A applies for the iOS EDP 


The first method would be perfect, but according to [this thread][1] it might be dangerous. Though I highly doubt Apple would press legal charges (Free app, relatively low number of users, companies located outside the USA), I really don't want to take that risk.

Therefore, I'm currently favoring the second method. It might be some effort for Customer A, but it's still convenient for the users and it doesn't violate the EULA as far as I can tell.

However, I still hope to find a method which doesn't force our customers through a relatively complicated application process (especially since most of them don't have a DUNS number).

   I`m building an app that (to make it simple) allows people to ""challenge"" themselves and others. I need to store locally the challenges the user has already accepted, so that he can browse their details offline. However, when the app is online I`m making requests to the server to display the available challenges, the new details of the already accepted challenges, etc. So some syncing will be needed, but I`m trying to keep that to the minimum.
   Now my problem is how to architecture the data. Should I:

(1) Have a core data model only for the data that is stores on the device; then just build model classes for the challenges that are being parsed from the server, and display an array of Challenge objects in my table views?

(2) Have a single core data model for both, but somehow distinguish between the Challenges that are local to the ones that are transient?

(3) Have two persistent stores, one for each purpose?

    
    Options 2 and 3 obviously have the advantage of using NSFetchedResultsController, but may be more complex to code and maintain.
    And, as to the syncing problem, should I:

(4) Keep a timestamp of the last time each of my local Challenges were updated, and match these with the timestamps on the server, to see if I need to push new details to the server or not?
(5) Save an array of keypaths and the changes, and then push that to the server once internet connection is available again.

    What would be the best approach to solve these two problems.

1. If I add a layer by using this:

   `CALayer *drawLayer = [CALayer layer];`

   How will I handle the delegate of this layer? I am aware that a UIView can't be a delegate of another layer since it is the delegate of its own (In this case, the view's layer is already being used to draw the PDF contents into it), so if I want to have my custom drawings inside the layer I added, where should I set my delegate?

2. I want the drawings to appear as if they were being drawn *under* the text. What I did is use the `kCGBlendModeMultiply`, but since I'll be drawing in another layer, will this have the same effect?

3. I want the drawings to be saved when the user taps a button. When I used UIImage as the drawing area, I was able to save it by creating a folder and save the image as a PNG Representation. Now if the drawing is created in the layer, will I be able to save it as well? 

I hope someone can answer my questions, or at least give some clarifications. Any help will be very much appreciated.

I have a table where I'm sorting rows by dueDate ascending. Some records have due dates, some don't (nil). I prefer to show all the rows with due dates before those that don't.
Example: Jan 1, 2011; Feb 1, 2011; June 1, 2011; nil; nil; nil

However, the default sorting puts the nil values first, as expected:
nil; nil; nil; Jan 1, 2011; Feb 1, 2011; June 1, 2011

I tried using an NSComparisonResult block in a sort descriptor and besides having some difficulty actually getting it to fire (probably due to some logic elsewhere - I am toggling different sorts in the same view), I can't get it to actually compare the null key values to the ones with dates. I think this makes sense, as the managed objects whose @""dueDate"" keys are null are more or less skipped over by the comparison for those where there are actually objects to compare.

At this point, I believe my only option is to hack through this and make the ""no due date"" records set to have a date far into the future, eg Jan 1, 3000. Anywhere that 1/1/3000 date might be shown, hide the value as if it were actually null.

Does this sound right and reasonable?

        [self.view addSubview:_containerView];
        
        [_containerView addSubview:self.viewController.view];
    }

And then in my HomeView I add an UIScrollView like this

        backgroundView = [[UIScrollView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0,MARGIN_TOP, 1024,768 - MARGIN_TOP)];
        backgroundView.backgroundColor = [UIColor colorWithPatternImage: [UIImage imageNamed:@""bottom-bg-repeat.png""]];;
        [self.view addSubview:backgroundView];

Do I need to set autoresizingmasks for backgroundView (UIScrollView) ? Infact, I tried that too but didn't succeed. Appreciate if someone could help me set the right values for autoresizingmasks.

Thanks

Any ideas what is going on here? This seems to be the normal way to parse JSON using JsonKit.

I'm trying to add an in-background alarm clock feature to an app I'm developing.

I have read up on the UILocalNotification object and its use, and am aware that it is limited to 30 seconds of audio.

I was thinking of scheduling multiple notifications (say, 5 of them) spaced 30 seconds apart to mimic continuous play, but the problem with this approach is that if the user hits Close, I won't be able to cancel any of the subsequent notifications.

As far as I know, it is impossible to remove or hide the Close button without hiding the notification entirely (i.e., setting the alertBody property to Nil).

So, I thought I might use the repeatInterval property to cause the notification to pop up every 30 seconds, but it seems that I can only set the interval to one minute or one second, and nothing in between.

The feature is meant to allow the user to choose between music and beeps for alarm audio; it seems I may have found a way to do the beeps - setting the repeatInterval to one second, create a second's worth of beeps (which would need to be timed to cleanly repeat) and use that as the notification sound.

However, for the music, this approach limits me to playing 30 seconds of audio, followed by a 30-second gap, followed by 30 seconds of audio, and so on.

I know that there is no straightforward solution here, from my reading of other posts and resources; no third-party app has access to the same functionality as the built-in alarm clock.  I am hoping that someone has found a workaround or thinks of something really clever.

Is there a way to 'round' this edge?

I want to use Core Animation to render some effects, then export it to video file via AV Foundation. The animation effect I want to achieve is replaying end-user signing his/her signature on the iPad.

**What I've achieved so far:**
 - With referring GLPainter sample from Apple, I'm able to record the strokes of user signature, each individual stroke is composed of a number of touch points (CGPoint) which have been recorded in touchBegin/touchMoved/touchEnd method of my custom UIView.
 - Driven by a repeatable NSTimer, I'm able to re-draw it on my custom UIView. Mainly it's a repeating process of drawing line from one point to the next.

**What I'm trying to do:** 
implement the signature re-drawing with Core Animation technology, then later on, embedded the core animation code with Av Foundation composition code to render the final output.

**What concerns me now:**

 - Knowing nothing about Core Animation, I've been learning it in the last few days. However, the tutorials/books I've read only tells me how to make implicit animation by altering CALayer's properties, or make CAKeyframeAnimation. But my animation is sort of drawing something on the layer's canvas progressively instead of moving something. So, how to do this in Core Animation?

**What I'm doing now:** is quite similar to what I did with Quartz2D, I use a NSTimer to repeatedly set my CALayer object needsDisplay, which in turn invokes its delegate's implementation of drawLayer:inContext method, where I write fairly the same code as I wrote in UIView's drawRect. 

Well, I did kind of *animation*, without any CAAnimation involved. I'm just feeling weird, feeling I'm doing it wrong. I haven't proceeded to the combining Core Animation with AV Foundation part, but I doubt my heck won't get through.

I did honest search in SO I swear but found nothing related. My experience in Quartz2D and Core Animation is quite limited I have to say, so, really appreciate if someone could give me some hints, thank you!

I have made sure classes are disposed property.  Maintained hard references at the class level instead of function scope, for things that might be getting GC'd while I am using them, etc.

Basically the app works fine in the simulator, but crashes at the same spot on a real device.  Seems like I get a few different stacks, but they are all around the same place.

I have made sure classes are disposed property.  Maintained hard references at the class level instead of function scope, for things that might be getting GC'd while I am using them, etc.

Basically the app works fine in the simulator, but crashes at the same spot on a real device.  Seems like I get a few different stacks, but they are all around the same place.

I am using a large amount of events in my application.  Too many threads?

    CGColorSpaceRef colorSpace = CGColorSpaceCreateDeviceRGB();

I believe something might be wrong with the allocation of context since the created images are returned of desired size (315x44). What did I miss? What else can I check that would help me debug this problem?

Something similar to Words With Friends or Draw Something, where once you have logged in you have a list of friends who you can challenge to a game.

I have two View Controllers loaded into a root View Controller. Both sub view layouts respond to orientation changes. I switch between the two views using [UIView transformationFromView:...]. Both sub views work fine on their own, but if...

1. Views are swapped
2. Orientation Changes
3. Views are swapped again

the View that was previously hidden has serious layout problems. The more I repeat these steps the worse the problem gets. 

**Implementation Details**

I have three viewsControllers. 

1. MyAppViewController
2. A_ViewController
3. B_ViewController

A & B ViewControllers have a background image each, and a UIWebView and an AQGridView respectively. To give you an example of how i'm setting it all up, here's the loadView method for A_ViewController...

    - (void)loadView {
    	
    	[super loadView];
    	
        // background image
        // Should fill the screen and resize on orientation changes
    	UIImageView *bg = [[UIImageView alloc] initWithFrame:self.view.bounds];
    	bg.contentMode = UIViewContentModeCenter;
    	bg.autoresizingMask = UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleHeight | UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleWidth;
    	bg.image = [UIImage imageNamed:@""fuzzyhalo.png""];
    	[self.view addSubview:bg];
    	
    	// frame for webView
        // Should have a margin of 34 on all sides and resize on orientation changes
    	CGRect webFrame = self.view.bounds;
    	webFrame.origin.x = 34;
    	webFrame.origin.y = 34;
    	webFrame.size.width = webFrame.size.width - 68;
    	webFrame.size.height = webFrame.size.height - 68;
    
    	projectView = [[UIWebView alloc] initWithFrame:webFrame];
    	projectView.autoresizingMask = UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleHeight | UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleWidth;
       	    	
    	[self.view addSubview:projectView];

    }

For the sake of brevity, the AQGridView in B_ViewController is set up pretty much the same way. 

Now both these views work fine on their own. However, I use both of them in the AppViewController like this...

    - (void)loadView {
        	
        	[super loadView];
        	
        	self.view.autoresizesSubviews = YES;
        	[self setWantsFullScreenLayout:YES];
        	
        	webView = [[WebProjectViewController alloc] init];
        	[self.view addSubview:webView.view];
        	
        	mainMenu = [[GridViewController alloc] init];
        	[self.view addSubview:mainMenu.view];
        	
        	activeView = mainMenu;
        	
        	[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self selector:@selector(switchViews:) name:SWAPVIEWS object:nil];
        	
        
        }

and I switch betweem the two views using my own switchView method like this

    - (void) switchViews:(NSNotification*)aNotification;
    {
    	NSString *type = [aNotification object];
    	
    	if ([type isEqualToString:MAINMENU]){
    		[UIView transitionFromView:activeView.view toView:mainMenu.view duration:0.75 options:UIViewAnimationOptionTransitionFlipFromRight completion:nil];
    		activeView = mainMenu;
    	}
    	
    	if ([type isEqualToString:WEBVIEW]) {
    		[UIView transitionFromView:activeView.view toView:webView.view duration:0.75 options:UIViewAnimationOptionTransitionFlipFromLeft completion:nil];
    		activeView = webView;
    	}
    	
        // These don't seem to do anything
    	//[mainMenu.view setNeedsLayout];
    	//[webView.view setNeedsLayout];
    
    }

I'm fumbling my way through this, and I suspect a lot of what i've done is implemented incorrectly so please feel free to point out anything that should be done differently, I need the input. 

But my primary concern is to understand what's causing the layout problems. Here's two images which illustrate the nature of the layout issues...

So after reading pretty much every article on the web and reviewing stacks of sample code, I'm still not sure how to achieve the following:

1. User chooses to record a sample 2 bars long (4 beats per bar) with a pre-roll/count-in
2. User clicks record
3. A metronome starts which counts in 4 beats (accent on the first beat)
4. The app automatically starts recording on the start of the next bar
5. The app automatically turns off recording at the end of the 3rd bar (the 2 bars + the pre-roll)
6. The user can then playback their recording or delete it and start again.

So, with avaudioplayer and avaudiorecorder I simply created a 'caf' using audacity with a metronome set at the correct bpm (bpm is set for the app). I then setup and play the avaudioplayer and using the audiodidfinishsuccessfully delegate method, performed some logic to start the recorder, restart the player, maintain a loop count etc. to turn off recording and audio.

1. If I create a 1 beat caf file, how could I make use of audio units and remote IO to play x amount of beats and then stop?
2. How could I do the pre-roll and start the recording callback after 4 beats

I decided to focus my attention on the iOS Simulator, Ver 4.3.2, since the image didn't even load up on a powerful desktop computer.

I thought it may be a memory issue with iOS 4.3.2 and Mobile Safari, perhaps related to the resource limits for images ([iOS Development Guidelines][1]).  I understand there is a workaround for image limits (i.e. 6.5MB) but that didn't work for me, either (documented later).

The next thing I looked at was the size and dimension of the image.  I downloaded a few free images (saved as GIFs) from the Internet and stored them locally on the server, all but one similar or larger in size and dimension than the image in question and they all loaded successfully in iOS Simulator, Ver 4.3.2.  

FYI, the image sizes and dimensions were:

 - 238KB, 2428x1531
 - 414KB, 2993x2050
 - 238KB, 2000x1490
 - 196KB, 2192x2541
 - 196KB, 850x638

Going back to the image workaround, if I understand it right, the main idea is wrap the img in a canvas tag (I correctly called the drawImage function in JavaScript), which I did.  Unfortunately, the GIF still did not load.  I tried loading the image as a background-image in a div tag, as well, and, again, this did not work.

I can't think of anything else to try.  Is it possible the GIF is corrupt?  I honestly have no idea what else can I do.

I would appreciate any help.  Thank you.

I want to rotate it (lay it back) in its X axis and then spin it around its Z axis.

I've read every question here that has CATransform3D in the body, I've read Steve Baker's [""Matrices can be your friends""][1] article as well as Bill Dudney's book ""Core Animation for Mac OS X and the iPhone""  I think Brad Larson's [""3-D Rotation without a trackball""][2] has all the right code, but since he's permitting the user to adjust all three axis, I'm having a hard time shrinking his code into what I perceive to be just one dimension (a rotated z axis).

Here's the image I'm testing with, not that the particulars are important to the problem:

![Gold Record][3]

I bring that onscreen the usual way: (in a subclass of UIView)

    - (void)awakeFromNib
    {
        UIImage *recordImage = [UIImage imageNamed:@""3DgoldRecord""];
        if (recordImage) {
            recordLayer = [CALayer layer];
            [recordLayer setFrame:CGRectMake(0.0, 0.0, 1024, 1024)];
            [recordLayer setContents:(id)[[UIImage imageNamed:@""3DgoldRecord""] CGImage]];
            [self.layer addSublayer:recordLayer];
        }
    }

That's the first test, just getting it on the screen ;-)

Then, to ""lay it back"" I apply a transform to rotate about the layer's X axis, inserting this code after setting the contents of the layer to the image and before adding the sublayer:

        CATransform3D myRotationTransform = 
                        CATransform3DRotate(recordLayer.transform,
                                            (M_PI_2 * 0.85), //experiment with flatness
                                            1.0, // rotate only across the x-axis
                                            0.0, // no y-axis transform
                                            0.0); //  no z-axis transform
        recordLayer.transform = myRotationTransform;        

That worked as expected: The record is laying back nicely.

And for the next step, causing the record to spin, I tied this animation to the touchesEnded event, although once out of the testing/learning phase this rotation won't be under user control:

    CATransform3D currentTransform = recordLayer.transform; // to come back to at the end
    CATransform3D myRotationTransform = 
                    CATransform3DRotate(currentTransform,
                                        1.0, // go all the way around once
                                        (M_PI_2 * 0.85),    // x-axis change
                                        1.00,    // y-axis change ?
                                        0.0);   // z-axis change ?
    recordLayer.transform = myRotationTransform;        
    CABasicAnimation *myAnimation = [CABasicAnimation animationWithKeyPath:@""transform.rotation""];
    myAnimation.duration = 5.0;
    myAnimation.fromValue = [NSNumber numberWithFloat:0.0];
    myAnimation.toValue = [NSNumber numberWithFloat:M_PI * 2.0];
    myAnimation.delegate = self;
    [recordLayer addAnimation:myAnimation forKey:@""transform.rotation""];

So I'm pretty sure what I'm hung up on is the vector in the CATransform3DRotate call (trust me: I've been trying simple changes in that vector to watch the change... what's listed there now is simply the last change I tried).  As I understand it, the values for x, y, and z in the transform are, in essence, the percentage of the value passed in during the animation ranging from fromValue to toValue.

If I'm on the right track understanding this, is it possible to express this in a single transform?  Or must I, for each effective frame of animation, rotate the original upright image slightly around the z axis and then lay the result down with an x axis rotation?  I saw a question/answer that talked about combining transforms, but that was a scale transform followed by a rotation transform.  I have messed around with transforming the transform, but isn't doing what I think I should be getting (i.e. passing the result of one transform into the transform argument of the next seemed to just execute one completely and then animate the other).

My app works great in the simulator, and on iPhone / iPod, I've only got iOS 5 to test on devices but I've set up my code so that if there is no twitter account in the system, or the app cannot use it, it uses this ""fallback"".

The problem is I am getting the following error message:

""The request token for this page is invalid. [...]""

Please note that this is before we even get to OAuth or anything API... This occurs in the modal web view that pops up to ""authorise"" the application with your login.

As I said, works great everywhere although I can run into this from time to time on the iPhone .

- Using Xcode to downgrade
- Downloading the firmware image and providing it to Xcode
- Using iTunes
- Using an old computer that the phone was sync'ed to back in 2009 (funny enough, I have two of them)
- Using the iRestore and libusb

So far the only thing I've seen is the phone getting stuck in DFU mode or a message saying that it can't be downgraded (I forget the exact language).

It would seem that Apple would provide for a way for developers to do this sort of thing without this much pain an agony.  I have eight iOS devices, four of which are permanently devoted to development, two iPods and two iPhone 3GS.  The two iPods stayed with iOS 4.x.  Both 3GS's where accidentally upgraded to iOS 5.  I wanted one to stay with 4.x for the time being.

Do I have any options beyond what I've tried?

Apple:  A little developer love would go a long way here.  It's enough to have to deal with all the stuff that breaks from release to release of the OS and Xcode.  At least make this easy. 
Pretty please?

It is a subclass of UIView that has a staging area that has a bunch of subviews placed in a grid-like manner.  Currently I place the GridView into a UIScrollView in the nib.  When the GridView loads, it has to load all of the subviews at once, even the ones that are not visible.

For example, if I have a grid with 5 columns and 500 rows, it will load all 2500 views at once, which as you can imagine, take a long time.  I would like to implement it so that it only loads the views that are visibile, and as the user scrolls, load the the new views.  This is similar to how UITableView loads its cells.

I assume it will follow the same pattern as UITableView, but I'm not quite sure on how to get started.  Anyone have any pointers/tips?

My idea was to use UIPanGestureRecognizer and then test on the velocity. This works, but how do I set a correct animation duration for the moving of the UIView based on the view's current location and velocity of the pan so that it seems smooth? If I set a fixed value, the animation either starts to slow or to fast compared to my fingers swipe speed.

It occurs to me, though, that I don't want to continuously be calling `drawRect:` just to get a screen shot! I don't want to actually initiate any extra drawing, just capture what's on screen.

    - (void)dealloc
    {
        [_model release];
        [super dealloc];
    }
    
    ...

The XCode Analyzer reports a potential memory leak on the line *after* the allocation of the model (it did go away when I added an `autorelease` statement, so I guess it just got mixed up with the line numbers). Is this truly a memory leak or is the analyzer confused? After all a release is done in the dealloc method. So is there a potential of a memory leak here and in which situations?

If that's so I guess the solution would be to add `autorelase` to the allocation.

What I'm trying to achieve is to support Landscape mode in both orientations, so if user turns the device 180 degress, the screen should also rotate. But there should be no action at all, when user rotates the device to one of portrait orientations. Instead, I'm seeing width changes to navigator action bar and sometimes content in portrait orientations, so apparently preventing the event is not enough.  I'm using the ""official"" way Adobe suggests, but the problem is that it's not working very well. Granted, the stage does not change, but it seems that there's something firing in navigator anyway, since you can see the action bar width changing.

I had some success with explicitly setting layoutbounds to fixed width in handler method - this prevents changing the actionbar width, but it's only a temporary solution - if the view is a subject to a transition, or some other redraw - it will again render with bad sizes. As if there was something below that was telling it that it's in portrait mode, even though I'm trying to prevent it.

Before you detonate with some silly ideas like ""autoOrient = false"", don't. It's clearly not a solution for this problem. Obviously it's a bug with Flex SDK - did anyone find a way to fix it or a stable workaround?

http://www.screencast.com/users/PascalFritzen/folders/Jing/media/a9ae52f5-8d1c-4f5d-9156-cff752fe1f37

While trying to fix the problem I checked the option ""Use Core Data"" and the app looked like the Apple version. But later on the code of it also doesn't match with the tutorial :(

Thanks for reading & I hope someone can help me with this :)",3

The faster user moves the device, faster the ball will move in circle. The ball has to follow all physical laws as well.


I am getting gravity and userAcceleration components from CMMotionManager but unable to make some sense out of it.


I tried applying force manually and that works realistically, but I am unable to move the ball in the circle depending on how much user moved the device.
Like if I put a small ball in a glass and shake the glass, the ball will move in the circular bottom of the glass and comes to rest in the direction of tilt of glass when there is no more external force moving/tilting the glass",5

    [self.tickets addObject:decDict];
    [self.tickets addObject:approvDict];

With this global `NSArray *tickets` set, I can then display every ticket in a sectioned UITableView (as per the tutorial). I'm using custom cells that pull information from each ticket in the array, and display them;

              error:&err byAccessor:^(NSURL* writingURL) {

This works fine on Device1, everything stays in synch.
On Device2:
I was trying to rely on NSMetadataQuery notifications:
Initial file list is coming in fine on NSMetadataQueryDidFinishGatheringNotification
Document adds/changes are coming in fine via NSMetadataQueryDidUpdateNotification
 
When i delete a file on Device1, I get a strange result: an update comes in NSMetadataQueryDidUpdateNotification with all my docs (except the one deleted) listed
I'm not sure how I am supposed to detect that the missing file was deleted or that the update notification was for that purpose
Question 1: What should I be checking for?
 
I tried another route which was to register as a NSFilePresenter for the iCloud URL:
- (NSURL *)iCloudDocumentsURL
{
    return [[NSFileManager defaultManager] URLForUbiquityContainerIdentifier:nil] URLByAppendingPathComponent:@""Documents""];
}
I now get called via the NSFilePresenter protocol when files in that URL change, but it's punitively slow to run the logic to determine the missing doc since the callback is vague.
The only call I get back is - (void)presentedItemDidChange;
I was expecting to get a callback via - (void)accommodatePresentedSubitemDeletionAtURL:(NSURL *)url completionHandler:(void (^)(NSError *errorOrNil))completionHandler
But this method is never called.

Not sure how to use correctly the delegate in the SetSampleBufferDelegatequeue method. Also not found an equivalent mechanism to dispatch_queue_t object that works fine in Objective-C to pass in the second parameter.

This seems to have made it difficult for me to add a drop shadow to the layers as when i turn `clipsToBounds` ON the shadows are clipped also.

I have been trying to manipulate `view.frame` and `view.bounds` in order to add a drop shadow to the frame but allow the bounds to be large enough to encompass it, however I have had no luck with this.

Here is the code I am using to add a Shadow (this only works with `clipsToBounds` OFF as shown)

    view.clipsToBounds = NO;
    view.layer.shadowColor = [[UIColor blackColor] CGColor];
    view.layer.shadowOffset = CGSizeMake(0,5);

Hello! I got the idea to write your own optimized class for viewing images and video. I've met a lot of examples, but they are not quite flexible. They are very convenient and easy but I think we can make a class that would meet the many requirements and would be more flexible. I want my viewer to have the ability to upload a sufficiently large number of images with sizes of about 200-400 kilobytes. And also had the opportunity to displays thumbnails of videos and play them.

**What I've tried**

I used some of these links that helped me with the solution of some problems.

This link helped me when I tried to load asynchronously in Table View thumbnail images:
http://www.markj.net/iphone-asynchronous-table-image/

This link helped me when I tried to load asynchronously in Scroll View images. This is all class what I needed for scrolling my images:
https://github.com/mwaterfall/MWPhotoBrowser

**What I want**

I want to make new class. I want the programmer was able to quickly integrate it with your project. And I need your help in this! **Thanks to all who can help!**

My question is: when submitting an iOS app to apple, how long does the check take? Is it days or weeks before it is available in the app store (assuming it passes the tests)?

Timing is very crucial for this app, as we want it to be as good as possible, but as it is intended for a sports event taking 4 days, proper timing is essential to avoid release after the event has ended.

Though somebody who have release apps before could be helpful.

I have created two files 
1. A file which extends nsobject, and,
2. A file which extends views.
Here is source code for both the files:

    #import ""gpMapViewAnnotations.h""
    
    @implementation gpMapViewAnnotations
    @synthesize title, coordinate;
    
    - (id)initWithTitle:(NSString *)ttl andCoordinate:(CLLocationCoordinate2D)c2d {
    	
    	title = ttl;
    	coordinate = c2d;
    	return self;
    }

   this is the code for interface file. 

    #import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
    #import <MapKit/MapKit.h>
    
    @interface gpMapViewAnnotations : NSObject <MKAnnotation>{
      
        NSString *title;
    	CLLocationCoordinate2D coordinate;
    }
    @property (nonatomic, copy) NSString *title;
    @property (nonatomic, readonly) CLLocationCoordinate2D coordinate;
    
    - (id)initWithTitle:(NSString *)ttl andCoordinate:(CLLocationCoordinate2D)c2d;
    
    
    @end



@end

Now this is the source code for view files:

The idea is that the user presses the button and then a window pops out. This is declared in the target/action of the button (i.e. tapping the button calls 

    (void)showMyWindow:(id)sender

where the sender is the UIBarButtonItem.

In the showMyWindow: method, the drawing of the pop-up window requires the frame of the sender. Now, UIBarButtonItem doesn't typically allow you to access its frame. As a bit of a hack, I've cast the sender to a UIView and then accessed this UIView's frame. I didn't think this would work but, surprisingly, it does.

However, I also want to call the showMyWindow: method elsewhere. So I have this line of code:

    [self performSelector:@selector(showMyWindow:) withObject:self.informationButton];

Here, my app crashes. I've pinpointed the problem exactly to this:

    (void)showMyWindow:(id)sender

        //I should be checking before the cast here, but it helps illustrate the problem
        UIView *senderAsView = (UIView *)sender
        CGRect frame = senderAsView.frame;
        ...
    }

The point is: I can somehow perform this cast+access the frame when I call the method with target-action, but not when I use performSelector:withObject:

Why is there a difference? Why can this cast be performed in one case but not the other?

Thanks.

I know that it is possible to make a table view in a single vied app. But how do i combine the rss reader with the app ? :)

My application times out while trying to connect to host. The timeout time is set to unlimited so I take it that the client is really just unable to connect at all.

I have an iPad app running asyncsockets and I'm trying to get it to connect to a server on my desktop also using asyncsockets. The iPad is specifically iOS 5 and is using GCD asyncsockets.

The server is being invoked through a NSRunLoop. It receives no form of connection from the client (none of breakpoints are caught like they are for telnet connections).

I'm able to telnet into the server from other machines just fine. I'm also able to connect the iPad client to host:google.com on port:80 just fine.

I've tried connecting the iPad to the server on ports 8080, 4500, and 50000 all to no success (they all work for telnet though).

I believe there is something in the server code causing this but I am not sure.

My server code is from a sample found here: http://mysterycoconut.com/blog/2010/07/tweak-away/

My client code is modified HTTP client code from the sample GCD code supplied by the asyncsockets repository: http://code.google.com/p/cocoaasyncsocket/source/browse/GCD/Xcode/SimpleHTTPClient/Mobile/SimpleHTTPClient/SimpleHTTPClientAppDelegate.m

I'm able to telnet into the server from other machines just fine. I'm also able to connect the iPad client to host:google.com on port:80 just fine.

I've tried connecting the iPad to the server on ports 8080, 4500, and 50000 all to no success (they all work for telnet though).

I believe there is something in the server code causing this but I am not sure.

My server code is from a sample found here: http://mysterycoconut.com/blog/2010/07/tweak-away/

My client code is modified HTTP client code from the sample GCD code supplied by the asyncsockets repository: http://code.google.com/p/cocoaasyncsocket/source/browse/GCD/Xcode/SimpleHTTPClient/Mobile/SimpleHTTPClient/SimpleHTTPClientAppDelegate.m

Here is my server code:

            connectedClients = [[NSMutableArray alloc] initWithCapacity:1];
            running = false;
        }
        return self;
    }
    
    - (void) dealloc;
    {
        [self stop];
        [connectedClients release];
        [debugServer release];
        [super dealloc];
    }
    
    - (void) startOnPort
    {
        if (running) return;

            _port = 0;
        
        NSError *error = nil;

sorry that this image has a problem that the ""day"" relationship of ""Week"" entity should be to-many, there should be 2 arrows on the end of the relationship

now here comes 2 questions.

1st. For any Day-Class (Customized subclass of NSManagedObject) objects, after I take care about its relationships like:

    Week* aWeek;
    Day *aDay;
    [aWeek addDayObject:aDay];

then I can truely find the Day through the Week Entity's relationship ""day"",

but inversely, I found that the relationship ""thisWeek"" of the Day object ""aDay"" is still nil.

I've heard that after you creat your subclass of NSMangedObject, you got methods like 

    - (void)addXXXObject:(xxx)xxx

to help you deal with to-many relationships and would automatically take care with the inverse relationship.

but here it seems not. So do I have to deal with the inverse relationship by my self,

or if core data does provide, how can I make it automatically add the object on the inverse relationship?

2nd. Suppose there are many ""Day""s with one ""Week"", connected by their relationship,

what I want is , everytime the user delete one of the Days, we check whether if the Week still has some Days in relationship,

if it does, just let the user delete that Day,

if not, we also delete the ""Week"" object.

So what Delete Rule of the to-many relationship should I use?

I'm not so clear with these rules..

I am using a UIScrollView to handle zooming and dragging of an image that is being displayed on a UIImageView.

The image in the UIImageView is requested from a web server multiple times a second.  When the orientation of the device changes the image dimensions change to that of the current frame, for example when using an iPad in portrait mode the image dimensions will be 768x1024 but when switching to landscape mode the dimensions of the image will be 1024x768.  The webserver does the work of adding black bars to the top/bottom or left/right of the image depending on the orientation and aspect ratio of the image I am requesting.

My problem is that after rotating the device the UIImageView never behaves the way I expect it to.  My expected behavior is that the UIScrollView will continue to perform its scrolling actions but reset its base view to that of the new frame dimensions after rotation.

If I don't specify a contentMode for the UIScrollView then the Image appears squished as though the ScrollView is trying to display the image in the previous orientations dimensions.

I find working on projects being pretty efficient with the combined power of all the software installed on the two operating systems, which happily communicate through the VMware's shared folder. iOS devices connect via USB to the virtual machine's iTunes and Xcode just fine, like it was a real Mac. However, the names of nearly all the (virtual) devices of the virtual machine have a ""VMware"" in them, which makes the VM not so real in the Apple's eyes if Xcode gathers and reports machine statistics during installation or app submission.
