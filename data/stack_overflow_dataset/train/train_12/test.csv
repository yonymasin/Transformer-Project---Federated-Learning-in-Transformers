This service uses Bluetooth, in particular registers a Bluetooth Service with a given Name that listens for communications. Of course to work it has to have the Bluetooth active.

As also shown on the Bluetooth api docs I'm using the

`BluetoothAdapter.ACTION_REQUEST_ENABLE` to prompt the user to enable Bluetooth in case it's not on, already. This, though is an activity, and therefore needs to be called from another activity, i.e.:

    Intent enableIntent = new Intent(BluetoothAdapter.ACTION_REQUEST_ENABLE);
    InstanceOfAnActivity.startActivity(enableIntent);

What I would want to achieve, though, is to have the service (which, for example, starts up at boot), completely decoupled from any Activity, and therefore wouldn't have the ""InstanceOfAnActivity"" to start up the pop-up instructing the user to turn on Bluetooth.

Now, I know that there's the (infamous) call to `BluetoothAdapter.enable()` but as the doc says it shouldn't be called directly.

So, any tip/solution to this dilemma? (Maybe it's easy and I'm just missing something...)

Thank you in advance.

![Normal view][1]![All hell breaks loose][2]

I suspect that this behavior is due to me calling `mCategories.get(position)`. Because the Views are never kept in the background and Android regenerates them every time, I never get the same item, as `position` will rarely have the same value. 

Is there a way to get a constant id, which could allow me to get items with fixed positions ? I tried to use getItemID, but I do not understand how to implement it.

I have been trying to marry Boost and android on windows for long time and tried lot of approaches but still no luck. I want to make a sample program using Boost library in android. I am following this tutorial [here.][1] 

As this tutorial suggested i have kept my Boost lib in ****(Android NDK)\sources\boost_1_44_0**** compiled it successfully.

Then i made an **Android.mk** file inside **sources/boost_1_44_0** and made the entry of each library which i want to use. In this case lib. file is **libboost_date_time-gcc-mt-s-1_44.a** available in **boost_1_44_0/android/lib/**  
Here is the content of **Android.mk** file.  

    LOCAL_PATH:= $(call my-dir)
    include $(CLEAR_VARS)
    LOCAL_MODULE:= boost_date
    LOCAL_SRC_FILES:= boost_1_44_0/android/lib/libboost_date_time-gcc-mt-s-1_44.a
    LOCAL_EXPORT_C_INCLUDES := $(LOCAL_PATH)
    include $(PREBUILT_STATIC_LIBRARY) 
  
Now the next step is to make an **Android.mk** file in my project directory, inside **jni** folder.(this is to create a shared library.). Here are its contents.   

    LOCAL_PATH := $(call my-dir)
     include $(call all-subdir-makefiles)
     
    include $(CLEAR_VARS)
     
    # Here we give our module name and source file(s)
    LOCAL_LDLIBS := -llog -ldl
    LOCAL_MODULE    := ndkfoo
    LOCAL_SRC_FILES := ndkfoo.cpp
    LOCAL_STATIC_LIBRARIES := boost_date
    include $(BUILD_SHARED_LIBRARY)
    $(call import-module,boost_1_44_0) 

Here is the Application.mk file placed on the same location, inside **jni** folder. Contents of Application.mk file are as follows.  

    APP_STL      = gnustl_static
    APP_CPPFLAGS = -fexceptions  

And finally here is my ndkfoo.cpp file

    #include <string.h>
    #include <jni.h>
    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <boost/date_time.hpp>

    using namespace boost::gregorian;
    
    void Java_com_ndkfoo_NdkfooActivity_invokeNativeFunction(JNIEnv* env, jobject javaThis) {
    	date weekstart(2002,Feb,1);
    
    }
this program might not be correct but the problem is that it does not recognize any boost  headers or function. and i always get compilation error. 

Is there something i am missing or doing incorrectly? Any help would be really appreciated.

Thanks.

I have tested the app on a Galaxy Nexus with Android 4 and an Advent Vega with Android 4 and there are no issues with focus.  I can scroll through the form without any problems.  

However, when I test on the target device (a Android 3.2 Orange Tahiti which is a rebranded  Huawei MediaPad), suddenly the focus behaviour is very different. It's difficult to know exactly what the tablet is trying to do. If I hide the soft keyboard and scroll, the tablet tries to focus on EditText views as they come into view and pops up the keyboard every time it successfully focuses which is very annoying.  Also, on occasion the tablet will randomly jump to the last `EditText` in the form, scrolling the user away from their position in the form.

I have tried various focus settings (`requestFocus`, `clearFocus()`, `descendantFocusability`, etc) to no avail.  However, I doubt the problem has anything to do with config as it works fine on other devices.

Is it possible that the focus behaviour in Honeycomb is different to all other versions of Android?  I doubt it but it's worth finding out for sure before resorting to installing a custom ROM just in case I have overlooked a Honeycomb-specific config setting that might fix the problem.

I know the code is terribly long, but i want to know about best practices so that I can expand the code.",android,performance,memory,,,04/24/2011 15:58:56,off topic,1,3802,8,"Modifying android code for performance and not crashing. As much as android development is hurting me, I still want to continue it. I made a previous post and got some good advice on releasing bitmaps but i realized that it would be best to post the code to see what i should change.  The code is long and I am posting all 7 files.  What i want help with is how to change the code to make it work for a phone with only 15 mb of available memory for my app.  I know my code is sloppy because i am used to lots of memory to work with.

Stage 1: Development
During development, developers use tools to perform requirements analysis, design and model a solution, and develop application code.

Stage 2: Testing
During the development process, code may be tested on an iterative basis—typically at specific milestones—by quality assurance engineers.

Stage 3: Production
The production system changes on an ongoing basis. After testing, the release can be delivered to the production environment for use.

Every frame I'm looping through all visible tiles to draw them, that would be 11 * 9 tiles MAX. This however drops my framerate to 38, and that is without even drawing textures on them, just the flat hexagons.

Now I'm trying to figure out how to increase performance. I figured drawing the whole grid at once could be faster, but I have no idea how to do that, since each tile can have a different height, and will most likely have a different texture than a neighboring tile.

i have tried to implement admob with this code(among other):

	public void ads() {

		adView = new AdView((Activity) getContext(), AdSize.BANNER,
				""a14f95c396052e4"");

		LinearLayout.LayoutParams params;
		params = new LinearLayout.LayoutParams(
				LinearLayout.LayoutParams.FILL_PARENT,
				LinearLayout.LayoutParams.WRAP_CONTENT);

		// Create a linear layout
		LinearLayout layout = new LinearLayout((Activity) getContext());
		layout.setOrientation(LinearLayout.VERTICAL);
		layout.setPadding(6, 6, 6, 6);
		layout.addView(adView, params);
		
		

	}

I searched hours for a solution but i can't find any.

Can somebody help me in the right direction?

thanks

Activity A has a ViewPager. The pages of a ViewPager are as known Fragments.

Activity A has a list of complex objects, which I want to display in the pages.

When the user clicks on an item inside the ViewPager activity B must be started. Activity B also needs the list with complex objects.

So I have to pass this list 

A -> Fragment(s) -> B

First I found out that it's not possible to use the fragment's constructor to pass data to it. I have to use parcelable or serializable. In the fragment I then have to parcel or serialize again to pass to B.

But I don't want to serialize or parcel whole list of complex data 2 times only to get it through to B.

I would like to avoid using static fields.

Then I came to the idea to pass a listener to the fragment, which listens to item click, and notifies my activity A and activity A then starts activity B with the data. This looks cleanest for me because A is actually the one the data belongs to, so A starts fragment with data, fragment comes back to A and then A starts B with data. I don't have to pass the data everywhere (serializing!).

But this doesn't seem to work, because how do I pass a listener to the fragment using serialization? What is wrong about using a listener in a fragment to come back to the activity?

How do I solve this?

I am starting a service after boot completed. To do so I added a broadcast receiver which starts the service.I am using the same service in the launcher. I am trying to bind to service by adding extra params to Intent. Getting back results from service by broadcast reply.

The problem is when it first binds, the onBind() on the service is triggered. Further bindings does not call the onBind() on the service. I believe the problem is service starting directly after_boot. When I dont start the service in bootup and let the activity start it with Context.BIND_AUTO_CREATE it does behave as expected.

The only solution I came up with is changing the onUnbind() of the service and issuing onBind() in onRebind() call of the service. I dont like this solution since it might break in later android versions leading the onBind() method being called twice.

So why doesn't subsequent binds are not triggered on the services which start up after boot completed. Any other elegant solutions are welcome.

I have already created the class Hexagon, and my main question is how to render with object Canvas (from android.graphics.canvas) in the method onDraw.

And the other question is, is recommendable to use a SurfaceView to put in the main class as shown in this link: http://blog.vidasconcurrentes.com/android/dibujando-figuras-en-un-canvas-de-android-parte-i/ and the putting directly the DrogAndDrapView as the main layout in the Activity Class.

If not, I need to display an interface to authenticate. I do this with another activity, which has a dialog theme, and I start it in onResume() with flags NO_HISTORY and EXCLUDE_FROM_RECENTS.

Everything works fine when starting the application for the first time. But I have a feature that resets login after some time, if the user is not in an activity. When I test this, I start the applicatio, enter the password, then move back to home. Then when I enter the application again, the background darkens as if the dialog would show, but it doesn't.

At this point, if I press the back button, the darkening from the background activity disappears for a second, then the dialog finally appears.

I used logcat to investigate the case, and the activity lifecycle functions get called properly:

    //For the first start:
    
    onCreate background activity
    onStart background activity
    onResume background activity
    
    onPause background activity

    //entering password

    onResume background activity
    onStop NEW dialog
    onDestroy NEW dialog

Using the SINGLE_TOP flag makes no change. However, if I remove the dialog theme from the dialog activity, it IS shown after the restart.

So far I didn't want to use a Dialog instead of an Activity, because I consider them problematic sometimes and less encapsulated and this part has to be quite secure. You may be able to convince me though..

My phoniOrientationClass is essentially my sensor manager and from there i would like to spit back some of the sensor data to the title bar of my application, ie. 

        context.setTitle(""x: ""+ xData); // or something?  

It doesn't seem like i can make this call from there though?  I am new to java and I see  a lot of people inline their classes in tutorials/examples.  I personally don't like to do that much as i believe it makes messy code.  But i thought since i was passing my application context from my main activity to my glView and then again to my sensor manager that i would be able to make this call?  can someone explain to me how i can?

I've read http://groups.google.com/group/android-developers/browse_thread/thread/a2aac88a08cb56c2/b7dff4ba388cd664?lnk=gst&q=SurfaceView#b7dff4ba388cd664 which sort of answers my question but as far as I can tell, it's a sort of ""tough luck"" answer. So here's my problem:

I'm using SurfaceView in the normal way (lock/unlockAndPost) to draw a bitmap of my game background whenever the surface is changed (e.g. orientation etc) and I'm rendering a series of moving circles (up to 30 with a radius of about 25.f). The x,y data for the positions of these circles is coming from a server and that all runs fine. 
All circle objects are stored in a list and their position is updated taking care to ensure this update is synchronized. 
However, when I draw these circles to the screen (during canvas.lock() ), most of the time they render fine but occasionally (e.g. once every few seconds) some of the circles seem to tear or flicker briefly for a frame. The number of circles is always constant so that's not the problem and there's no concurrent modifications to the list of circles (as I said, it is synchronized). 
I have even tried drawing all these circles to a Bitmap on each  render loop and drawing that bitmap to the main canvas. This just seems to affect the perfomance even more (~13FPS as opposed to ~30FPS when drawing circles directly to main canvas). 
Sorry if the information is a little vague guys, (trying to keep the company happy :p ) but I was just wondering if anyone could give me a clue? Or am I just out of luck. I should note that the positioning data coming from the server is realtime data and it is vitally important that the rendering reflects these realtime positions.

Example:

I have an Activity which is a list of items.  This list is populated by a CursorAdapter.  Each item has a checkbox and the list is ordered by checked (unchecked items on top and checked items on bottom).  When an item's checkbox is checked, I send an Intent to my IntentService telling it to flag the checked column in the database table for that item, then a message is Broadcasted, the Activity sees it and re-queries the Cursor.

When I'm using a mobile device and start rapidly checking checkboxes, the app essentially hangs.  The UI doesn't hang, but the IntentService in the background does.  I can tell because the Cursor on screen isn't getting refreshed.

It is my understanding that Intents passed to IntentServices are not processed asynchronously.  Is that correct?  It's behaving almost like I need to be using semaphores, but I can't understand why if Intents are queued and processed individually.

Suppose I check 3 checkboxes; so there are 3 Intents queued.  After the first one I broadcast a message, which the Activity receives, telling it to requery it's cursor.  Could a potential problem be because I'm requerying the Cursor at the same time I'm processing the second Intent (updating another row in the table)?  Querying the Cursor happens on the UI thread.

Does anyone have any ideas?

The app will track the user's location and I'd like to set the ID once so that each time the tracking is initiated, the user will always have the same ID. Right now, the program will send the ID and it will stay the same each time it is sent. The problem however, occurs when a user goes back to the main screen, and returns to the screen to initiate tracking. Here is an example of events:

1. User initiates tracking 
2. User goes back to main screen (original ID is lost)
3. User returns to screen with button to initiate tracking 
4. User initiates tracking again (this generates a new ID)

I would like to retain the ID instead of generating a new one each time the user initiates tracking. Any thoughts on how to do this? Here is some code that may help.

The app will track the user's location and I'd like to set the ID once so that each time the tracking is initiated, the user will always have the same ID. Right now, the program will send the ID and it will stay the same each time it is sent. The problem however, occurs when a user goes back to the main screen, and returns to the screen to initiate tracking. Here is an example of events:

1. User initiates tracking 
2. User goes back to main screen (original ID is lost)
3. User returns to screen with button to initiate tracking 
4. User initiates tracking again (this generates a new ID)

I would like to retain the ID instead of generating a new one each time the user initiates tracking. Any thoughts on how to do this? Here is some code that may help.

Presumably there are other configurations as well, and there will be more forthcoming.

However, all I can seem to find about enumerating the number of storage media available are things like [Environment][1], where you can do things like getExternalStorageDirectory(), which returns a File, not File[] or anything like that.

I created a TabActivity and added MapActivity as one of the tabs with:

    spec = tabHost.newTabSpec(""map"").setIndicator(""Map"");
    intent= new Intent().setClass(this, NavisMapActivity.class);
    spec.setContent(intent);
    tabHost.addTab(spec);

In MapActivity I get MapView from xml layout with *findViewById*.

         <com.google.android.maps.MapView
            xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android""
            android:id=""@+id/mapview""
            android:layout_width=""fill_parent""

            android:apiKey=""my_key_is_here""
            android:clickable=""false"" />

When I load the app, everything works perfectly until I switch tabs or call another app. Basically when OnPause is called. Then when I return to the map, its tiles start to flicker constantly. Only solution is to force the app to close.

This happens only with satellite tiles and from version 2.3.5 onward(tested it on an actual phone and in the Eclipse emulator).

So far I have tried:

 - using mapView.destroyDrawingCache() command in onPause function
 - adding mapView via code instead of xml layout
 - destroying whole MapActivity with LocalActivityManager when tab is switched and creating a new one

None of this helped. Could anyone please help me?
Thank you",android,google-maps,,,,,open,0,244,4,"Android GoogleMaps tiles flicker I just started working with Android and I have a problem with my map.
I created a TabActivity and added MapActivity as one of the tabs with:

    spec = tabHost.newTabSpec(""map"").setIndicator(""Map"");
    intent= new Intent().setClass(this, NavisMapActivity.class);
    spec.setContent(intent);
    tabHost.addTab(spec);

In MapActivity I get MapView from xml layout with *findViewById*.

         <com.google.android.maps.MapView
            xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android""
            android:id=""@+id/mapview""
            android:layout_width=""fill_parent""
            android:layout_height=""fill_parent""
            android:apiKey=""my_key_is_here""
            android:clickable=""false"" />

When I load the app, everything works perfectly until I switch tabs or call another app. Basically when OnPause is called. Then when I return to the map, its tiles start to flicker constantly. Only solution is to force the app to close.

This happens only with satellite tiles and from version 2.3.5 onward(tested it on an actual phone and in the Eclipse emulator).

So far I have tried:

 - using mapView.destroyDrawingCache() command in onPause function
 - adding mapView via code instead of xml layout
 - destroying whole MapActivity with LocalActivityManager when tab is switched and creating a new one

None of this helped. Could anyone please help me?

Slightly terrified that something goes awry when I start verifying on my server, and I get a bunch of users whose credit cards have been charged, but don't see the content showing up on their device.

Also, I think the thread of piracy is quite low for my app, but I'm concerned about leaving my marketplace public key embedded in the client. If I do have a popular title some day in the future, attackers could look to some older apps from me and get it out of them (not sure how much of a danger it is if they get the public key).

A tomcat server with the J2EE example OAuth 2.0 provider named 'sparklr' from springsource. When I test it with the example 'Tonr' it works perfectly.
Now I want an Android application that does more or less the same as the example Tonr application. Accessing the photo resources from the sparklr application using OAuth 2.0

But I'm stuck. I'm using the leeloo libraries which have been moved to apache amber. To be exact I'm using the following tutorial: http://simpleprogrammer.com/2011/05/25/oauth-and-rest-in-android-part-1/

The first fase of the application works. The browser starts and I get the sparklr page to login and authorize the request.
But when I try to get the access token the application crashes. I didn't get any wiser from the logcat so I used debug to get the request. The following code builds the request:

    request = OAuthClientRequest.tokenLocation(""http://10.106.0.16:8084/sparklr/oauth/token"")
    				.setGrantType(GrantType.AUTHORIZATION_CODE)

All the parameters are there and it looks correct to me.  But I get the following output:

> {   ""error"": ""invalid_grant"",   ""error_description"": ""Invalid

So obviously something goes wrong with the scope parameter. I tried to set it to 'trust' instead of 'read' but no different result. Do I need to change something in the sparklr application? Or am I doing something wrong with the Android application, and what?

Hope someone can help.

""[Dragable Space][1]"" (a view that you can swipe between screens).
I have a bar at the bottom that lets the user swipe between the spaces,
and if the touch event occurs outside that area, I call
mapView.onTouchEvent(event).

This used to work well in 3.0.1, but I tried in osmdroid 3.0.4, and it
only appears to work for vertical movement (which I suspect is related
to some touch slop setting).

Here is the code from my Dragable Space view.

    @Override
    public boolean onTouchEvent(MotionEvent event) {
        // Check if the current space is the Map space and we are over the map
        // difference is the Y value between the top and bottom of the map area.
        if (this.mCurrentScreen == 1
                        && event.getY() >= topY && event.getY() <= difference){
                Log.d(TAG, ""touch received inside Map Area"");
                // Pass the event directly to the mapView.
                return mOsmv.onTouchEvent(event);
        }
        Log.d(TAG, ""touch received outside Map Area"");
        return super.onTouchEvent(event);
    }

Although this is nasty (the view has to be passed an instance of the
map), it did work fine in versions 3.0.1 and 3.0.2. However, since
3.0.3 it no longer works.

Is there a better way to pass touch events to the osmdroid map now?

I have a demo project that illustrates this problem. The full eclipse
project is [on github][2].

You can change the build path to use a 3.0.1 or 3.0.2 jar, and the map scrolls around correctly inside the larger space, but changing to 3.0.3 or 3.0.4 and any sideways movement is ignored.

Any guidance would be greatly appreciated.

and

    Fragment newFragment = MyFragment.newInstance();

I've been using eclipse and testing it on my phone. I have everything working apart from one aspect. when the app launches the user is taken to a listview set by the listadapter which takes all the contacts from my db4o database (first activity is 'Qtext'). when you click on a contact, a new activity is started by an intent which has the clicked contact passed to the next activity with 'i.putExtra(""New"", tempClick)', tempClick being the selected object. The next activity (called ViewContact )definitely   receives the parcelable object. 

In ViewContact I have made an add phrase button which will allow you to add custom phrases. when pressed an alert dialog box asks the name of the phrase, when you enter and press ""OK"", I add xml through an inflater to my layout, i then set the text of the phrase to whatever the user has inputed in the alert dialog. The inflater works, and the set text works.

Through rigorous testing I have concluded that for some reason my database is not updating, even though it should be. I have read the index tutorial from db4o and have searched a lot for an answer however I have not found one.

So having it on a thread gets undesired behavior, entering and exiting a few times in my Activity makes the list of displayed apps sometimes with items, sometimes empty. Having everything in the UI Thread works like a dream, loads fine everytime. The thing is, the user expects some sort of feedback and I need to provide one. As I start the activity, the screen remains black for 3-4-5-6 seconds (depending on the device and apps installed). How can I provide some sort of feedback ? I am thinking of a ProgressDialog but I don't know how can I start it. Thank you.

I have been building UI by using the xml file and found it quite easy to build static UI.

Now, I need to build a UI where one of the TextView position changes during the runtime. 

Can this be done using xml only??

    <?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?>
    <AbsoluteLayout xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android""

    		android:text=""0%"" 
    		android:layout_width=""wrap_content""

    		android:layout_x=""41dip"" 
    		android:layout_y=""295dip"">
    	</TextView>
    
    </AbsoluteLayout>

Now I can position the TextView anywhere by changing the value in layout_x and layout_y. But how to do this in run time??

I have tried this.

",android,,,,,,open,0,211,7,"xml Attributes and its corresponding related method. I am new to Android Development and currently enjoying it a lot.

I have been building UI by using the xml file and found it quite easy to build static UI.

Now, I need to build a UI where one of the TextView position changes during the runtime. 

Can this be done using xml only??

    <?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?>

    <TextView 
    		android:layout_height=""wrap_content"" 
    		android:text=""0%"" 
    		android:layout_width=""wrap_content"" 
    		android:id=""@+id/percent""

    		android:layout_x=""41dip"" 
    		android:layout_y=""295dip"">
    	</TextView>

The first Toast (mFieldID) works.  It crashes at **if(results.isEmpty())** with a null pointer exception as noted.   Is my ArrayList not populating ?   I would like a code suggestion on how to sequence through this nested array... so that I can systematically update my SQLite database.
",android,sqlite,arraylist,gson,,,open,0,701,13,"Android update SQLite with GSON response ... how should I parse nested JSON? I have tried to figure this out on my own...  starting with two excellent tutorials on GSON parsing  from [High-Speed Blog](http://blog.brianbuikema.com/2010/04/android-how-to-deserialize-both-xml-and-json/) and [Java Code Geeks](http://www.javacodegeeks.com/2011/01/android-json-parsing-gson-tutorial.html).  Several [answers] (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3763937/gson-and-deserializing-an-array-of-objects-with-arrays-in-it/6300251#6300251) on stackoverflow are relevant, but I need more help than a screendump.  I want to update my SQLite database from the following JSON response:

				{
				    ""Field"": ""13"",
				    ""Plants"": [
				        {
				            ""PlantID"": 123,
				            ""PlotID"": 321,
				            ""Row"": 1,
				            ""Post"": 1,
				            ""Position"": 1,
				            ""PlotName"": ""Sunnyside"",
				            ""Breed"": ""Daisy""
				        },

				            ""Post"": 20,
				            ""Position"": 1,
				            ""PlotName"": ""Waterside"",
				            ""Breed"": ""Iris""
				        }
				    ]
				}


my root class (jsonPlots) and 'nested' class (Plants) are as follows:

        public class jsonPlots {
     	  @SerializedName(""Field"")
	        public String mFieldId;
    	  public ArrayList<Plants> PlantArray;

There is a TextView and a CheckBox in each child row. When I click a checkbox the child item gets the strikethru effect showing the item is e.g. finished. When all child items are checked in a group, the group item also gets the strikethru effect. At least it should.
I can set the child items to finished by opening up a context menu by long clicking on an item and select ""Set finished"" or using a gesture. Both procedures are outside the holder so I can call refreshList() (see below code) to recreate the list.

Let's suppose I have two children in a group. I set both children to finished by the menu or gesture-> group item receives the strikethru effect. OK. Let's say now I uncheck one of the children by clicking the checkbox -> the group item still has the strikethru effect, since the list is not refreshed, the getGroupView is not activated.

While doing some GUI work, I got the typical id cannot be resolved error 
(R.id hell I call it).

But I did notice further down the error list several goofy syntax errors in R.java such as...

*Illegal modifier for the class array; only public, abstract & final are permitted*

So I figured something be broke in the code that generates it.
The beginning of my R.java file looked like this...

    public final class R {

I somehow deleted the id portion of ""@+id/VertBar"" and just had ""@+/VertBar"" 
This causes the auto generator to create a class with no name! I guess @+ with no id means just add a constant in an unnamed class. 

In short every R.id hell issue I've had so far has been do to the keyboard-chair interface (me).

		android.provider.Settings.System.putInt(y.getContentResolver(),Settings.System.SCREEN_BRIGHTNESS, y.brightness1);

I can change auto-brighess on and off, and set different levels. The settings seem to be applied properly -- I can go to into Settings --> Display --> Brightness, and whanever setting I set is actually shown correctly. However, the actual screen isn't changing its brightness. If i just tap on the slider in Display Settings, then everything gets applied.

I shoudl mention that I'm running an app withat a main activity, and these settings are getting applied in the BroadcastReceiver. I did try to create a dummy activity and tested the stuff there, but got the same results.",3

I am trying to connect to the ADB daemon on the phone via WiFi (tcp port 5555) so I can debug my application in Eclipse.  However, I just can't get this to work.  

Nothing I try actually results in the ADB daemon on the phone switching to TCPIP mode (as far as I can tell by looking at the output of `getprop`).  The issue seems to be that I can't set the relevant `service.adb.tcp.port` property on the phone.  The development phone I am using is an LG GT540 running CyanogenMod 7.0.0 (Android v2.3.3).  Development machine is iMac running OS X Lion.

Here is some relevant information on what I have tried/confirmed/discovered:

 - The phone is rooted (`ru.secure = 0`)
 - Connecting to ADB via USB works fine
 - The adb service on the Mac is running as root (`adb root`)
 - `adb shell` gives me a shell with super-user access (# prompt, su, ability to edit system files etc)
 - `adb tcpip 5555` does not complain or throw errors when run from a terminal window on the mac but does not set the `service.adb.tcp.port` property on the phone
 - `setprop service.adb.tcp.port 5555` entered at the # prompt of a terminal window on the phone does not complain or throw errors but does not set the `service.adb.tcp.port` property 
 - `setprop persist.service.adb.enable 0` works from both Mac and phone shells (confirmed by checking ADB daemon stops and `getprop` returns 0 for the enable property)
 - `setprop persist.service.adb.enable 1` works fine from both Mac and phone shells (confirmed by checking ADB daemon starts and `getprop` returns 1 for enable property)
 - The only properties on the phone relating to ADB on the phone are `persist.service.adb.enable` and `init.svc.adbd` (if ADB is running)(confirmed by `getprop | grep adb` on the phone)
 - Apps on the market that purport to 'automatically' configure ADB for Wifi (such as [WiFi ADB][1]) do not work either (`tcp.port` property is not set and ADB over TCP does not work)

Am I looking too hard here and missing something obvious?  There are many posts and articles on the Internet relating to problems getting ADB to work over TCP but they all relate to phone rooting issues.

Is anyone able to shed some light on why I can't seem to set this particular property or suggest any other issue that may be preventing the ADB daemon from running in TCPIP mode?

I recently purchased a Motorola XOOM Tablet along with the Desktop Dock and Bluetooth Keyboard accessories.

The dock and keyboard work great, but when I take the tablet off the dock to move away from my desk, the keyboard still remains paired with the device and I have to manually change the settings to use the soft keyboard. The same goes for when I set it back on the dock, I need to manually switch it back. It's not a _huge_ problem, but it would be nice not to have to think about it. 

So I tried downloading an app from the market that simply toggled Bluetooth on and off when connected or disconnected from a power source, which worked well for a while, but the background service would die after period and become useless until I manually restarted that. 

TO THE POINT: I'm trying to write a little app/service for my tablet that will recognize when it has been docked/undocked and switch the ""Use Physical Keyboard"" setting accordingly.

I have started with a BroadcastReciever to recognize the Dock State:
<pre>
public class DockBroadcastReciever extends BroadcastReceiver {

	private final String DOCK_STATE_LABEL = ""android.intent.extra.DOCK_STATE"";
	
	@Override
	public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
		Bundle extras = intent.getExtras();
		String message = (extras.getInt(DOCK_STATE_LABEL) == Intent.EXTRA_DOCK_STATE_UNDOCKED) ? ""Undocked"" : ""Docked"";
		
		Toast toast = Toast.makeText(context, message, Toast.LENGTH_LONG);
		toast.show();
	}
}
</pre>

But I'm having trouble figuring out the best way to update the setting after the event is fired. I've poked around some examples using _InputMethodManager_, but all the methods seem to need a specific _EditText_ or some other input to bind to. 

Furthermore, I can't seem to find a corresponding constant that represents that setting anywhere in the docs, but graphically, it is located here: http://i.stack.imgur.com/esFaw.png

Can anyone help me out with this?
 
I would like for there to be a solution for changing the setting, but I am open to other ideas as well.",android,keyboard,settings,input-devices,,,open,0,304,6,"Android 3.0 Use Physical Keyboard Setting Background:

The dock and keyboard work great, but when I take the tablet off the dock to move away from my desk, the keyboard still remains paired with the device and I have to manually change the settings to use the soft keyboard. The same goes for when I set it back on the dock, I need to manually switch it back. It's not a _huge_ problem, but it would be nice not to have to think about it. 

So I tried downloading an app from the market that simply toggled Bluetooth on and off when connected or disconnected from a power source, which worked well for a while, but the background service would die after period and become useless until I manually restarted that. 

TO THE POINT: I'm trying to write a little app/service for my tablet that will recognize when it has been docked/undocked and switch the ""Use Physical Keyboard"" setting accordingly.

I have started with a BroadcastReciever to recognize the Dock State:
<pre>
public class DockBroadcastReciever extends BroadcastReceiver {

	private final String DOCK_STATE_LABEL = ""android.intent.extra.DOCK_STATE"";
	
	@Override
	public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
		Bundle extras = intent.getExtras();
		String message = (extras.getInt(DOCK_STATE_LABEL) == Intent.EXTRA_DOCK_STATE_UNDOCKED) ? ""Undocked"" : ""Docked"";
		
		Toast toast = Toast.makeText(context, message, Toast.LENGTH_LONG);
		toast.show();
	}
}
</pre>

But I'm having trouble figuring out the best way to update the setting after the event is fired. I've poked around some examples using _InputMethodManager_, but all the methods seem to need a specific _EditText_ or some other input to bind to. 

Furthermore, I can't seem to find a corresponding constant that represents that setting anywhere in the docs, but graphically, it is located here: http://i.stack.imgur.com/esFaw.png

Can anyone help me out with this?

of mine, I would like to know exactly what happens to a context when an exception is caught by a `Thread.UncaughtExceptionListener`. When the uncaught exception is received by the listener, the context seems to have fallen into a limbo state. It has access to some of its methods (primarily the ones pertaining to resources), but then a great many don't work (or don't visibly work). This includes (but isn't limited to, I'm sure there are more I haven't found):

 - `Toast` (as in my link)
 - `Dialog`
 - Creation of new activities. This includes normal `Context.startActivity(Intent)` and `PendingIntent`.

However the context still has apparent access to contextual resources (`getString()`,  `Resources` and oddly enough `Notification`s).

**Why is this? What causes this state imbalance(?) in the context to prevent any context driven calls?**


Below I have created a test application for you that is suppose to launch an error activity when an exception is left uncaught. To test the things I have mentioned  (Toast and dialog) in the situation I have been doing, place their builders in the BoomMitActivity in lieu of the notification builder.

In the given example, the activity error out (how could it not?) and launches BoomMitActivtiy when the `Notification` is clicked. However, BoomMit's `onCreate` is never called.

As you can see, it is receiving the text and attempting to pass it onto my broad cast receiver, but gets that ""Permission Denial"" error. Any help would be appreciated. This is driving me crazy",2

For the first few months I was using HTML5, jquery and php... but found that I was having to build all my own ui controls from scratch because they either didn't exist or perform the way I wanted... and though I found it quite fun at first, it became a hair ripping process trying to make it work cross browser and having to script basic functionality for them at such a high level was causing the ui to lag ridiculously... and yes I did look at jquery ui, yui and other libraries.

I tried out Titanium, but the documentation is so poor and it seems deliberately, so that you pay an arm and a leg to learn about something I've yet to see a properly functioning example of... including their demo!  And the lag! It increased the ui lag so much that even typing was always a second behind!

I tried out wbea, which although I think is fantastic and very promising, using strictly web technology seems not the best approach here.

I tried Air, but even though it always ran best in webkit, air's version of it seems to just mangle it into a non-functioning poorly rendered window.

I tried haxe, and although it seems fantastic, the documentation is poor and for the most part outdated. 

So I've recently been trying out XUL, and why not, Celtx the open source screenwriting program is written in xul, and after a few early hurdles I found it quite easy to jump into, and solved the laggy ui issues, but after a while its many quirks, poor documentation, lack of decent debugging tools, and small developer community, mean every minor hiccup takes forever to solve and I'm really starting to lose confidence in it.

So now I'm thinking of trying something different... here is what I'm looking for in a language/framework...

- Solid scriptable controls/features/api for rich text editing -- (definitely the most important!!)
- Object oriented
- dynamic ui creation
- json and xml parsing
- rich flexible skinable ui -- I'm a film maker, so I'll be damned if I can't control the look and feel!
- not sandboxed! Must be able to save/read from hard drive, zip and unzip archives, export pdfs and access printer!
- Access to web services
- Top notch documentation and debugging!
- Free
- portability of code... OK I know this is can of worms, but I would like it to run, at the very least, on Windows and be able to port it in scaled down form and as painlessly as possible to android, so I can have it in my pocket when I get a good idea...

My background has all been web... html, javascript, php, so nothing too complicated thus far, but if I need to stretch myself and learn something new, so be it. I'm very dedicated to seeing my dream app to fruition.

I'm open to all suggestions, but when you do please cite some examples and good place to start.

Right now I'm analyzing the [magnetic field sensor][1] which should tell me (according to [this documentation page][2]) the values of the ambient magnetic field in uT (micro Tesla). Everything is clear so far but on the 2 devices that I tested on (Galaxy S, Galaxy Gio) the results are different. And by different I mean **very** different.


For example having the same orientation on a table here's what those devices show (just one example):

    S2:  -2,12, 60 (approximate values)
    Gio: -2,12,-36 (approximate values)


Even if I switch positions the results are the same. I also read on [this page][3] about the intensity of the magnetic field and I believe that I should have around 50uT given my geographical latitude.

Can someone explain what those sensors mean? 

Does someone know how to explain this behavior?

Thank you,

Right now I'm analyzing the [magnetic field sensor][1] which should tell me (according to [this documentation page][2]) the values of the ambient magnetic field in uT (micro Tesla). Everything is clear so far but on the 2 devices that I tested on (Galaxy S, Galaxy Gio) the results are different. And by different I mean **very** different.


For example having the same orientation on a table here's what those devices show (just one example):

    S2:  -2,12, 60 (approximate values)
    Gio: -2,12,-36 (approximate values)


Even if I switch positions the results are the same. I also read on [this page][3] about the intensity of the magnetic field and I believe that I should have around 50uT given my geographical latitude.

Can someone explain what those sensors mean? 

Does someone know how to explain this behavior?

Thank you,

Iulian

The drawing would need to be scaled to fit the display since the size is indirectly specified by the user (like in a CAD application).  Also, I don't want to take up the entire display, leaving room for some controls (buttons, etc).  I would pass the data to describe the drawing.  Here's how I imagine it would work.

I create an XML layout that contains something that holds the drawing (ImageView, BitmapDrawable, ShapeDrawable, ...??? not sure exactly what).  Then in my Activity I would load the main XML and obtain the resource for the control that holds the drawing.  I would then draw to a bitmap.  Once the bitmap was completed I would load it into the control that is to hold the drawing.  Somewhere along this path it would be scaled to fill the entire area allocated for the drawing in the XML layout.  

I don't know if my approach is the way to do this or what classes to use.  I read the http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/graphics/2d-graphics.html documentation, but it's not helping me with an example.  The examples I do find leave me with hints, but nothing concrete enough to do what I want, especially when it comes to scaling, using XML and/or having other controls.  Also, there seems to be no good documentation on the design of the 2D drawing system in a more conceptual manner, so it makes what I read difficult to put into any useful context.  

Any hints on what classes would be useful and/or a good example any other reading materials?

I'm starting the article Activity via:

    Intent i = new Intent(getApplicationContext(), NewsDetail.class);

As mentioned, after destroying the activity, there's a rest of 2 MB left to the activity (which doesn't exist if I completely remove the WebView from the code). So it seems to have sth to do with the WebView itself.

I've spent the last 7 hours creating numerous different ""concepts"" for a simple CYOA game engine. (Create Your Own Adventure) I have no problem with displaying/updating graphics, the UI, playing audio, etc. but it's the seemingly simplest of things that's really frustrating me, the core engine itself.

Here's the idea...

There are 4 TextViews: prompt, option1, option2 and option3. When the game begins the user is met with a prompt and 3 options. They then click on an option and all 4 text views update based on what they chose. If the user chooses say...""Buy a hotdog."" from the ""What would you like to buy?"" prompt, the next screen would say something like ""Choose a condiment!"" with 3 different condiments, etc.

I've spent the last 7 hours creating numerous different ""concepts"" for a simple CYOA game engine. (Create Your Own Adventure) I have no problem with displaying/updating graphics, the UI, playing audio, etc. but it's the seemingly simplest of things that's really frustrating me, the core engine itself.

Here's the idea...

There are 4 TextViews: prompt, option1, option2 and option3. When the game begins the user is met with a prompt and 3 options. They then click on an option and all 4 text views update based on what they chose. If the user chooses say...""Buy a hotdog."" from the ""What would you like to buy?"" prompt, the next screen would say something like ""Choose a condiment!"" with 3 different condiments, etc.

I can't independently select them, so when I hook into the ListView's OnListItemClick event, I get a single event for clicking TextView1 and TextView2, they are not distinct.

        final Button button2 = (Button) findViewById(R.id.cancel);
        button2.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
            public void onClick(View v) {

             mp.stop();
             mp.reset();

            }
        });

We are creating a content-based Android app that we would like to sell in the Market using recurring subscriptions. 

Here are my questions:

1. If we use the Android Market in-app billing model, would we need to confirm the purchase every month with the user when we bill their account? Or can we simply ask them when they initially subscribe and then charge them on a monthly basis without a confirmation?

2. Ideally, we really would like to use the Paypal Mobile Payment Library to collect the monthly fee (saves money). If we are collecting our recurring subscription payment each month using Paypal, does this violate the TOS for Android and will our app be pulled by them? Also, we do not want the user to confirm each month that they agree to the charge. We have already have an iphone app released that charges the user on a monthly basis -- we do not need to ask them each month to confirm. The user is simply charged via Apple Subscriptions. We are trying to recreate the same model using Android.

I have looked on various forums for an answer to my second question, but there is so much ambiguity and no one in the Android Community seems to have clearly addressed the answers to these questions. 

Thank you in advance....

I am able to achieve move on touch but as there are 2 imageviews added only latest added imageviews is movable.

I guess problem is layout_width=""fill_parent"" which causes only front imageview to be recognized on touch. and If I am using layout_width=""wrap_content"" than imageview only moves in that image sized area and being invisible.

How to resolve this problem ?

I would like the user to be able to long press to invoke the default browser ""save as"" or ""set as wallpaper"" actions.

Here is what I have as far as code in my java file:

    package com.wallpapergallery.wjd;


    import android.os.Bundle;
    import android.webkit.WebChromeClient;
    import android.webkit.WebView;
    import android.app.Activity;



    public class WallpaperGallerybyWJDDesignsActivity extends Activity {
    /** Called when the activity is first created. */
    @Override
    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.main);
        WebView webview = (WebView)findViewById(R.id.webview);

        
        webview.setWebChromeClient(new WebChromeClient());
        webview.getSettings().setJavaScriptEnabled(true);
        		webview.loadUrl(""file:///android_asset/www/index.html"");
        		
        		
        		
    }
    }

Of course then opens up the index page which I have a normal png placed on the page for testing. Before you answer I warn you I am very new to this so explained help with sample code so I can learn would be appreciated. 

Once this is done my idea is to use an HTML5 gallery to show my wallpapers and allow the user to save/set as wallpaper.

Thanks in advanced!",4

I've managed to get both of the following examples to work:

*2.7  Example 5: 3D Shapes - Rotating Color Cube and Pyramid (Nehe Lesson 5: 3D Shapes)
Example 2: Cube2.java*

*2.8  Example 6: Texture (Nehe Lesson 6: Texture)*

But when I try to draw both a coloured cube and a textured cube I get the following:

(First part of the image)

The coloured cube is invisible but clips the texture cube and the texture cube's textures are coloured by the last colour (yellow) of the coloured cube.

I basically just draw both of the cubes with:

      // ----- Render the Color Cube -----
      gl.glLoadIdentity();                // Reset the model-view matrix
      gl.glTranslatef(0.0f, 0.0f, -6.0f); // Translate right and into the screen
      gl.glScalef(0.5f, 0.5f, 0.5f);      // Scale down (NEW)
      gl.glRotatef(angleCube, 1.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f); // rotate about the axis (1,1,1) (NEW)
      cube.draw(gl);                      // Draw the cube (NEW)

      // Update the rotational angle after each refresh (NEW)
      angleCube += speedCube;         // (NEW)
	      
      // ----- Render the Texture Cube -----
      gl.glLoadIdentity();                // Reset the model-view matrix

I tried adding a third so called ""Photo cube"" from the part ""*2.9  Example 6a: Photo-Cube*"".

***(Can only post 2 links check the imgur link above)***

I added:

     gl.glColor4f(0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f);
to the texture cube and noticed that the blue colour ""spills"" over to the photo cube.

When I add:

     gl.glColor4f(1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f);

the following textures are no longer coloured but this feels like a crude way to remove past colours..


When I remove:

      texturecube.loadTexture(gl, context);    // Load image into Texture (NEW)
      photocube.loadTexture(gl);    // Load image into Texture (NEW)
      gl.glEnable(GL10.GL_TEXTURE_2D);  // Enable texture (NEW)

this happens:

The colour cube is back and all other surfaces are coloured.

**My questions:**

What am I doing wrong when the coloured cube disappears? (I guess that it should be possible to both use textures and colours at the same time)

Is there a better way to ""clear"" the colour from previous cubes/objects other than ""gl.glColor4f(1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f);""?

I'm quite new to OpenGL and Android and I'm sorry if these are retarded questions. I've tried to find the answer myself but I came up with nothing.

Thanks in advance",android,opengl-es,colors,texture,cubes,,open,0,591,9,"Textures and colours not showing properly in OpenGL ES I've been following the tutorials over at http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/android/Android_3D.html and I've encountered a problem.

I've managed to get both of the following examples to work:

*2.7  Example 5: 3D Shapes - Rotating Color Cube and Pyramid (Nehe Lesson 5: 3D Shapes)
Example 2: Cube2.java*

*2.8  Example 6: Texture (Nehe Lesson 6: Texture)*

But when I try to draw both a coloured cube and a textured cube I get the following:

http://i.imgur.com/Smbsa.png
(First part of the image)

The coloured cube is invisible but clips the texture cube and the texture cube's textures are coloured by the last colour (yellow) of the coloured cube.

I basically just draw both of the cubes with:

      // ----- Render the Color Cube -----
      gl.glLoadIdentity();                // Reset the model-view matrix
      gl.glTranslatef(0.0f, 0.0f, -6.0f); // Translate right and into the screen
      gl.glScalef(0.5f, 0.5f, 0.5f);      // Scale down (NEW)
      gl.glRotatef(angleCube, 1.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f); // rotate about the axis (1,1,1) (NEW)
      cube.draw(gl);                      // Draw the cube (NEW)

      // Update the rotational angle after each refresh (NEW)
      angleCube += speedCube;         // (NEW)
	      
      // ----- Render the Texture Cube -----
      gl.glLoadIdentity();                // Reset the model-view matrix
      gl.glTranslatef(-1.0f, 0.0f, -6.0f); // Translate right and into the screen
      gl.glScalef(0.5f, 0.5f, 0.5f);      // Scale down (NEW)
      gl.glRotatef(angleCube, 1.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f); // rotate about the axis (1,1,1) (NEW)
      texturecube.draw(gl);                      // Draw the cube (NEW)

I am making an Android Client and making use of a couple of helper classes someone else handed to me at work. The helper Android classes are called TcpClient.java and PVDCAndroidClient.java. PVDCAndroidClient.java makes use out of the TcpCLient, using a tcpCLient object to connect via serverIP and port. 

Here is PVDCAndroidClient.java:

I know this is a super long post and I am asking a lot but if anyone could take a look at this I would very much appreciate it. I've been at this all day, trying to make use of these helper classes I got and can't get it to work. It also doesn't help that I'm not too experienced in this client/server stuff. Any nudges in the right direction or an accepted solution would REALLY mean something to me. 

Thank you kindly,

Have a good evening.",android,login,tcp,client,,,open,0,3997,10,"Having a bit of trouble tcp connecting in Android Client This might be a complex problem with my application but I'll do my best to describe it as accurately as I can.

I am making an Android Client and making use of a couple of helper classes someone else handed to me at work. The helper Android classes are called TcpClient.java and PVDCAndroidClient.java. PVDCAndroidClient.java makes use out of the TcpCLient, using a tcpCLient object to connect via serverIP and port. 

Here is PVDCAndroidClient.java:

I try to develop an Android App which allows the user to fetch data from flickr and show it in a gridview (with some nice 3D-Animation). After some adventures i got it almost running, but now I'm stuck.


----------


Here's the problem:

I got a UI Thread ""LoadPhotosTask"" which gets the pictures from flickr, just like the open source application [photostream][1]. In the method onProgressUpdate(LoadedPhoto... value) of that subclass I call addPhoto(). Until now everythings fine - I got some nice Bitmap and Flickr.photo data with all the information I need.

    		@Override
		public void onProgressUpdate(LoadedPhoto... value) {

			addPhoto(value);
		}

On the other hand I have got a GridView. Now I want to fill it with the Photos. It has got an adapter called ImageAdapter (which extends BaseAdapter, see this [tutorial][2]). If I use an array inside the ImageAdapter class I can populate the GridView with some sample images. But if I want to populate it at runtime, I don't know what to do.

How do I have to set up the getView method in the ImageAdapter? I was trying to fill the array inside the ImageAdapter class with my values in addPhoto, but it doesn't display anything.

So first of all I was setting up the array with the amount of Photos i wanted to display in the grid like that (code is inside the ImageAdapter class):

    // class variable
    private ImageView[] mThumbIds;
        
        [...] 
        
        public void setupArray(int count) {
        		this.mThumbIds = new ImageView[count];
        	}

Then I call this method with the lenght of my photolist:

    	final Flickr.PhotoList list = params[0];
			final int count = list.getCount();
			int helper = 0;
		imagead.setupArray(count);

Afterwards I call the getView method manually inside the addPhoto method:

    private void addPhoto(LoadedPhoto... value) {

		ImageView image = (ImageView) mInflater.inflate(
		R.layout.grid_item_photo, null);
		image.setImageBitmap(value[0].mBitmap);
		image.setTag(value[0].mPhoto);
		
		imagead.setmThumbIds(image, value[0].mPosition);
		imagead.getView(value[0].mPosition, null, mpicturesGrid);

	}

That is the getView method inside ImageAdapter:
				
			
    	public View getView(int position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent) {

		if (convertView == null) { // if it's not recycled, initialize some
			// attributes
			
			imageView = new ImageView(mContext);
			imageView.setLayoutParams(new GridView.LayoutParams(EDGE_LENGTH,
			EDGE_LENGTH));
			imageView.setScaleType(ImageView.ScaleType.CENTER_CROP);
			imageView.setPadding(0, 0, 0, 0);
			imageView.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE);
			
		} else {

			imageView = (ImageView) convertView;
		}
		imageView.setImageDrawable(mThumbIds[position].getDrawable());
		imageView.setTag(mThumbIds[position].getTag());

		return imageView;

	}

Ok, finally I apologize for my poor english and I hope you can give me some help with the information I provided.

This table has four columns: id, term, definition, category. I have used a FTS3 module to speed up searching which helped a lot. However, now when I try to fetch 'next' or 'previous' row from table it takes longer than it was before I started using FTS3. 

This is how I create virtual table:

    CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE profanity USING fts3(_id integer primary key,name text,definition text,category text);


This is how I fetch next/previous rows:

    SELECT * FROM dictionary WHERE _id < ""+id + "" ORDER BY _id DESC LIMIT 1
    SELECT * FROM dictionary WHERE _id > ""+id + "" ORDER BY _id LIMIT 1

When I run these statements on the virtual table:

- NEXT term is fetch within <b>~300ms</b>,
- PREVIOUS term is fetch within <b>~200ms</b>

When I do it with normal table (the one created without FTS3):

- NEXT term is fetch within <b>~3ms</b>,
- PREVIOUS term is fetch within <b>~2ms</b>

Why there is such a big difference? Is there any way I can improve this speed?

http://staticallytyped.wordpress.com/2011/03/18/android-dynamic-and-custom-title-bars/

""A custom title bar"" - half way down.

On some activities I would like to place a button on the right hand side of the titlebar (same as facebook app).  I have attempted to add a button to the view as follows, but it doesn't appear.

Custom title bar is displayed as follows


`
 requestWindowFeature(Window.FEATURE_CUSTOM_TITLE);   
 setContentView(R.layout.maintabhost);
 getWindow().setFeatureInt(Window.FEATURE_CUSTOM_TITLE, R.layout.headerbar_include); 
`

Attempting to add button as follows.  The button will eventually be an ImageButton and aligned to right of custom titlebar-if I get it working.  (just realised I've too many layoutparams now, but this isnt affecting the button display)


        LinearLayout layout = (LinearLayout) findViewById(R.id.headerbar);
        Button searchButton = new Button(this);
        searchButton.setText(""info"");
        
        LayoutParams layoutParams = new LinearLayout.LayoutParams
        (LayoutParams.WRAP_CONTENT, LayoutParams.WRAP_CONTENT);
        
        searchButton.setLayoutParams(new LayoutParams(
        		ViewGroup.LayoutParams.WRAP_CONTENT,
        		ViewGroup.LayoutParams.WRAP_CONTENT));
        
        layout.addView(searchButton, layoutParams);
        layout.invalidate();


I could just create another custom titlebar with the button already embedded, but a dynamic solution would be better.

Cheers

I have an imageView that I am moving around on top of another imageview. It's kind of circle selector. Its working fine, except that when I click a button elsewhere in the activity, the imageview is moving back to where it starts.

Here is the code for  when I move it.

int upperLeftCornerX = (int)(mLastXTouchSetOval - mClipOvalWidth/2);
		int upperLeftCornerY = (int)(mLastYTouchSetOval - mClipOvalHeight/2);
		
		mImageOval.layout(upperLeftCornerX, upperLeftCornerY, upperLeftCornerX+mClipOvalWidth, upperLeftCornerY+mClipOvalHeight);

The mLastXTouchSetOval and mLastYTouchSetOval are set by a touch event. This works, but as I said, as soon as I click a button on the activity, the mImageOval goes back to the top left corner where it started.

Any ideas?

In my first round of trying to learn how to go about that, I learned that:

 2. `setVisible(true/false)` in onResume()/onPause() respectively is the [best way][1] to tell whether **my** application is running. But what do I do with it once the 2nd instance knows that the 1st instance is running???

Does the system itself use [getApplication()][4] to determine whether to launch a new instance or just bring it to the front of the stack? Is this safe?

If the answer is ""no"", can I just call [Activity.finish()][5] to not let the 2nd activity not even start? If so, where do I do this? Right in [Activity.onCreate()][6]? [Activity.onResume()][7]? A better place?

First of all, let me give an overview of info I found on the net. I will number them so I can refer to them further on.

1. [Specifying tax rates][1]
2. [Charging tax: Checkout shopping cart][2]
3. Within the CheckOut dashboard, one can set the taxes, using one of these settings

- Not charging taxes
You will not be charging your customers tax or will not be using these settings to charge tax.
- European Union: flat rate
All customers in the European Union will be charged the same tax rate.
- European Union Taxes: specifying by country
You select which European Union country you charge tax in and enter a flat tax rate for each country you select. (step 2 is to set this tax)
- European Union and Non-European Union Taxes (step 2 is to set the tax per country)
You select which countries you charge tax in and enter a flat tax rate for each country you select. (step 2 is to set this tax per country)


I have been contacting a qualified tax professional, who told me that

- The tax that is to be charged is the one that applies in the location the product or service has been charged from.
- Through the Android Market, Google sends an invoice on the developers behalf. Therefore the developer should shift the tax responsibility to Google, which in turn pays the tax to the government/authorities.
- In order to shift the tax, the developer needs Google's tax number and the invoices from Google, that shows the charges that have been sent to the customers.

So, to sum this up in a graphic

![enter image description here][3]

And now for the questions (referring to the links and image)

- When I look at an invoice that is sent to me after purchasing an app from the Android Market, it seems the address of the developer is shown, not Google's. So instead of location Y, address Y is address X. Does this mean the tax to be applied is the one of location X instead of the one that applies in location Y? As stated in (1) ""You'll need to take steps to ensure your apps are sold with the proper tax for your location."" This suggests the tax rate is tied to your location, which in my case would be Holland, not Google's location (Ireland/Luxembourg?). The same suggestion is made in (2) ""You are solely responsible for specifying your own tax rates. If tax rates for your location change, you are also responsible for updating the tax rates buyers are charged.""

- In the Checkout dashboard, one can set the tax settings (3). Now if the tax that is to be applied is the one the location the product or service has been charged from, why would you want to specify this per country?

- What is the reason for the European Union distinction, it suggests tax is only to be applied in this region, so not in the US for instance?

- Can one request the actual invoices concerning sales from Google? Or can the list downloadable through Checkout be used rightfully?

- What is / where can we find Google's tax number?

- Next to adding it to the selling price and specifying it on the invoice, does Google actually pay taxes to the authorities if you set taxes through the CheckOut dashboard?

- As far as I know, taxes are calculated from the price before the Google cut?

- Does this process make sense or am I totally wrong about this?

Knowing there are a lot of Android developers out here, I'm really curious about how you guys handle this?

now after going through the lovely set of tutorials and a while spent buried in source code I'm beginning to get the feel for it so what's my next step? well to dive in with a fully featured application with graphics, sound, sensor use, touch response and a full menu.

hmm now there's a slight conundrum since i can continue to use cryptic references to my project or risk telling you what the application is but at the same time its going to make me look like a raving sci-fi nerd so bare with me for the brief...

A semi-working sonic screwdriver (oh yes!) my grand idea was to make an animated screwdriver where sliding the controls up and down modulate the frequency and that frequency dictates the sensor data it returns.
now I have a semi-working sound system but its pretty poor for what its designed to represent and I just wouldn't be happy producing a sub-par end product whether its my first or not.

the problem :

- sound must begin looping when the user presses down on the control
- the sound must stop when the user releases the control
- when moving the control up or down the sound effect must change pitch accordingly
- if the user doesn't remove there finger before backing out of the application it must plate the casing of there device with gold (Easter egg ;P)

now I'm aware of how monolithic the first 3 look and that's why I would really appreciate any help I can get.

sorry for how bad this code looks but my general plan is to create the functional components then refine the code later, no good painting the walls if the roofs not finished.

here's my user input, he set slide stuff is used in the graphics for the control

    @Override
    public boolean onTouchEvent(MotionEvent event)

    	//motion event for the screwdriver view

	    			//just goes into a method which sets a private variable in my sound pool class thing
	    			mSonicAudio.setPower(1, SonicPower);

thanks in advance, Matthew",android,,,,,,open,0,1081,8,"Complex sound handling (I.E. pitch change while looping) Hi everyone I've been meaning to learn Java for a while now (I usually keep myself in languages like C and Lua) but buying an android phone seems like an excellent time to start.

now after going through the lovely set of tutorials and a while spent buried in source code I'm beginning to get the feel for it so what's my next step? well to dive in with a fully featured application with graphics, sound, sensor use, touch response and a full menu.

hmm now there's a slight conundrum since i can continue to use cryptic references to my project or risk telling you what the application is but at the same time its going to make me look like a raving sci-fi nerd so bare with me for the brief...

A semi-working sonic screwdriver (oh yes!) my grand idea was to make an animated screwdriver where sliding the controls up and down modulate the frequency and that frequency dictates the sensor data it returns.
now I have a semi-working sound system but its pretty poor for what its designed to represent and I just wouldn't be happy producing a sub-par end product whether its my first or not.

the problem :

- sound must begin looping when the user presses down on the control
- the sound must stop when the user releases the control
- when moving the control up or down the sound effect must change pitch accordingly
- if the user doesn't remove there finger before backing out of the application it must plate the casing of there device with gold (Easter egg ;P)

now I'm aware of how monolithic the first 3 look and that's why I would really appreciate any help I can get.

sorry for how bad this code looks but my general plan is to create the functional components then refine the code later, no good painting the walls if the roofs not finished.

here's my user input, he set slide stuff is used in the graphics for the control

    @Override
    public boolean onTouchEvent(MotionEvent event) 
    {
    	//motion event for the screwdriver view
    	if(event.getAction() == MotionEvent.ACTION_DOWN)
    	{
        		//make sure the users at least trying to touch the slider
        		if (event.getY() > SonicSlideYTop && event.getY() < SonicSlideYBottom)
        		{
        			//power setup, im using 1.5 to help out the rate on soundpool since it likes 0.5 to 1.5
	    			SonicPower =  1.5f - ((event.getY() - SonicSlideYTop) / SonicSlideLength);
	    			
	    			//just goes into a method which sets a private variable in my sound pool class thing
	    			mSonicAudio.setPower(1, SonicPower);
	    			
	    			//this handles the slides graphics
        			setSlideY ( (int) event.getY() );
        			
        	
        @Override
    public boolean onTouchEvent(MotionEvent event)

I take EditText fields on this layout (i use the same layout to show my own profile which is editable) whose text is filled dynamically(e.g., data of clicked user is filled in this form).Since,  it only show me profile of concern user & i not need any editing on user data so i  disable editing on these edit text fields by calling this method on each one.

I have right a app, when you move your phone like a Bike race, then it will detect the motion and will choose a random voice of gare and then play it. Its working good on HTC. But when I try to run it on Samsung Galaxy Tab , It is not working properly. It play sound at start but when I try move it, then it play gare sound and then just silent? not play the Idle bike sound? I found that there is a erroe (38 , 0). I try my best to find a solution but failed. 

I am using .mp3 round in res/raw/ directory. **Can any one help?**

I have an app that takes input from the headset into an android device. I have been using the broadcast receiver and the media buttons. The problem I am now encountering is that on some motorola devices (originally noted in the RAZR but found somewhat in the others) the response time of the button was actually slower than the button could register, i.e. My samsung galaxy s3 can get response time < 150 milliseconds and the timeout for the gestures was set to 600 milliseconds. What I am finding is though that you can't register 3 button click on the razr any faster than 616 milliseconds (for myself). So the app was simply timing out instead of registering the commands. So the quick fix was for the timeout to be lengthened to 1 second but this still leaves razr users with a very lagging interaction with the app.

I can press the button however many times I want but when I am debugging and watching the button clicks I can tell with the razr there is a major problem, and in some other motorola phones there was some lag but not too much. It doesn't register the clicks at all if I go to fast. Would anyone know possibly what might cause this from a software perspective/any tips on how I might go about solving this. I have come to understand that the razr has documented problems with the headphone jack and I figured this could be a hardware error of some kind for the phone, or something of that nature.

I've noticed that my android app does support session by default so I did a little research about the HttpURLConnection and found this:

Sessions with Cookies

To establish and maintain a potentially long-lived session between client and server, HttpURLConnection includes an extensible cookie manager. Enable VM-wide cookie management using CookieHandler and CookieManager:
   CookieManager cookieManager = new CookieManager();
   CookieHandler.setDefault(cookieManager);
 
By default, CookieManager accepts cookies from the origin server only. Two other policies are included: ACCEPT_ALL and ACCEPT_NONE. Implement CookiePolicy to define a custom policy.
The default CookieManager keeps all accepted cookies in memory. It will forget these cookies when the VM exits. Implement CookieStore to define a custom cookie store.

In addition to the cookies set by HTTP responses, you may set cookies programmatically. To be included in HTTP request headers, cookies must have the domain and path properties set.

By default, new instances of HttpCookie work only with servers that support RFC 2965 cookies. Many web servers support only the older specification, RFC 2109. For compatibility with the most web servers, set the cookie version to 0.


but it's not compatible with the API level 8.

Now, I have few game, app ideas and I am sure they don't exist in iphone and android yet, and even browser based. Now , I want to develop those games in 5-6 months of time and I want users to be able to play from any platform, browser based, android, iphone, etc. just say like Zyanga poker. 

I can pretty much give the details of games and even come up with some algorithms and /or idea in most states. So, how much it will cost to develop such program? Should I learn and do programming myself? or should I use unity like program for cross-platform deployment? what about looking for some investors or giving share to programmers, if so, where can I find such possibilities?


Thanks..

I want to load some generated HTML into a WebView and have Javascript process it. In the past I've had great success with this. In testing a new JS library ([jsMath][1]) I was using a static page in very successfully, but when I switch to dynamic HTML it fails. The following example

	BufferedReader r = new BufferedReader(
		new InputStreamReader(getActivity().getAssets().open(""math.html"")));

	StringBuilder total = new StringBuilder();

screws up the rendering, while using

	wv.loadUrl(""file:///android_asset/math.html"");

works perfectly.

As an additional test I pasted a processed equation into the static HTML file (by inspecting the element in chrome) and that renders perfectly in both approaches. For some reason the JS processing seems to behave differently depending on my use of `loadDataWithBaseURL` versus `loadUrl`. I have played around with different encodings and mime types with no success. The HTML file definitely only contains ASCII characters.

Before trying to dig open the guts of the JS library, is there anything simple I'm missing?

I am new to Android development and want to know what is the best way to accomplish what I need, for example a combination of SurfaceViews, or just a View what container should they be a child of… things like that.  I am developing this on the XOOM Tablet... but it needs to work on all Honeycomb Android tablets.

[I have a sample screen prototype, but I don't have a high enough reputation to post it.]

Here is what I am looking for.  The main Activity that is going to be featured on this app needs to display 16 bitmaps in a 4x4 grid.  This grid needs to take up half or a little more that half of the left side of the screen.  The remaining portion of the screen will just have TextViews, Buttons, and other typical controls.

The catch is I want to be able to double click on one of these 16 images and have it animate to take up the entire space of the 16… effectively hiding the rest behind it as it comes to the foreground.  Then the user can double click on it again to animate back into its position in the grid.

Also I am going to be receiving data from a server over the wifi connection that might tell me I need to draw something on top of the bitmap.  For example my bitmaps are pictures of a football game and I may need to draw a new score or an icon or something on top of a game.  So I was thinking I could use 16 SurfaceViews, one for each game, but I tried ScaleAnimation and although the SurfaceView does resize, the bitmap drawn on it does not, and if I ask it what its size is or scaleX is after the ScaleAnimation is complete it tells me the original size, not the scaled size.  So that didn’t work for me.

I am open to ideas on how to lay this out and what combination of Views, or whatever would help me get this thing working.

Thanks for your help.

",android,android-camera,android-images,,,,open,0,2844,10,"How to capture an image in android with fixed size? I used the following code to capture image. Everything works fine, when i capture the image it has 2592x1944 size and the image is captured in landscape mode. Now i want to capture the image with the size of 534x534. I changed this parameter values `params.setPictureSize(534, 534);` Nothing will change. How can i do this. Thanks in advance.

I've searched the internet, stackoverflow, everything, times and times again, I've tried everything but now I'm getting desperate. 

I'm fairly new into android development, but I've developed enough to know the bare minimum of what I'm talking about. 

I was trying to do a simple app using the Google Tasks API. Something simple it's turning into a nightmare. Maybe it's something simple, probably it is, but I can't figure it out.

So the problem.

I was following the example of TasksSample.java from google but I can't compile even after [importing the libraries and dependencies required][2]. I'm using Google API Java Client version 1.5.0.

The problem it's when I access the GoogleAccessProtectedResource class. The import is import com.google.api.client.googleapis.auth.oauth2.draft10.GoogleAccessProtectedResource;

I always, and I mean always, no matter what code I have get the following error:

> 09-26 03:14:38.372: ERROR/dalvikvm(18731): Could not find class 'com.google.api.client.googleapis.auth.oauth2.draft10.GoogleAccessProtectedResource', referenced from method com.greven.test.google.tasks.GoogleTasksTake100Activity.<init>
09-26 03:14:38.402: ERROR/AndroidRuntime(18731): FATAL EXCEPTION: main
09-26 03:14:38.402: ERROR/AndroidRuntime(18731): java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: com.google.api.client.googleapis.auth.oauth2.draft10.GoogleAccessProtectedResource

I really can't see where the problem is. I imported all the needed .jars... I guess

As you can see in this picture the class is obviously imported: http://cl.ly/AQGC

I've searched the internet, stackoverflow, everything, times and times again, I've tried everything but now I'm getting desperate. 

I'm fairly new into android development, but I've developed enough to know the bare minimum of what I'm talking about. 

I was trying to do a simple app using the Google Tasks API. Something simple it's turning into a nightmare. Maybe it's something simple, probably it is, but I can't figure it out.

So the problem.

I was following the example of TasksSample.java from google but I can't compile even after [importing the libraries and dependencies required][2]. I'm using Google API Java Client version 1.5.0.

The problem it's when I access the GoogleAccessProtectedResource class. The import is import com.google.api.client.googleapis.auth.oauth2.draft10.GoogleAccessProtectedResource;

I always, and I mean always, no matter what code I have get the following error:

> 09-26 03:14:38.372: ERROR/dalvikvm(18731): Could not find class 'com.google.api.client.googleapis.auth.oauth2.draft10.GoogleAccessProtectedResource', referenced from method com.greven.test.google.tasks.GoogleTasksTake100Activity.<init>

I really can't see where the problem is. I imported all the needed .jars... I guess

As you can see in this picture the class is obviously imported: http://cl.ly/AQGC

So what other options do I have to fix this? Use Maven? I'm clueless now. I never thought I would have a problem like this. Oh I also tested on different computers, other google java api client (version 1.4) and same thing happend.

Obviously it's going to need the width to figure that out. I had overridden `onMeasure()` like so:

    @Override
    protected void onMeasure(int widthMeasureSpec, int heightMeasureSpec) {
      int widthSize = MeasureSpec.getSize(widthMeasureSpec);
      int lineWidth = widthSize - getPaddingLeft() - getPaddingRight();

      // Change the text size until the largest line of text fits.
      while (lineWidth < calculateTextWidth()) {
        for (TextView textView : this.childViews) {
          float newSize = textView.getTextSize() - 1;
          textView.setTextSize(TypedValue.COMPLEX_UNIT_PX, newSize);
        }
      }
    
      super.onMeasure(widthMeasureSpec, heightMeasureSpec);
    }

`calculateTextWidth()` calculates the width of the largest line of text, and everything works with that. This code is working fine for FILL_PARENT and WRAP_CONTENT widths, but screws up when I try to give the component a weight and let it auto-set its weight that way - `MeasureSpec.getSize(widthMeasureSpec)` returns 0, as does `getMinimumSuggestedWidth()`. This gives a wonderful Activity Not Responding error, since lineWidth will always be less than `calculateTextWidth()` would ever return, so the `while` loop runs forever. The XML code I used was this, essentially:

    <com.my.widgets.ScalingTextViewGroup
      android:layout_width=""0dp""
      android:layout_height=""wrap_content""
      android:layout_weight=""1""

I understand why it's returning 0 - obviously, it's being set to 0 - but how do I get it to use the layout_weight? I feel like it's something that should have a simple answer, but I'm at a loss as to what it is.",android,android-layout,custom-view,weight,,,open,0,536,7,"Handling weights in onMeasue for custom views I have a custom view that I'm creating that will scale the font size of its child `TextViews` to fit all in a set width, so each is on its own line. Obviously it's going to need the width to figure that out. I had overridden `onMeasure()` like so:

    @Override
    protected void onMeasure(int widthMeasureSpec, int heightMeasureSpec) {
      int widthSize = MeasureSpec.getSize(widthMeasureSpec);
      int lineWidth = widthSize - getPaddingLeft() - getPaddingRight();

      // Change the text size until the largest line of text fits.
      while (lineWidth < calculateTextWidth()) {
        for (TextView textView : this.childViews) {
          float newSize = textView.getTextSize() - 1;
          textView.setTextSize(TypedValue.COMPLEX_UNIT_PX, newSize);
        }
      }
    
      super.onMeasure(widthMeasureSpec, heightMeasureSpec);
    }

`calculateTextWidth()` calculates the width of the largest line of text, and everything works with that. This code is working fine for FILL_PARENT and WRAP_CONTENT widths, but screws up when I try to give the component a weight and let it auto-set its weight that way - `MeasureSpec.getSize(widthMeasureSpec)` returns 0, as does `getMinimumSuggestedWidth()`. This gives a wonderful Activity Not Responding error, since lineWidth will always be less than `calculateTextWidth()` would ever return, so the `while` loop runs forever. The XML code I used was this, essentially:

This behaviour does not occur in an emulator which leads me to think it's something device-related. I'm using a Samsung Galaxy Note to test this on (Android 2.3.6).

## Reproduction ##

For debugging purposes I've created a new project, added the tile.png to the drawable-nodpi folder, created bg_tile.xml in the drawable folder and set the background in the main.xml layout file to ""@drawable/bg_tile""

So far so good:

http://i.stack.imgur.com/FGrr1.png

Now I've copied the **main.xml** to **secondary.xml**, and created another activity which uses secondary.xml.

To open the secondary activity, I've added it to the onCreate of the main activity:

    @Override
    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.main);
        
        Intent activityIntent = new Intent(this, NoDPISecondaryActivity.class);
        this.startActivity(activityIntent);
    }



The secondary activity should be shown with the same tiled background as in the main activity, but instead it scales the drawable:

http://i.stack.imgur.com/9Xwwp.png


## What next? ##

It this just something Samsung related where I've got to learn to live with, or has anyone got a clue on what's going on and how to fix this behaviour? 

My observations:

 - Pressing ""back"" returns to the main activity which shows the tiled background correctly.

 - Also, the secondary activity shows correctly when I initiate it using a button with an OnClickListener

----------

I have a strange problem with SpringSource Tool Suite 2.9.1 Release and Subversive plugin, running on Windows 7 Home Premium x64. I'm trying to checkout an android project from an SVN repository.

Here's what I'm doing:

 1. `File > Import > SVN > Project From SVN`
 2. I fill in the path to my repository and check the HEAD revision
 3. I click `Finish`
 4. The project is found and the default option is `Check out as a project with the name specified`. I leave the name alone Set the Depth field to `Recursively` and again, select the HEAD revision.
 5. I click `Finish`
 6. A progress bar appears for a second just to show an error message:

        Checkout operation for 'https://(.....)/Android' failed.
        svn: Cannot create new file 'C:\workspace-sts-2.9.1.RELEASE\AppName \.svn\lock': System can not find the path specified 

When I retry and follow the steps from 1 to 6, another dialog appears. It says:

    This project already exists in the workspace 
    or there is a data folder in the checkout destination.

It allows me to select a folder to overwrite. When I do that, a similar but different error message is shown. It says:

    Checkout operation for 'https://(...)/Android' failed.
    0x0000000f: The folder 'C:\workspace-sts-2.9.1.RELEASE\AppName \.svn' is locked by some external process. Please unlock the folder and try to check out the project again.

What I've tried
----------

First, I opened the SVN Lock view to see if there were any locks created by the IDE. There were none. 

I restarted the computer, hoping it would solve the problem of any application locking the file but this does not seem to be the case.

After that, I created a new workspace in a different location and tried to check out the project in there. The result was the same.


Then, I attempted to change the version of SVN Kit. The situation persists in:

 1. SVN Kit 1.2.3
 2. SVN Kit 1.3.5
 3. Native Java HL 1.5.4
 4. Native Java HL 1.6.12

I thought that changing permissions to the directories of my workspace was worth giving a try. It didn't do the trick either.

Finally, I checked out the project in a different location, using Tortoise SVN and imported it into my workspace. I could run it (though some build path settings seemed to be missing) but it's not a solution. I can't possibly imagine working on the project simultaneously with a couple of people without the ability to commit/update/view history/resolve conflicts in my IDE.

I was advised to install a separate version of eclipse with its own set of tools and a different workspace for this application alone but it doesn't seem like a good idea. I'd like to keep it all in a single IDE. I'd also prefer to avoid reinstalling the whole thing as I don't feel like configuring all the other tools (mostly spring and android-related) from scratch.

Has anybody seen a situation like this? How can I get it working?",android,svn,windows-7,sts-springsourcetoolsuite,subversive,,open,0,508,13,"Can't checkout an android project in STS 2.9.1 and Subversive on Windows 7 The problem

I am assuming that once the development environment is set to desired level and state, programming would be as simple as Java programming.

The problem, then, is with ""developing"", that is getting your development environment configured properly, helping me program, rather than standing in the way, as is the current situation in my case.

Case 1 in question:

I have been trying to have a ""pure"" 64-bit development environment on Windows 7. It cannot be done. See the two threads here:

I understand that 64-bit development on Windows 7 is not officially supported but then the obvious question is why? Why can't Google catch up with Microsoft?

Case 2 in question:

Even on 32-bit Windows XP, the recommended development platform/tools for Android, behaves in an unpredictable manner (how can one project schedules like this?):

Unlike programming for Windows using Microsoft's tools which is very stable and very predictable, my experience with Eclipse + Android plugin + Android SDKs is that I never know what kind of a ""landmine"" is waiting for me around the corner...

So my question is: Why is that?

Is it because Eclipse is the alpha version of WebSphere (similar to how Fedora is the alpha for RHEL)?

Is it because Android plugins and SDKs are constantly in beta? (like Gmail used to be for many years)?

Is it because neither Eclipse nor Android tools & SDKs are adequately tested?

The problems arise when I try to rotate the device. After some struggle, I noticed that Android automatically recreates the previously added fragments like this:

SummaryFragment.onCreate(Bundle) line: 79	
FragmentManagerImpl.moveToState(Fragment, int, int, int) line: 795	
FragmentManagerImpl.moveToState(int, int, int, boolean) line: 1032	
FragmentManagerImpl.moveToState(int, boolean) line: 1014	
FragmentManagerImpl.dispatchCreate() line: 1761	
DashboardActivity(Activity).onCreate(Bundle) line: 864	
...
...

and then I recreate the fragments as usual. So I have the ""real"" fragments that I expect to work correctly and their ""hidden"" Android-created counterparts that make my app crash. How can I avoid this behavior? I already tried to call setRetainInstance(false) in the SummaryFragment.

Thank you

The problem I have is that the ad can't be clicked. No touch or click events are received by the WebView. When I remove the ListView and the WebView is the only child of the ViewGroup (by removing the last addView call), the ad is clickable and everything is fine.

ListViewContainer is a straightforward subclass of ListView that contains a load of clickable LinearLayouts.

Any help appreciated!

UPDATE: Should have pointed out, I am using the aChartEngine graphing library to add a PieChartView to a LinearLayout

I have a method

		 for (int color : colors) {
		 	 
			 SimpleSeriesRenderer r = new SimpleSeriesRenderer();
			 r.setColor(color);

which is called in onCreate() like so

    MyDataSource dataSource = new MyDataSource(this);
		dataSource.open();
		dataSet = new CategorySeries(""Analysis"");
		int i = 0;
		for(String category:categoriesArray){
			dataSet.add(category, dataSource.getTotalForCategory(category).getNumbers().doubleValue());
			colors[i]=listOfColours[i];
			i++;
		}
		dataSource.close();
		buildCategoryRenderer(colors);

and then in onResume()

    @Override

I have tried refreshing the project, cleaning the project, and fixing project properties and nothing seems to help.  Sometimes a couple will randomly show up in there, but not all of them.

The only consistent way I can get them to show up is to restart Eclipse.

Any ideas?

I have tried refreshing the project, cleaning the project, and fixing project properties and nothing seems to help.  Sometimes a couple will randomly show up in there, but not all of them.

The only consistent way I can get them to show up is to restart Eclipse.

Any ideas?

It looks/behaves like a custom list of some sort.
The left side looks like a TwoLineListItem (or just a large TextView and small TextView).
The right side is either a checkbox, a blank, or a downward arrow (like ExpandableListView) to indicate you should press it. (ex: when you press the Signature item, a dialog appears so you can input a signature).

I think one tricky part of this is that the entire list item is a ""button"", meaning you don't have to press directly on the checkbox to check it, you can press anywhere on the list item.

For example, section 5.2 of this tutorial [http://www.vogella.de/articles/AndroidListView/article.html][2] requires you tap exactly on the checkbox rather than on the entire list item.

Anyone have any ideas on how this is done?

I'm not asking someone to write this app, but merely give me some experienced ideas to what commands will be useful in setting up the texting home screen.  
My Checklist:  Strings of Phone numbers that will act as buttons that you can click on to text back,   scrollView to scroll down,  ListView(?)  list the string of numbers in.

I suppose that the byte array passed in

    public synchronized void onPreviewFrame(byte[] data, Camera camera)

contains the raw data images so I'm trying to convert it in a bitmap and save on the sdcard.
My questions are:

 1. is this the right path to fallow in order to achieve my target?
 2. I'm getting this error in the log SkImageDecoder::Factory returned null i suppose it is related at the bitmap conversion, is it right?

Any suggestions are welcome.
Thank you

2)use some packages I found on the web when the user can pay through paypal and google checkout account?

On the first case, I think it has more options (pay with credit card while in the app cannot), but I think that for example if the user has already selected an item in the app, and press ""complete the order"" then the whole site will open in the browser, he will have to choose items again and so on. So everything will have to be done through the browser and the app will be useless, am I right?

On the first case, I think it has more options (pay with credit card while in the app cannot), but I think that for example if the user has already selected an item in the app, and press ""complete the order"" then the whole site will open in the browser, he will have to choose items again and so on. So everything will have to be done through the browser and the app will be useless, am I right?

What do you suggest?",1

 - fragment's `onCreateView()` simply returns a new `FrameLayout`
 - fragment's `onActivityCreated()` gets the MapView from the Acitivity and adds it to its view hierarchy
 - `onDestroyView()` removes the MapView from its view hierarchy

Now I would like the fragment to use a layout defined in xml so that I can have some other UI stuff. Putting the `MapView` element in the layout file always crashes, so I'm doing it this way:

**map_screen_fragment.xml**

    <?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?>
    <LinearLayout xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android""

    </LinearLayout>

My `MapScreenActivity` holds the actual `MapView`, and the fragment calls `getMapView()`, so I don't run into the ""can't have more than one MapView"" issue:

**MapScreenActivity.java**

    public class MapScreenActivity extends FragmentActivity {
    	protected Fragment fragment;
    	protected MapView mapView;
    
    	@Override
    	protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    		super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    		setContentView(R.layout.single_pane_empty);
    
    		if (savedInstanceState == null) {
    			fragment = new MapScreenFragment();
    
    			getSupportFragmentManager().beginTransaction().add(R.id.root_container, fragment)
    					.commit();
    		}
    	}
    
    	public MapView getMapView() {
    		if (mapView == null) {
    			mapView = new MapView(this, getResources().getString(R.string.maps_api_key));
    		}
    		
    		return mapView;
    	}
    }

**MapScreenFragment.java**

    public class MapScreenFragment extends Fragment {
    	protected ViewGroup mapContainer;
    	protected MapView mapView;
    	
    	@Override
    	public View onCreateView(LayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container, Bundle args) {
    		View root = inflater.inflate(R.layout.map_screen_fragment, container);
    		mapContainer = (ViewGroup) root.findViewById(R.id.map_container);
    		return root;
    	}
    	
    	@Override
    	public void onActivityCreated(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    		super.onActivityCreated(savedInstanceState);
    		
    		mapView = ((MapScreenActivity) getActivity()).getMapView();
    		mapView.setClickable(true);
    		mapView.setBuiltInZoomControls(true);
    		
    		mapContainer.addView(mapView);
    		
    	}
    	
    	@Override
    	public void onDestroyView() {
    		super.onDestroyView();
    		mapContainer.removeView(mapView);
    	}

In theory, this should all work the same way as the `new FrameLayout` method first described. However, I get this every time:

Suppose I have a custom ImageView that I want to overlay over a background View (both within a RelativeLayout), which when touched, it erases the View's source bitmap, exposing the View below it. I've checked pretty much all of the threads and they suggest to use PorterDuff SRC Mode in the Paint object as well as creating a Canvas out out the ARGB_8888 shadow copy of the source bitmap to apply the masking. 

Also, I can't set the source of the overlay ahead of time since I have to download it over the network so that the ImageView's scale type takes care of the scaling for me.

Every time I override onDraw, when I apply the erase on the IV's Bitmap, it unveils a black background instead of the view below it, even though I set the background to transparent. So I'm at my last rope as to what to do in order to unveil the background view.

Here's what I have so far:


view constructor:

		paint.setStrokeWidth(STROKE_WIDTH);
		paint.setAntiAlias(true);

		super.setImageBitmap(bitmap);
		Drawable bd = getDrawable();
		if(bd == null){
			return;

		overlay = fullSizeBitmap.copy(Config.ARGB_8888, true);
        c2 = new Canvas(overlay);
	}

How could I make it so each instance of a widget that is created has it's own set of settings (The settings would be the same, just the values different)

So, for example - If I was making a weather application, then one instance of the widget could display the weather for one city and another widget could display the weather for another. Yet, you would still drag the same widget out.

I've thought of a few ways, but I'm just not sure how to go about making them happen. For example - I could use SharedPreferences and prefix each setting with the WidgetID. I am not sure if this would work though, and I have no idea how to get the widget id (I'm sure I could find out though.)

So what I am wondering is, is the above solution a good way to do what I am trying to achieve (and will it work) or is there a better way to go about doing this.

Im a newbie, I learn well by playing with code but cant write my own.

Essentially, im creating the following app:

Activity loads with a large character animating in a loop in middle of screen (no interaction, no position movement, essentially its just a character waving). you click a button and it loads a new activity with a new character animating (waving).

Now I have done this successfully using the aninationdrawable system.

However, each animation sequence uses 250x250 pixel png and there is about 30 pngs per character. This eats up a lot of resources and on low memory phones it seems to force close.

Questions:

1. Are those animations likely to be.causing the problem or is 250 x 250 pixel  with 20-30 image sequences likely to be causing the problem or am I barking up wrong tree?

2. I have looked for a better solution and tried lots of tutorials on sprite animation but not succeeding..does.anyone have any advice on how to go about it? I really need some basic code I can play with that will.animate one character in a very simple resource safe.manner.

I have created spritesheets instead of individual png images also so I can use spritesheet or individual files if necessary.

Thanks for any tips in the right directions! (written on phone, sorry for grammar errors)

What my program do:

 - displays a view(**main** layout) that allows user to enter some values(contains TextViews, EdiTexts, a  single Button)
 - when button is pressed, it contacts server and fetches data (HTTP POST - uses AsyncTask & get result)
 - now format this data(result from server) and display it in another layout(**output** layout)
 - when user presses back button, it goes back to main page(**main** layout) so to allow user to enter new data and fetch output from server again

What I have done:

 - i have created an activity called ""MyApp""
 - created two layouts - main & output
 - created button handler code for ""Submit"" button (of main layout) to start AsyncTask and to do HTTP posting and fetching of data
 - in onPostExecute(), i have written code to display **output** layout (`setContentView(R.layout.output);`) and to create TextViews in it and setText to set text.

After reading some articles i find i have to use separate activity to display output. Pass data from fetch operation of my main activity to second activity(output activity) and format it there and write code for button click handler to get back to main activity.
To send data from main activity to output activity, i should use `Bundle`. Correct ? Is anything to take care other than this ? Please guide me.",android,activity,,,,,open,0,220,10,"Is my logic correct? - main view and output view I am confused here.
