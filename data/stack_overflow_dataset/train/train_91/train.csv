There are many posts regarding this matter, but I'm still confused.

I understand that transmitting session information for static resources is dead weight, and want to eliminate this overhead. My confusion probably lies in whether implementing this scenario, is a configuration of the 

- client
- the server
- or both.

Suppose the user logs into a site (and the login details are stored in a cookie):

- In the HTTP packet, the cookie is set along with the page to render
- When the browser interprets the page, and encounters references to static resources in the header,
 - the browser generates new HTTP requests to fetch those resources 
 - and by default sends the cookie along with those requests
 - how could I instruct the browser not to do so for these resources?
		
The defacto method of implementing this scenario is to set up a 'static domain'. 

- Which is simply another domain or a sub-domain:
 - which could reference the resources in the original domain, or keep a duplicate
 - and would be void of any scripts, like an index.php
 - and would have an .htaccess to prevent directory browsing
- Is there crucial property of this 'static' subdomain that I'm missing?
  - What's up with the CNAME record?
  - Is there a way of configuring a domain to not accept cookies?
  - Even if there is, how would the browser know which domains to send cookies to, and which ones not to?
		
Lots of questions. I'm missing something crucial here. Hope someone can help.

In this project, you enter the weight of a box, and the percentage of materials held in that box. So for example, a box may have 10% of wood, 40% of plastic, and 50% of paper. The weights of the materials are held in the database as they dont change. So the value of 1% of wood is held in the database, as 1% of plastic and paper.

The controller should then take the percentage of material given, and then multiply it by the 1% value held in the database.

So far, this is my code:

    foreach($wastestream as $ws) { 
    		$genweight = $ws['Materialtype']['1pc'] * $ws['Valuegiven']['percent'];
    }

And this gives the following values:

    10% Wood = 97.5
    40% Plastic = 100.4
    50% Paper = 40.3

The problem I now have is that I have to add all of these variables together. So essentially what I want to do after it pumps out the values is to add them all up together, so:

    97.5 + 100.4 + 40.3 = 238.2

What should I do?

I am writing some code inside a framework for PHP 5.3, and I am trying to catch all errors in a way that will allow me to gracefully crash on client side and add some log entry at the same time. To be sure to also catch parse errors, I am using register_shutdown_function to specifically catch parse errors.

Here is the function that I register

    static function shutdown()
    {  
        if(is_null($e = error_get_last()) === FALSE)
          if($e[""type""] == E_PARSE)
            self::error($e[""type""], $e[""message""], $e[""file""], $e[""line""], array(self::$url));
    } 

The error method does two things : 

1. It adds an error entry to a log file using fopen in append.
2. It execute an error display: it explicitely sets the HTTP code to 500, and display a custom format 500 error page. Some include (which I do within a wapper class, but is only an include for now) are required from there

For some reason, I can fopen my log file and append, but cannot do a simple include; it just silently dies from there.

Here is what the log outputs if I add a Log entry for each includes

    static public function file($file)
    {
      if(class_exists(""Logs""))
        Logs::append(""errors.log"", $file . "":"" . ((include $file) ? 1 : 0));
      else
        include $file;
    }

    // Inside the Logs class...
    static public function append($file, $message)

      if(!is_scalar($message))

     fwrite($fh, $message.""\r\n"");

The php file that should recieve the data doesn't insert it to the table in my database. I've spent the past three days looking into tutorials and documentation on this forum, but I can't get it to work.

I'm following step by step this tutorial: http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/submit-a-form-without-page-refresh-using-jquery/

Following those steps I:

 1. Built a data base. 
 2. Setup an html document. 
 3. Styled it with CSS
 4. Retrieved the current comments using php, encoded the results
    into json, and parsed them with the getJson and .each functions. 
 5. Using jQuery, I attached to the ""add button"" a $.ajax function with the post method
 6. Wrote a php script to insert the submitted form into a table.



There is one difference between my table and the one in the tutorial:

The tutorial seems to have only two rows: 'name' and 'comment'.

Whereas mine has five rows:

'comment_id', 'commented_entry', name, 'comment', and 'date'.



This is the html:
  
    <div id=""content"">

      <button id=""add"">Add</button>  
    </div>  



This is the ajax call:

			//add click handler for button  
			$(""#add"").click(function() {  
			  
			  //define ajax config object  
			  var ajaxOpts = {  
				type: ""post"",

				  var div = $(""<div>"").addClass(""row"").appendTo(""#comments"");  
			  
				  //add author name and comment to container  
				  $(""<label>"").text($(""#leaveComment"").find(""input"").val()).appendTo(div);  
				  $(""<div>"").addClass(""comment"").text($(""#leaveComment"").find(""textarea"").val()).appendTo(div);  
				}  
			  };  
			  //alert(""clicked!"");
			  $.ajax(ajaxOpts);  
			});    

This is the php script:

    <?php  
		
      //db variables

     $database = ""the name of my database"";
     $hostname = ""localhost"";

      $server = mysql_connect($hostname, $username, $password);  
      $connection = mysql_select_db($database, $server);

      //add new comment to database  
      mysql_query(""INSERT INTO comments VALUES(' $name ',' $comment ')"");

The comment is added to the table when I click on the ""add"" button. However, when I look at my table in my database, no rows are added. Besides, the added comment disappears once I refresh the page.

**Now** my question is that where to install the sugar CRM. Do I need to install it on any other web server? Because in installation process it is written that copy all the files of sugar CRM to your root folder. Do I have to have to have an other server for this? If so then how to integrate it my web application.
