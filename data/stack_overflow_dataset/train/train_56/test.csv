In short: is GET / HEAD equivalent when requesting a file that has not changed?",http,header,if-modified-since,,,,open,0,70,11,"What response should If-Modified-Since HTTP Header return if request is HEAD? If you send a GET request with an If-Modified-Since header, the server suports it and the file hasn't changed, the server will return a 304 response.

If you sent a HEAD request in the same circumstances, should the server send a 304 response or send back the full headers you would have sent had the file changed?
