Please feel free to come make modifications and changes. Eventually I hope to post this on the Drupal handbook as well. Thanks. --Adrian

Sending automated e-mails from Drupal using Messaging and Notifications
===

To implement a notifications plugin, you must implement the following functions:

   * Use hook_messaging, hook_token_list and hook_token_values to create the messages that will be sent.
   * Use hook_notifications to create the subscription types
   * Add code to fire events (eg in hook_nodeapi)
   * Add all UI elements to allow users to subscribe/unsubscribe


Understanding Messaging
-----------------------

The Messaging module is used to compose messages that can be delivered using various formats, such as simple mail, HTML mail, Twitter updates, etc. These formats are called ""send methods."" The backend details do not concern us here; what is important are the following concepts:

TOKENS: tokens are provided by the ""tokens"" module. They allow you to write keywords in square brackets, [like-this], that can be replaced by any arbitrary value. Note: the token groups you create must match the keys you add to the $events->objects[$key] array.
   
MESSAGE KEYS: A key is a part of a message, such as the greetings line. Keys can be different for each send method. For example, a plaintext mail's greeting might be ""Hi, [user],"" while an HTML greeing might be ""Hi, <a href=""[user-url]"">[user]</a>,"" and Twitter's might just be ""[user-firstname]: "". Keys can have any arbitrary name. Keys are very simple and only have a machine-readable name and a user-readable description, the latter of which is only seen by admins.

MESSAGE GROUPS: A group is a bunch of keys that often, but not always, might be used together to make up a complete message. For example, a generic group might include keys for a greeting, body, closing and footer. Groups can also be ""subclassed"" by selecting a ""fallback"" group that will supply any keys that are missing. Groups are also associated with modules; I'm not sure what these are used for.


Understanding Notifications
---------------------------

The Notifications module revolves around the following concepts:

SUBSCRIPTIONS: Notifications plugins may define one or more types of subscriptions. For example, notifications_content defines subscriptions for:

   * Threads (users are notified whenever a node or its comments change)
   * Content types (users are notified whenever a node of a certain type is created or is changed)
   * Users (users are notified whenever another user is changed)

Subscriptions refer to both the user who's subscribed, how often they wish to be notified, the send method (for Messaging) and what's being subscribed to. This last part is defined in two steps. Firstly, a plugin defines several ""subscription fields"" (through a hook_notifications op of the same name), and secondly, ""subscription types"" (also an op) defines which fields apply to each type of subscription. For example, notifications_content defines the fields ""nid,"" ""author"" and ""type,"" and the subscriptions ""thread"" (nid), ""nodetype"" (type), ""author"" (author) and ""typeauthor"" (type and author), the latter referring to something like ""any STORY by JOE."" Fields are used to link events to subscriptions; an event must match *all* fields of a subscription (for all normal subscriptions) to be delivered to the recipient.

The $subscriptions object is defined in subsequent sections. Notifications prefers that you don't create these objects yourself, preferring you to call the notifications_get_link() function to create a link that users may click on, but you can also use notifications_save_subscription and notifications_delete_subscription to do it yourself.

EVENTS: An event is something that users may be notified about. Plugins create the $event object then call notifications_event($event). This either sends out notifications immediately, queues them to send out later, or both. Events include the type of thing that's changed (eg 'node', 'user'), the ID of the thing that's changed (eg $node->nid, $user->uid) and what's happened to it (eg 'create'). These are, respectively, $event->type, $event->oid (object ID) and $event->action.

> Warning: notifications_content_nodeapi also adds a $event->node field, referring to the node itself and not just $event->oid = $node->nid. This is not used anywhere in the core notifications module; however, when the $event is passed back to the 'query' op (see below), we assume the node is still present.

Events do *not* refer to the user they will be referred to; instead, Notifications makes the connection between subscriptions and events, using the subscriptions' fields. 

MATCHING EVENTS TO SUBSCRIPTIONS: An event matches a subscription if it has the same type as the event (eg ""node"") and if the event matches all the correct fields. This second step is determined by the ""query"" hook op, which is called with the $event object as a parameter. The query op is responsible for giving Notifications a value for all the fields defined by the plugin. For example, notifications_content defines the 'nid', 'type' and 'author' fields, so its query op looks like this (ignore the case where $event_or_user = 'user' for now):

	$event_or_user = $arg0;
	$event_type = $arg1;
	$event_or_object = $arg2;
	if ($event_or_user == 'event' && $event_type == 'node' && ($node = $event_or_object->node) ||
			$event_or_user == 'user'  && $event_type == 'node' && ($node = $event_or_object)) {
		$query[]['fields'] = array(
				'nid' => $node->nid,
				'type' => $node->type,
				'author' => $node->uid,
		);

		return $query;

After extracting the $node from the $event, we set $query[]['fields'] to a dictionary defining, for this event, all the fields defined by the module. As you can tell from the presence of the $query object, there's way more you can do with this op, but they are not covered here.


DIGESTING AND DEDUPING:


Understanding the relationship between Messaging and Notifications
------------------------------------------------------------------

Usually, the name of a message group doesn't matter, but when being used with Notifications, the names must follow very strict patterns. Firstly, they must start with the name ""notifications,"" and then are followed by either ""event"" or ""digest,"" depending on whether the message group is being used to represent either a single event or a group of events. 

For 'events,' the third part of the name is the ""type,"" which we get from Notification's $event->type (eg: notifications_content uses 'node'). The last part of the name is the operation being performed, which comes from Notification's $event->action. For example:

   * notifications-event-node-comment might refer to the message group used when someone comments on a node
   * notifications-event-user-update to a user who's updated their profile

Hyphens cannot appear anywhere other than to separate the parts of these words.

For 'digest' messages, the third and fourth part of the name come from hook_notification's ""event types"" callback, specifically this line:

	$types[] = array(
		'type' => 'node',
		'action' => 'insert',
		...
		'digest' => array('node', 'type'),
	);
	$types[] = array(
		'type' => 'node',
		'action' => 'update',
		...
		'digest' => array('node', 'nid'), 
	);      

In this case, the first event type (node insertion) will be digested with the notifications-digest-node-type message template providing the header and footer, likely saying something like ""the following [type] was created."" The second event type (node update) will be digested with the notifications-digest-node-nid message template.


$event
------

The $event object has the following members:

   * $event->type: The type of event. Must match the type in hook_notification::""event types"". {notifications_event}
   * $event->action: The action the event describes. Most events are sorted by [$event->type][$event->action]. {notifications_event}.
   * $event->object[$object_type]: All objects relevant to the event. For example, $event->object['node'] might be the node that the event describes. $object_type can come from the 'event types' hook (see below). The main purpose appears to be to be passed to token_replace_multiple as the second parameter. $event->object[$event->type] is assumed to exist in the short digest processing functions, but this doesn't appear to be used anywhere. Not saved in the database; loaded by hook_notifications::""event load""
   * $event->oid: apparently unused. The id of the primary object relevant to this event (eg the node's nid).
   * $event->module: apparently unused
   * $event->params[$key]: Mainly a place for plugins to save random data. The main module will serialize the contents of this array but does not use it in any way. However, notifications_ui appears to do something weird with it, possibly by using subscriptions' fields as keys into this array. I'm not sure why though.

hook_notifications
------------------

hook 'event types': returns an array of event types, with each event type being an array with the following members:

   * type: this will match $event->type
   * action: this will match $event->action
   * digest: an array with two ordered (non-keyed) elements, ""type"" and ""field."" 'type' is used as an index into $event->objects. They are also used to find the correct Messaging template; see discussion above.
   * description: used on the admin ""Notifications->Events"" page
   * name: unused, use Messaging instead
   * line: deprecated, use Messaging instead

Its a custom module and don't want to use other modules to achieve this, so these answers are useless : [http://drupal.stackexchange.com/questions/34011/help-needed-for-adding-and-edit-delete-link-in-a-column-in-a-view-table][1]


[I also found this website][2]

  [2]: http://public-action.org/content/drupal-7-form-api-modify-and-delete-record-operations-drupal-7-multi-step-form-fapi

but the description is way too complicated and I think the whole script is incomplete. 

I've also tried the http://drupal.org/project/examples but that didn't get me any further 


does anyone have really good examples or a complete working module? 

thanks for your input

- Documentation, Documentation, Documentatiooooon!!!! :)
- Community

I have some experience working in Drupal, but **I do enjoy a lot programming with Python**. I do know there is a lot of modules in Drupal that may ease my work, but I also heard bad opinions about the instability of some modules.

Drupal has a large community and acceptable documentation.

Right now, Simpletest, the Drupal testing framework works by installing and setting up the tables for every module needed for a test, which makes for slow tests, and I'm emulating a similar approach by loading a db dump for each test.

Given that a site, if you're doing integration testing has a 'known good' state to be starting from, I think it would be faster to be able to just revert back to that point each time, instead of waiting twenty seconds or so to drop the database then pipe the dumpfile back in between each test runs.

However, when I try diffing between two dumpfiles (ie `before.I.create.a.node.sql`, and `after.I.create.a.node.sql`) the output is an unreadable load of serialised php, that I can't make sense of.

Ae there any tools I can use to help work out which tables I need to drop and rebuild between test cases, so I don't incur the 20 second hit on each test, short of reading the schema and code of every module I'm working with?

I'm following the ideas outlined here with [getting cucumber to work with PHP][1], and yes, I have seen [this question here on a [similar subject][2]

I would like to use a framework that one could build skills on, one that is not overly complex, and one, that will still make me write code - the senior project is about my work, not about the work of the php community

I started with Kohana, yet, I didnt like it very much. Its poor documentation, and the frequent changes in the code base made me stop. 

I am thinking of something very small and sweet, something that doesn't show up in every step and say : ""hey you know what, I can do that better than you"" Something like CakePHP, maybe.

I know that more or less, all the code I need is available out there. However, the point here is just a little bit more academical.

Any suggestions ?",drupal,php,content-management-system,kohana,cakephp,07/12/2011 18:19:35,not constructive,1,222,9,"What PHP framework to choose for a Senior Project I am working on my senior project, and the topic that we agreed on was a CMS that similarly to Drupal would make things easier by providing robust administration capabilities

Content type and data field creation (CCK)
Views Creation
complex user management (tasks and roles)

I found code from the developers before me where they have ""pause"" api calls. I think the issue is the video module was upgraded because the older version was not showing HTML5 video on devices that didn't support flash. The updated fixed that issue but broke the pause functionality.

            // Pause any running videos in the current slide
            var $vimeo = $prevSlide.find('.media-vimeo iframe')
            
            if ($vimeo.length && 'api' in $vimeo.get(0)) {
              $vimeo.get(0).api('api_pause')
            }
            var $youtube = $prevSlide.find('.emvideo-youtube object')
            if ($youtube.length && 'pauseVideo' in $youtube.get(0)) {
              $youtube.get(0).pauseVideo()
            }

My guess is the code above isn't finding the object that it needs to call the api's any longer. I have not messed with drupal and vimeo and this drupal module enough to know what the solution should be. 

",drupal,vimeo,,,,,open,0,346,7,"javascript vimeo api with drupal media module I am working on a site that I didn't code. Also I am not a drupal user normally. I have a little better understanding than I did when I started the project.

The site uses a media module of some kid for embedding vimeo videos. The problem is when user navigates away from a video it is still playing. 

I found code from the developers before me where they have ""pause"" api calls. I think the issue is the video module was upgraded because the older version was not showing HTML5 video on devices that didn't support flash. The updated fixed that issue but broke the pause functionality.
