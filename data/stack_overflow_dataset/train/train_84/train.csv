Also: naming conventions, where to put Controller","I'm new to MVC although I've read a lot of papers and information on the web.  I know it's somewhat ambiguous and there are many different interpretations of MVC patterns.. but the differences seem somewhat minimal

My main question is - are M, V, and C always going to be necessary to be doing this right?  I haven't seen anyone address this in anything I've read.  Examples (I'm working in Cocoa/Obj-c although that shouldn't much matter)..

1) If I have a simple image on my GUI, or a text entry field that is just for a user's convenience and isn't saved or modified, these both would be V (view) but there's no M (no data and no domain processing going on), and no C to bridge them.  So I just have some aspects that are ""V"" - seems fine

2) I have 2 different and visible windows that each have a button on them labeled as ""ACTIVATE FOO"" - when a user clicks the button on either, both buttons press in and change to say ""DEACTIVATE FOO"" and a third window appears with label ""FOO"".  Clicking the button again will change the button on both windows to ""ACTIVATE FOO"" and will remove the third ""FOO"" window.  In this case, my V consists of the buttons on both windows, and I guess also the third window (maybe all 3 windows).  I definitely have a C, my Controller object will know about these buttons and windows and will get their clicks and hold generic states regarding windows and buttons.  However, whether I have 1 button or 10 button, my window is called ""FOO"" or my window is called ""BAR"", this doesn't matter.  There's no domain knowledge or data here - just control of views.  So in this example, I really have ""V"" and ""C"" but no ""M"" - is that ok?

  
3) Final example, which I am running in to the most.  I have a text entry field as my View.  When I enter text in this, say a number representing gravity, I keep it in a Model that may do things like compute physics of a ball while taking in to account my gravity parameter.  Here I have a V and an M, but I don't understand why I would need to add a C - a controller would just accept the signals from the View and pass it along to the Model, and vice versa.  Being as the C is just a pure passthrough, it's really ""junk"" code and isn't making things any more reusable in my opinion.  In most situations, when something changes I will need to change the C and M both in nearly identical ways.  I realize it's probably an MVC beginner's mistake to think most situations call for only V and M.. leads me in to next subject

4) In Cocoa / Xcode / IB, I guess my Controllers should always be an instantiated object in IB?  That is, I lay all of my ""V"" components in IB, and for each collection of View objects (things that are related) I should have an instantiated Controller?  And then perhaps my Models should NOT be found in IB, and instead only found as classes in Xcode that tie in with Controller code found there.  Is this accurate?  This could explain why you'd have a Controller that is not really adding value - because you are keeping consistent..

5) What about naming these things - for my above example about FOO / BAR maybe something that ends in Controller would be the C, like FancyWindowOpeningController, etc?  And for models - should I suffix them with like GravityBallPhysicsModel etc, or should I just name those whatever I like?  I haven't seen enough code to know what's out there in the wild and I want to get on the right track early on

5844833,04/30/2011 21:49:37,447632,09/14/2010 17:49:22,75,5,How to do a static initialization in Cocoa,"When you need to initialize a static variable in Java, you can do something like that:

    public class MyClass {

      private static Object someStaticObject;
      static {
        // initialize  someStaticObject here
      }
      ...

How can you do the same in Cocoa?

Specifically, here is what I am after: I have an app with a large number of user preferences.  I would like to manage all these preferences from one class where all methods are static, as follows:

@implementation Preferences

    +(void)setMotion:(BOOL)isMotion {
      [[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] setBool:isMotion forKey:keyIsMotion];
      [[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] synchronize];
    }

    +(BOOL)isMotion {
      [[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] boolForKey:keyIsMotion];
    }

So that I can access and set my preference easily anywhere in my code with:  

    [Preferences setMotion:TRUE];  

or  

    if ([Preferences isMotion]) {
      ...

Given that I plan to have tens of static methods, it would like to have a static variable defaults defined as follows:

    NSUserDefaults *defaults = [NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults];

so that my code above could become:

    +(void)setMotion:(BOOL)isMotion {
      [defaults setBool:isMotion forKey:keyIsMotion];
      [defaults synchronize];
    }

> *** -[DOiPadStoryboardViewController handleSliding:]: message sent to deallocated instance 0x238580

It must be something simple I am doing wrong. Why is the controller deallocated?

I create the storyboard with the following code:


    if (isIOS5) {
        // iOS 5 with storyboard
        UIViewController *viewControler = nil;
        if([self isiPad]){
            UIStoryboard *storyboard = [UIStoryboard storyboardWithName:@""iPadStoryboard"" bundle: [NSBundle mainBundle]];
            viewControler = [storyboard instantiateInitialViewController];
        } else {
            UIStoryboard *storyboard = [UIStoryboard storyboardWithName:@""iPhoneStoryboard"" bundle: [NSBundle mainBundle]];
            viewControler = [storyboard instantiateInitialViewController];
        }
        [self.window addSubview:viewControler.view];
    } 

The gesture recognizer is connected to the main view and the IBAction is in the view controller. The storyboard looks as follows (but not sure if this add anything):
![Storyboard][1]

and this is the Pan Gesture Recognizer:
![Gesture properties][2]

and finally the 'bt' console output:

 - Rendering the text in a separate overlay view (either a sub-view or super-view of the chart) that uses ""normal"" scaling?
 - Can I manipulate the font metrics to compensate for the scaling?

I noticed that someone with the same problem posted on the Xcode mailing list, but they got no real answer: http://www.cocoabuilder.com/archive/xcode/263804-debug-run-executable-does-nothing.html?q=%22no+value%22+standard+input#263804 .

In fact, let's say you're creating Quake, only it's 2011 and you'd prefer to only use modern, non-deprecated frameworks.

You want your game to be notified when the user presses (or releases) a key, *any key*, on the keyboard. This includes modifer keys, like shift and control.

You also want your game to have a config screen, where the user can inspect and modify the keyboard config. It should contain things like:

* Move forward: W
* Jump: SPACE
* Fire: CTRL

What do you do? I've been trying to find a *good* answer to this for a day or so now, but haven't succeeded.

This is what I've came up with:

* Subclass NSResponder, implement keyUp: and keyDown:, like in [this answer][1]. A problem with this approach, is that keyUp: and keyDown: won't get called when the user presses only a modifier key. To work around that, you can implement flagsChanged:, but that feels like a hack.
* Use a [Quartz Event Tap][2]. This only works if the app runs as root, or the user has enabled access for assistive devices. Also, modifier key events still do not count as regular key events.
* Use the HIToolbox. There is virtually no mention at all of it in the 10.6 developer docs. It appears to be very, very deprecated.

So, what's the proper way to do this? This really feels like a problem that should have a well-known, well-documented solution. It's not like games are incredibly niche.

There is a radio show that I love listening to. It comes on everyday and the podcasts are uploaded to a website so users can download and listen to them for free. The website isn't very navigable, however, and it's extremely hard to play the podcasts from my phone (and, therefore, my car).

Alternatively, if they didn't want it, I would just download the podcasts from the site and re-upload them to mine.

Please note I am not trying to make any money off this, I am only trying to make it easy for people like me (with long commutes) to enjoy this particular radio show without having to navigate the existing (dysfunctional) site- risking the lives of dogs, squirrels, and other drivers in the process.

I also have a custom view object that is bound to `contents` via an `NSArrayController`. In `observeValueForKeyPath:ofObject:change:context:` the only value in the change dictionary for the `NSKeyValueChangeKindKey` I ever see is `NSKeyValueChangeSetting`. When I'm adding objects to the array, I expect to see `NSKeyValueChangeInsertion`.

Longer version:

A view in my app contains some data fetched from a server.  When the app determines that the data is invalid, it fetches fresh information and displays it.  Usually the update happens too quickly to see, but if server or network problems cause the background job to take more than a second or two, I need to make sure the user 

1. Cannot interact with the view until the job is finished;
2. Can tell that the view is awaiting an update; and
3. Can continue to interact with other parts of the application until the job is finished.

1) is important because any operation initiated with the stale data will fail, and if the network or the server is slow, I don't want the user to waste his time with futile attempts to interact with that part of the application.  (It's fine if the user can still _see_ the data.  That could conceivably be helpful, actually, but it isn't crucial.)

What is the standard way to do this in Cocoa?  For what it's worth, in the Eclipse framework I think I used the `showBusy` method on `ViewPart`.  

If there isn't a standard way, does anyone have any suggestions for tackling it?  I haven't been using OS X very long, so I'm not even sure how an app is supposed to look and behave in this situtaion.  (The screenshots on this page looking promising, but it's iOS, not OS X:  http://cocoawithlove.com/2009/04/showing-message-over-iphone-keyboard.html)

Right now I'm working on replacing the whole view with an `NSProgressIndicator` and restoring the view after the task finishes, but removing the view means my app could end up in a funky state if something goes wrong.  Also, I'd like to be able to factor this functionality out into its own class or category(?) since I will have this issue with several different view classes in my application.  Ideally I'd like to end up with something as simple as Eclipse's view.showBusy(true)/view.showBusy(false).

Any and all help would be appreciated.
Thanks!",cocoa,nsview,,,,,open,0,364,7,"Marking a view as ""busy"" in Cocoa I'm writing a Cocoa app, and I need to indicate to the user that a view is invalid and can't respond until a background job is completed.  

Longer version:

A view in my app contains some data fetched from a server.  When the app determines that the data is invalid, it fetches fresh information and displays it.  Usually the update happens too quickly to see, but if server or network problems cause the background job to take more than a second or two, I need to make sure the user 

1. Cannot interact with the view until the job is finished;
2. Can tell that the view is awaiting an update; and
3. Can continue to interact with other parts of the application until the job is finished.

1) is important because any operation initiated with the stale data will fail, and if the network or the server is slow, I don't want the user to waste his time with futile attempts to interact with that part of the application.  (It's fine if the user can still _see_ the data.  That could conceivably be helpful, actually, but it isn't crucial.)

Also on specific action a custom semiopaque view appears over these 2 textfields. And then on other action, disappears.

When these texfields are covered with the semiopaque view I want them to become disabled and  my cursor not to change when it comes into the area of any of these textfields. And then I want them to become enabled when my custom view disappears.

I do it using the following commands:

    [fileNameField setEnabled:NO];
    [folderPathField setSelectable:NO];
    [folderPathField setEnabled:NO];

and 

    [fileNameField setEnabled:YES];
    [folderPathField setEnabled:YES];
    [folderPathField setSelectable:YES];

respectively.

The problem is that one called fileNameField does change correctly: it becomes a bit dimmed and doesn't either get selected or change my cursor when it is over the textfield.

But another one, folderPathField also becomes disabled, it isn't possible to select the text, but it still changes my cursor when it enters it's area. 

The only differences between these two textfields are:  
1. fileNameField has rounded border and folderPathField has no border.  
2. fileNameField has layout set to ""Scrolls"" and folderPathField - ""Truncates"".  

Does somebody know what can be the reason for such behaviour?

Any help is very appreciated.
