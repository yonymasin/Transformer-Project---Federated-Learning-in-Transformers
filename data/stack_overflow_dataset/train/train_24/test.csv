I am given a project which is very small project for small clinic which may be contains of five departments reception or registration and billing,pharmacy,store,laboratory,payroll so far ,

and as you know most of the operations for this project would be like CRUD operations if we will take first module as example :

for the first department ""Registration and billing ""
there will be form which contains the details of the patient and then the billing part will contain the entry fee and then if the patient goes to Dr then goes to pharmacy his details should be there in the pharmacy page where the medicine that he is going to buy will be added to his profile and then print the receipt .


My questions now are  :

1. Can apex do this project .
2. Can I use the bar code to get the product details.
3. Can I add figure print machine for the employees attendance .
4. Can I integrate apex with some pages from JSP in case if I have dynamic module needs more control driven mechanisms.

Questions related to apex with 11g XE and cloud :
1. Can I use apex and 11g xe for free and install them in server in my organization? If yes, so What are the limitations ?
2. If am going to deploy it on cloud shall they will use Oracle 11g XE or Oracle SE or EE, or it depends on my request ?
3. If I greed to start apex  and I would like to deploy it on cloud is there any requirements , like Do I have to first contact Oracle and ask them to give me the login to apex on cloud and work remotely , Or 
Can first develop it here in my machine and then contact oracle and deploy it on cloud .

If apex is not recommended for such projects please tell me before I start , and I will replace it with Java EE6

http://www.oracle.com/technology/oramag/oracle/09-may/o39security.html

The only difference is that my master SSO login is in Perl, rather than another APEX app. It sets an SSO cookie, and the app can check if it's valid with a database procedure.

I have noticed that when I arrive in the morning, the whole system doesn't work. I reload a page from the APEX app, it then sends me to the SSO page because the session was expired, I logon, and get redirected back to my original APEX app page. This usually works except first thing in the morning. It seems the APEX session is expired. In that case it seems to find the session, but then refuse to use it, and sends me back to the login page.

I've tried my best to trace the problem. The ""wwv_flow_custom_auth_std.is_session_valid"" function returns true, so I'm assuming the session is valid. But nothing works until I remove the APEX session cookie. Then I can log back in easily.

Anybody knows if there is another call that would tell me if the session is expired or not?

Thanks",oracle,apex,sso,,,,open,0,188,10,"How to find if an Oracle APEX session is expired I have created a single-sign-on system for our Oracle APEX applications, roughly based on this tutorial:

http://www.oracle.com/technology/oramag/oracle/09-may/o39security.html

The only difference is that my master SSO login is in Perl, rather than another APEX app. It sets an SSO cookie, and the app can check if it's valid with a database procedure.

I have noticed that when I arrive in the morning, the whole system doesn't work. I reload a page from the APEX app, it then sends me to the SSO page because the session was expired, I logon, and get redirected back to my original APEX app page. This usually works except first thing in the morning. It seems the APEX session is expired. In that case it seems to find the session, but then refuse to use it, and sends me back to the login page.

Do I need to install Oracle client or Server. Is Oracle 10g a good choice? Any tutorial or links for Oracle will be of great help.
