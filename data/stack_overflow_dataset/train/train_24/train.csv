Clearly, that isn't the case. Would anyone happen to have an explanation for this little bit of bizarreness? 

It's taking a whole lot of self-control at the moment to restrain myself from hurling the Oracle server out the window. Oracle seems *rife* with these kinds of inanities.

this query's result is,

    t_id  a

     3    3
     4    3
     5    3
     6    3
which is very weird,
take t1.t_id=1 for example,

    select count(t_name)
     from (select t2.t_name 
             from t_test t2 
             where t2.t_id=1
             group by t2.t_name)
the result is 1,
somehow,the 'where' operator doesn't work,the result is exactly the same as I put my query like this:

    select t1.t_id,
           (select count(t_name)
             from (select t2.t_name 
                     from t_test t2 
                     group by t2.t_name)) a

The first calculates Easter Sunday based on an algorithm from http://www.assa.org.au/edm.html. The second generates all other public holidays and inserts them into the table.

I just had to write this for work and don't want it to go to waste. The following is a PL/SQL script to generate statutory public holidays in the state of Victoria, Australia according to the Public Holidays Act 1993. It creates a table and 2 functions. The first calculates Easter Sunday based on an algorithm from http://www.assa.org.au/edm.html. The second generates all other public holidays and inserts them into the table. Please feel free to copy and port to any language. However, while I have unit tested this myself, please don't threaten to sue me if you use this without performing thorough testing yourself.

I hope this helps someone.

When I need to make changes to the view, I use Toad's ""describe objects"" window, where I can find a script to recreate the view. The only problem is that all my formatting is gone. Comments before the select keyword (but after ""create view xxx as"") will also disappear.

This question may be Toad specific. I have no idea how Oracle stores views, so I'll explain what happens when I use Toad. If I get an answer that is Oracle specific, so much the better. 

I have created a rather complex view. To make it clearer, I have formatted the code nicely, and entered some comments where needed. When I need to make changes to the view, I use Toad's ""describe objects"" window, where I can find a script to recreate the view. The only problem is that all my formatting is gone.

I have a Windows service that stores data in an Oracle database periodically. The table where this data is being stored is partitioned by date (Interval-Date Range Partitioning). The database also has a dbms_scheduler job that, among other operations, truncates and drops older partitions. 

This approach has been working for some time, but recently I had an [ORA-00054][1] error. After some investigation, the error was reproduced with the following steps:

 1. Open one sqlplus session, disable auto-commit, and insert data in the
    partitioned table, *without committing* the changes;
 2. Open another sqlplus session and truncate/drop an old partition (DDL
    operations are automatically committed, if I’m not mistaken). We
    will then get the ORA-00054 error.

There are some constraints worthy to be mentioned:

 - I don’t have DBA access to the database;
 - This is a legacy application and a complete refactoring isn’t
   feasible;

So, in your opinion, is there any way of dropping these old partitions, without the risk of running into an ORA-00054 error and without the intervention of the DBA? I can just delete the data, but the number of empty partitions will grow everyday.

I can confirm that the username and password are correct by logging in via SQLPlus or (to prove the JDBC connection is OK) via SQuirreL.

I have checked in Oracle that the new user has all the system privs that the existing user has.

WebSphere tells me to check the JVM logs, but they do not log anything during this operation. I have grepped all websphere logs and they do not mention my connection at all.

",oracle,like-operator,indexing,oracle10g,,,open,0,376,10,"Oracle query using 'like' on indexed number column, poor performance. On Query 1 a full table scan is being performed even though the id is an indexed column. Query 2 achieves the same result but much faster. If Query 1 is run returning an indexed column then it returns quickly but if non-indexed columns are returned or the entire row is then the query takes longer. 

In Query 3 it runs fast but the column 'code' is a VARCHAR2(10) in stead of a NUMBER(12) and is indexed the same way as 'id'.

Why does Query 1 not pick up that it should use the index? Is there something that should be changed to allow indexed number columns to perform quicker?

There are at least three ways to do that:

1. I can put the second query into a PL/SQL function<br>This adds more SQL-PL/SQL context switching and an additional query for each row, but concatenates only when necessary.

1. I can `LEFT JOIN` the query for value3 as sub-query<br>This will do the concatenation for every row, also if `a.value3` is not null.

1. I can group the whole query by all the values except for `value3`.<br> This would make the query much harder to read and maintain.

What is the best way to do it? Any tips?

It joins quite a view tables and returns lots of columns, but indexes are in place and performance is fine.

Now I want to add another column to the result, showing

* comma-separated values
* ordered by value
* from table y
* outer joined via intersection table x
* if `a.value3 IS NULL`, else take `a.value3`

To comma-separate the grouped values I use [Tom Kyte's stragg][1], could use [`COLLECT`][2] later.

Pseudo-code for the SELECT would look like that:

    SELECT xx.id, COALESCE( a.value3, stragg( xx.val ) ) value3
    FROM (
      SELECT x.id, y.val

In attempting to write a script to modify a column to nullable, I ran into the lovely ORA-01451 error:

This is happening because the column is already NULL.  We have several databases that need to be udpated, so in my faulty assumption I figured setting it to NULL should work across the board to make sure everybody was up to date, regardless of whether they had manually set this column to nullable or not.  However, this apparently causes an error for some folks who already have the column as nullable.

How does one check if a column is already nullable so as to avoid the error?  Something that would accomplish this idea:

The choice will likely have implications across several departments and projects.

The obvious choice is Hudson or Jenkins.  In the process of performing my due diligence, after reading several threads, blogs, news articles, etc leading up to the Hudson/Jenkins fork and beyond, one issue seems to be constantly repeated.  Hudson users were/are concerned about Oracle's involvement in the project.  Numerous references, however, keep indicating that Hudson was donated to the Eclipse Software Foundation, and that the ongoing development of Hudson is being spearheaded by Sonatype.

So that brings me to my question.  I know Sonatype as the kings of Maven due to their Maven/Nexus development, but have been trying to understand the relationship between Sonatype and Oracle.  I have not found anything indicating a link between the two companies (as in a joint-venture, or a shared ownership, or shared BODs, etc) except for Hudson.

Does anyone know if there is any official connection between the two?  If not, why/what would have prompted Oracle to ""hire"" Sonatype to handle Hudson?  In my mind, there seems to be a missing link somewhere that I cannot find.
