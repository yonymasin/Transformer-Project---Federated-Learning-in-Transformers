Disabled ASP.NET validators are losing their `InnerHTML` content when posted-back to the server, and then when enabled (locally via JavaScript) show the `ErrorMessage` rather than original `InnerHTML` when fired.

**More Details:**  
I deal with some complex forms that require lots of individual controls to be visible/invisible, and their validators to be enabled/disabled, depending on the selection of other controls.  

All the validators contain an single ""asterisk"" image, with the error message shown via the central `asp:ValidatorSummary` object. For instance (formatted for viewing here, normally there is no whitespace)...

    <asp:RequiredFieldValidator runat=""server"" ID=""valName"" 
      ControlToValidate=""txtName"" ErrorMessage=""Enter a name"">
        <img runat=""server"" src=""~/images/error.gif"" />
    </asp:RequiredFieldValidator>

Rather than use `asp:CustomValidator` on every single validator (which requires local JavaScript and server-side handlers for each), I simply set `.enabled = false` on normal validators as part of the event handler for the ""parent"" control.  (The status of the controls is also set on the server-side on the initial page load, as well as subsequent post-back page loads.)

    function showName(show){
      document.getElementById(""txtName"").style.display = (show ? """" : ""none"");
      document.getElementById(""valName"").enabled = show;
    }

The problem lies in the sequence of events where a validator is disabled, the form is posted-back... then a control is changed (via user interation) and the validator is enabled.  If the validator now fails (on an attempted post-back) the `<img` code has gone, so instead it displays the `ErrorMessage` text where the image should be.

The `InnerHTML` remains as long as the validator stays enabled.

Other than dynamically adding the image to each validator on every single page load (which I *really* don't want to do), or converting them all to `CustomValidator`s (which again I *really* don't want to do), does anybody know any way around this?  Is this a known bug (because I can't find anything obvious)?

I can't get it for anything in App_Code. Which would make sense if opened as ""Web Application"". But its created and opened as ""website"" 

So here is what works: 
(1) Open ""new Website"" --> Go to existing site directory --> Get prompt that it exists --> Select ""open existing website"" --> I get intellisense. 

(2) Close VS, use solution file from above, no intellisense. 
 
(3) Close VS, Open same site as ""Open Website"" --> No intellisense.

Any ideas why my settings won't stick. I tried to take setting from a Virtual Machine where it works when opening existing website. No luck. 

Tried to reset settings. No luck. 

Reinstalled VS.

And have this jQuery code POSTing to the controller:

               jQuery.ajax({
                    type: 'POST',
                    url: '/Config/UpdateLanguagePreference',
                    contentType: 'application/json; charset=utf-8',
                    data: '{ ""languageTag"": ""' + selectedLanguage + '"" }'
                });

When I try to the code, however, I get the error:

    Server Error in '/' Application.
    Value cannot be null.
    Parameter name: languageTag

What's the problem? Isn't this how to POST JSON to an MVC Controller? I can examine the POST using Fiddler and see that the request is correct. For some reason, `UpdateLanguagePreference()` is getting a null or empty string. ",4

* `row[""date""]` returns `null`.
* `row[11]` returns data.

* `row[row.Table.Columns[""date""]]` returns `null`.

Can anyone suggest why this might be happening?

Long Details follow:
Imagine an ASP.NET MVC application, where the controller talks to an ADO.NET DataService that encapsulates the storage of our models (for example sake we'll be reading a list of Customers). With a reference to the service, we get a generated class inheriting from DataServiceContext:

    namespace Sample.Services
    {
      public partial class MyDataContext : global::System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceContext
      {
        public MyDataContext(global::System.Uri serviceRoot) : base(serviceRoot) { /* ... */ }
        
        public global::System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceQuery<Customer> Customers
        {
          get
          {
            if((this._Customers==null))
            {
              this._Customers = base.CreateQuery<Customer>(""Customers"");
            }
            return this._Customers;
          }
        }
        /* and many more members */
      }
    }

The Controller could be:

    namespace Sample.Controllers
    {
      public class CustomerController : Controller
      {
        private IMyDataContext context;
        
        public CustomerController(IMyDataContext context)
        {
          this.context=context;
        }
        
        public ActionResult Index() { return View(context.Customers); }
      }
    }

As you can see, I used a constructor that accepts an IMyDataContext instance so that we can use a mock in our unit test:

    [TestFixture]
    public class TestCustomerController
    {
      [Test]
      public void Test_Index()
      {
        MockContext mockContext = new MockContext();
        CustomerController controller = new CustomerController(mockContext);
        
        var customersToReturn = new List<Customer>
        {
          new Customer{ Id=1, Name=""Fred"" },
          new Customer{ Id=2, Name=""Wilma"" }
        };
        mockContext.CustomersToReturn = customersToReturn;
        
        var result = controller.Index() as ViewResult;
        
        var models = result.ViewData.Model;
        
        //Now we have to compare the Customers in models with those in customersToReturn,
        //Maybe by loopping over them?
        foreach(Customer c in models) //*** LINE A ***
        {
          //TODO: compare with the Customer in the same position from customersToreturn
        }
      }
    }

MockContext and MyDataContext need to implement the same interface IMyDataContext:

    namespace Sample.Services
    {
      public interface IMyDataContext
      {
        DataServiceQuery<Customer> Customers { get; }
        /* and more */
      }
    }
    
However, when we try and implement the MockContext class, we run into problems due to the nature of DataServiceQuery (which, to be clear, we're using in the IMyDataContext interface simply because that's the data type we found in the auto-generated MyDataContext class that we started with). If we try to write:

    public class MockContext : IMyDataContext
    {
      public IList<Customer> CustomersToReturn { set; private get; }
      
      public DataServiceQuery<Customer> Customers { get { /* ??? */ } }
    }
    
In the Customers getter we'd like to instantiate a DataServiceQuery<Customer> instance, populate it with the Customers in CustomersToReturn, and return it. The problems I run into:

**1~** DataServiceQuery<TElement> has no public constructor; to instantiate one you should call CreateQuery<T> on a DataServiceContext; see [MSDN](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc646677.aspx) 

**2~** If I make the MockContext inherit from DataServiceContext as well, and call CreateQuery<T> to get a DataServiceQuery to use, the service and query have to be tied to a valid URI and, when I try to iterate or access the objects in the query, it will try and execute against that URI. In other words, if I change the MockContext as such:

    namespace Sample.Tests.Controllers.Mocks
    {
      public class MockContext : DataServiceContext, IMyDataContext
      {
        public MockContext() :base(new Uri(""http://www.contoso.com"")) { }
        
        public IList<Customer> CustomersToReturn { set; private get; }
      
        public DataServiceQuery<Customer> Customers
        {
          get
          {
            var query = CreateQuery<Customer>(""Customers"");
            query.Concat(CustomersToReturn.AsEnumerable<Customer>());
            return query;
          }
        }
      }
    }

Then, in the unit test, we get an error on the line marked as LINE A, because http://www.contoso.com doesn't host our service. The same error is triggered even if LINE A tries to get the number of elements in models.
Thanks in advance.

        public MyDataContext(global::System.Uri serviceRoot) : base(serviceRoot) { /* ... */ }
        
        public global::System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceQuery<Customer> Customers
        {
          get
          {
            if((this._Customers==null))
            {
              this._Customers = base.CreateQuery<Customer>(""Customers"");
            }
            return this._Customers;
          }
        }
        /* and many more members */
      }
    }

The Controller could be:

    namespace Sample.Controllers
    {
      public class CustomerController : Controller
      {
        private IMyDataContext context;
        
        public CustomerController(IMyDataContext context)
        {
          this.context=context;
        }
        
        public ActionResult Index() { return View(context.Customers); }
      }
    }

As you can see, I used a constructor that accepts an IMyDataContext instance so that we can use a mock in our unit test:

    [TestFixture]
    public class TestCustomerController
    {
      [Test]
      public void Test_Index()
      {
        MockContext mockContext = new MockContext();
        CustomerController controller = new CustomerController(mockContext);
        
        var customersToReturn = new List<Customer>
        {
          new Customer{ Id=1, Name=""Fred"" },
          new Customer{ Id=2, Name=""Wilma"" }
        };
        mockContext.CustomersToReturn = customersToReturn;
        
        var result = controller.Index() as ViewResult;
        
        var models = result.ViewData.Model;
        
        //Now we have to compare the Customers in models with those in customersToReturn,
        //Maybe by loopping over them?
        foreach(Customer c in models) //*** LINE A ***
        {
          //TODO: compare with the Customer in the same position from customersToreturn
        }
      }
    }

MockContext and MyDataContext need to implement the same interface IMyDataContext:

    namespace Sample.Services
    {
      public interface IMyDataContext
      {
        DataServiceQuery<Customer> Customers { get; }
        /* and more */
      }
    }
    
However, when we try and implement the MockContext class, we run into problems due to the nature of DataServiceQuery (which, to be clear, we're using in the IMyDataContext interface simply because that's the data type we found in the auto-generated MyDataContext class that we started with). If we try to write:

    public class MockContext : IMyDataContext
    {
      public IList<Customer> CustomersToReturn { set; private get; }
      
      public DataServiceQuery<Customer> Customers { get { /* ??? */ } }
    }
    
In the Customers getter we'd like to instantiate a DataServiceQuery<Customer> instance, populate it with the Customers in CustomersToReturn, and return it. The problems I run into:

**1~** DataServiceQuery<TElement> has no public constructor; to instantiate one you should call CreateQuery<T> on a DataServiceContext; see [MSDN](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc646677.aspx) 

**2~** If I make the MockContext inherit from DataServiceContext as well, and call CreateQuery<T> to get a DataServiceQuery to use, the service and query have to be tied to a valid URI and, when I try to iterate or access the objects in the query, it will try and execute against that URI. In other words, if I change the MockContext as such:

    namespace Sample.Tests.Controllers.Mocks
    {
      public class MockContext : DataServiceContext, IMyDataContext
      {
        public MockContext() :base(new Uri(""http://www.contoso.com"")) { }
        
        public IList<Customer> CustomersToReturn { set; private get; }
      
        public DataServiceQuery<Customer> Customers
        {
          get
          {
            var query = CreateQuery<Customer>(""Customers"");
            query.Concat(CustomersToReturn.AsEnumerable<Customer>());
            return query;
          }
        }
      }
    }

Then, in the unit test, we get an error on the line marked as LINE A, because http://www.contoso.com doesn't host our service. The same error is triggered even if LINE A tries to get the number of elements in models.
Thanks in advance.

This seems fine for migrating AppSettings type configuration settings. However, what about settings in system.web, system.webServer and system.webService or other more complex configuration systems. If I want to be able to modify my WCF configuration settings my current options are:

 1. Make the change and do a full deploy (build, upload to staging, switch VIP)
 2. Extend WCF thru a custom behavior or whatnot to use the Service Config (cscfg) instead.

I thought maybe I was misunderstanding the use - like the examples were simply the very naive case and that in practice they were used differently. However, after googling for a while it seems that this is exactly how everyone is doing it. For example, instead of using the connectionStrings configuration element for Entity Framework connections I have to [write a custom connection factory][1].

This not only seems like too much work, but it ties my entire configuration implementation to Azure. Yes, I can use an interface so I can abstract the details and replace the implementation if I need to. But I still don't like all the extra work, connectionStrings are simple, but there are much more complex things to override.

What I'm thinking is that I should be able to do is read the Service Configuration at startup and use the ConfigurationManager to update my web.config. If something changes at runtime then again, I can update web.config. This way my application is still portable and I'm not hardwired to the Azure configuration system. 

Does anyone agree? Or is it just me?

In my application I create several `CheckBoxList`controls programmatically. I do not know in advance how many `CheckBoxList` are created at runtime but I know their IDs. 

Now everytime a `CheckBox` of a specific `CheckBoxList` is checked the `ItemCheck` event is raised and I can use a event handler to perform some operations (mainly queries). Of course the operation to perform does not depend just on the `CheckBox` but also on the `CheckBoxList` selected.

Now I have the following options:

 1. When I create a `CheckBoxList` I can also programmatically create its **event handler** (I guess it is possible)

 2. Create a single event handler for all the `CheckBoxList` controls and use `Object sender` and `ItemCheckEventArgs e` to understand which `CheckBoxList` and `CheckBox` were checked (how do I link all these controls to a single event handler)?

Is my reasoning correct? Is there any other better option to perform this task? If it is not the case, which one is the right approach to choose? Thanks

But our exception handling code gets the DomainException again - I can only assume the DomainDataSource control has cached the result as being an exception, and just throws it without sending a request to the server. 

If we enter a different search parameter, then the query is re-executed no problem.

Can anyone help?",4

Would it be better to use Panels that load the User Controls and then show or hide the Panels (visible=true/false) or would it be better to use a PlaceHolder and load (add) or unlaod(clear) them at runtime (LoadControl())?

a) I have a page that uses AJAX UpdatePanel.  The page has 10 Panels, each Panel loads a User Control.  In code behind I make the a Panel visible or invisible, only show one at a time.  This solution is simple, as all the User Controls are in the page, it's easy to refer to them and their internal controls.

b) Loading controls dynamically using LoadControl seems a bit more complicated.

but the problem is that it is still showing hand icon on it when mouse over those buttons,

Unfortunately, this also means that I've become acutely aware of my performance shortfalls, the most prevalent of which is the amount of time it takes me to develop, test, and submit algorithms for review.

A great example of what I'm talking about occurred this week when I was tasked with developing a simple XML web service (asp.net 3.5) callable via client-side JavaScript, that accepts a single parameter and returns a dataset output to a modal window  (please note this is the first time I've had to develop a web service and have had ZERO experience creating/consuming them...let alone calling them from JS client side).  

Keeping a long story short -- I worked on it for 4 days straight, all day each day, for a grand total of 36 hours, not including the time I spent dwelling on the problem in the shower, the morning commute, and laying awake in bed at night.  I learned a great deal about web services and xml/json/javascript...but was called in for a management review to discuss the length of time it took me to develop the solution.

In the meeting, I was praised for the quality of my work and was in fact told that my effort was commendable.  However, they (senior leads and pm's) weren't impressed with the amount of time it took me to develop the solution and expressed that they would have liked to see the solution in roughly 1/3 of the time it took me.

I guess what concerns me the most is that I've identified this pattern as common for myself.  Between online videos, book research, and trial/error coding...if its something I haven't seen before, I can spend up to two weeks on a problem that seems to only take the pros in the videos moments to code up.  And of course, knowing that management isn't happy with this pattern has shaken me up a bit.

To sum up, I have some very specific questions I'd like to ask, and would greatly appreciate your objective professional feedback.

1. Is my experience as a junior programmer common among new developers?  Or is it possible that I'm just not cut out for the work?

2. If you suspect that my experience is not common and that there may be an aptitude issue, do you have any suggestions/solutions that I could propose to management to help bring me up to speed?

3. Do seasoned, professional programmers ever encounter knowledge barriers that considerably delay deliverables?

4. When you started out in the industry, did you know how to ""do it all""?  If not, how long did it take you to be perceived as ""proficient""?  Was it a natural progression of trial and error, or was there a particular zen moment when you knew you had achieved super saiyen power level?


Anyways, thanks for taking the time to read my question(s).  I don't know if this is the right place to ask for professional career guidance, but I greatly appreciate your willingness to help me out.

It has been a while already since some of us have enjoyed the new MVC framework for ASP.NET. We have talked about it, compared them, liked or disliked one or the other at a different point of time, argued about them each protecting his own point of view. Now it is somewhat silent. He who wanted to give it a try has already done so.

I believe that this MVC approach (though it is not new I know, bear with me) has been quite an eye-opening for those of us who had been hacking WebForms and windows-like event handling. I must admit I have come to realize how wrong WebForms really were, though I didn't want to believe it until the last moment.

Two main differences that going with MVC can bring:

1) Developer will finally (if he hasn't done so already) get his hands dirty with learning HTML, CSS design, JavaScript techniques, HTTP and how web applications really work underneath

2) During the painful (probably) adoption of this MVC approach the guy will probably give a lot of thoughts to the architecture issues, concern separation, n-tier architecture etc. which on its own is good already because many coders just hack it the cowboy way without thinking first

After some time the guy will probably form an opinion about what he prefers and considers the right way and most especially why. At this point don't start kicking me about good old WebForms - I know they are good and actually much better for certain scenarios, but it is also an opinion.

So, I suppose asking a guy which of the two he personally prefers and asking him to describe the advantages of his choice could be a good test of where he stands.

3. Another problem is when a value in the select box users is clicked the focus will not leave. I add the users on click in the select box in the method that i called. But when the form is refresh the select box has the focus that i dont want. Is it possible to do deselected on refresh?

He says that it is giving him an alert with 16146 in it, I can't fix it because I can't even duplicate it.

I have customErrors defined within web.config, everything is going to the same concise error page.  I kind of get how you COULD exploit this file but I just want to know what I managed to do that causes it to come across text.

HELP?!?

1. Convert 1.wav and 2.wav to binary, then remove the headers (first 44 bytes of each).
2. Stitch together the remaining data from 1.wav and 2.wav into a Byte() Array.
3. Create a new header for the combined WAVs.
4. Write the combined Byte() Array (step 2) to a new WAV file '3.wav', adding the newly created header (step 3) to the beginning of that file.

I am having trouble with Step 2 at the moment.  I can find plenty of documentation on merging files end to end, which I have done successfully, but not stitching them together. 

Do I do something like this...?

After the form has been completed, we'd like to offer a chance for the user to review their input before actually submitting the form (as well as going back to make changes to their data if requried).

Due to the large number of fields, I wanted to use a FormView control due to it's automatic databinding ability, removing a lot of tedious code, however there doesn't seem to be a simple way to offer this functionality.

At the moment, my current approach uses an ObjectDataSource to bind all the form fields. I've created two 'modes' of operation on the data source; one mode temporarily saves the object to the user Session (allowing retrieval again later for read-only/edit modes - this facilitates the review/modification functionality), while the second mode actually does the database insertion.

While this seems reasonably robust at this point, it still feels quite dirty to me. I know I could use a Wizard/Multiview type approach, but then you lose out on the niceties of automatic databinding (I believe?). I'm sure this is a fairly common problem, so how is this typically done in a Web Form environment?

Thanks!

All I want to achieve is to be able to manipulate the CSS using VB.NET code in the following ways:

 - Use an integer variable to store my ""golden"" number 7 and use that for width, padding, margin etc where needed
 - Use string variables to store my ""golden"" hex color codes e.g. ""#44C5F2"" and use them for color, background-color, border-color etc. where needed
 - Use an integer variable to set the height of an element and have four child elements each with height: mynum / 4

I just want to use basic VB.net number and string manipulation in order to create a CSS file on the fly.

I understand that the end product - the CSS file shouldn't change much - it should at most change on a daily basis otherwise caching couldn't be used.

I also understand that I would lose Visual Studio CSS intellisense support but...

How do I achieve this?

Should I be using:

 - Generic handlers (ASHX)
 - ASP.NET Themes
 - ASP.NET Skins
 - Something else?

We have an ASP.Net website, which generates a PDF report. To generate the PDF report we need to make multiple web-service calls (each call returns a part of the data). Most of the calls are to the same endpoint, but the methods and the parameters are different. To improve performance, we have thought of the following 2 approaches:

 1. Expose a web service operation that accepts parameters for all the individual calls. Internally, this method calls each of the methods one by one; when completed, it packs all the responses in a collection and sends it back. The ASP.Net web page then receives the list of responses and unpacks them and generates the report.
 2. Make parallel calls to the web service methods from the ASP.Net application. When all parallel calls are completed, collect all the responses and generate the PDF.

At first, the 2nd approach looks elegant; the problem is, how do we make the parallel web service calls. Thread.QueueUserWorkItem is not a good option as suggested here:

For example, a Web application might include the user's name as part of a welcome message or display a home address when confirming a shipping destination.

This is the process I was considering -

1.Develop on local Dev fabric

2. Maintain a common Build server which also hosts source control (we use TFS for both)

3. Use the build server for local testing which feeds bugs to development

5. Once any issues are fixed and the tests pass, deploy the same build to production account (directly from the build server, i could not think of a way to move from azure test to azure production)

Some points I ll have to take care of - 

1. Data will have to be reproduced from Production to Test servers for the testing to be effective

2. Build activities will have to be automated to reduce manual errors (especially changing account related parameters like keys)

I've got a button next to the fileupload control (besides the default browse... button to select the file) to actually take the file and upload it to a file server.

This works great if I use this button ""Upload"".  However, underneath my gridview I have another imagebutton that is outside of the gridview, its just sitting on the form / page.
The idea of this ""Update"" button is when end users make changes to the grid I can simply loop through the grid and update the values they have entered to the database.  This also works great.

**Now here is my issue** assume a user has 3 rows in the grid view.  On 2 of these rows he decides to add an attachment but he never clicks the ""Upload"" button he only uses the standard browse button to select the file.  Now instead of clicking the ""Upload"" button that is on the grid view he ends up clicking the ""Update"" button outside of the grid thinking that it will save his attachments.

So I decided to write code to grab the fileupload control from the grid using `.FindControls(""NameOfFileUploadControl"")` in my Update button loop where I loop through all the rows.  Then I check if `myFileUploadControl.HasFile` property to see if there exists a file and if there does upload the file then continue with the code.

The issue is when I click this ""Update"" button `.HasFile` always returns false even though I can see the text string of the path in the fileuploadcontrol textbox (the standard one next to the browse button).  Is it because this goes back to the page load event and checks if it is a post back?

- Custom domain objects
- ASP.Net (non MVC) UI containing grids from a 3rd party provider.

We have an ASP.NET website which references a couple of .NET DLLs and the performance was dramatic at our clients! On our own testserver the same set of data took 25 seconds (still not fast but that's another issue) and at our clients it took 6 minutes! 

I wrote logs in every possible routine that I could think of, logging how long it took. It showed that across all the routines across all the DLL's the processing of the code simply takes longer at our clients. 

To further test this I made a desktop application which references the exact same DLLs and ran this at the client. Those 6 minutes went down to... 5 seconds!!! What the... ?

How DetailsView can save edition values with use ICallbackEventHandler?
",asp.net,detailsview,icallbackeventhandler,,,,open,0,6716,8,"DetailsView loses datasource after callback with use ICallbackEventHandler I am trying make in my asp.net application modifications without Postback and without UpdatePanel. For paging and for modifying I want use only callbacks on the my site. For it I use an interface ""ICallbackEventHandler"".

This simple application has ""ASPGridView"" & ""ASPDetailsView"". Both with installed property EnableSortingAndPagingCallbacks=""True"".

But I have problem. I try save my DetailsView with use 
javascript:EditDetails('ASPDetailsView_SaveEdit|PRIMARY KEY')
But my DetailsView on server-side & client-htmlcode always **empty**! Why?

How I can transfer my edit of values from  DetailsView on server-side after user click the button ""Save""?

We have different versions of the global.asa that need to be substituted instead of different web configs. We are in the process of moving to a continuous integration environment so much of this still new to me. I've written a build script that performs the following tasks.

1. Cleans the buildartifacts directory if it exists.
2. Builds the solution file with whatever configuration is passed in. This produces output with each project in a separate folder.
3. Copies the files into the required folder structure.
4. Packages up the result using MSDeploy as sync.

My first problem is this ... 

When I run the MSBuild task like so ... 

    <MSBuild Projects=""$(SolutionFileName)"" 
             Properties=""Configuration=$(Configuration);OutDir=%(BuildArtifacts.FullPath)"" />

It builds the web app but does not apply any transformations. I would have assumed that MSBuild would apply the transforms automatically. Instead I end up with all 3 config files in the output folder that contains the build. Why is this? I've done some searching [here][1], and [here][2] and they are using a separate task to perform the transformation. IF Visual Studio can apply the transforms and Visual Studio uses MSBuild I would think that MSBuild could apply transfromations? Isn't MSBuild configuration aware?


My second problem is ... being a classic asp web app we can't really use config files for this part of it because ... well I'm not sure how the classic asp web app would access the config file? So we have different versions of the global.asa file that would normally get replaced manually. I suppose I could do some sort of search / copy the specific asa files that we require at that time, but is there a way to perhaps use transformations to do this task?

However, I think my problem may be somewhat different. I currently have a working shopping cart that I wrote back in the 1.1 days that uses ASP.NET session variables to keep track of everything. This has been in place for about 6 years and has served its purpose well. However, it has come time to upgrade the site and part of what I have been tasked with is creating a more, erm, user-friendly site. Part of this is removing `updatepanel`s and implementing real AJAX solutions.

My problem comes in where I need to persist this shopping cart over several pages. Sure I could use cookies, but I would like to keep track of carts for statistical purposes (abandonment stats, items added but not bought, those kinds of stats) as well as user-friendliness, like persisting their cart so that if they come back it is remembered. This is easy enough if a user is logged in, but I don't want to force a user to create an account if they don't want.

Additionally, the way we were processing orders was a bit, ehh, slapped-together. All of the details (color selected, type selected, etc) are passed to paypal via their description string which for the most part is ok, but if a product has selections that are too long for the string (255 chars i believe), they are cut off and we have to call the customer to confirm what they bought. If I were to implement a more ""solid"" shopping cart, we wouldn't have to do that because all the customer's choices would be stored, in addition to the order automatically being entered into the order processing system (they're manually entered into an excel spreadsheet. i know, right).

I want to do this the right way, but I don't want to use any sort of overblown software that won't really work with our current business model. Do I use a cookie to ""label"" each visitor to match them with their cart (give them a cookie with a GUID) across pages, keep their whole cart client side, keep the cart server side and just pull it from the db on each page refresh? Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Everyone preaches how you can do cleaner HTML. Guess, what? 1% of all people look at the outputted HTML. To me, I don't care if Webforms messes up my indentation in the rendered HTML, as long as I have code that is easy to maintain...This is not!

Disgusting!

Am I doing something wrong? Because I spent many dark days in classic ASP, and this tag soup reminds me strongly of it.

Everyone preaches how you can do cleaner HTML. Guess, what? 1% of all people look at the outputted HTML. To me, I don't care if Webforms messes up my indentation in the rendered HTML, as long as I have code that is easy to maintain...This is not!

So, convert me, a die hard webforms guy, why I should give up my nicely formed ASPX pages for this?

I have a web portal in .NET 3.5 on an IIS 6 web server.  Currently there is a page that is given a value and based on that value looks up a PDF file on a web service and displays the results to the user in another tab in the web page.  This is done with the following code.

     context.Response.ClearContent();
     context.Response.ClearHeaders();
     context.Response.Clear();
     context.Response.AddHeader(""Accept-Header"", pdfStream.Length.ToString());                                               
     context.Response.ContentType = ""application/pdf"";
     context.Response.BinaryWrite(pdfStream.ToArray());
     context.Response.Flush();

This works and has worked for years.  However we got an issue from the client that a particular client was having the PDF returned as the same PDF every time until they cleared temp internet cache.

I thought oh cool, this is an easy one.  I will just add the cache headers to the response to never cache it.  So I added the following:

 

    context.Response.Cache.SetCacheability(HttpCacheability.NoCache);//IE set to not cache
    context.Response.Cache.SetNoStore();//Firefox/Chrome not to cache
    context.Response.Cache.SetExpires(DateTime.UtcNow); //for safe measure expire it immediately 

After a quick test I got exactly what I was expecting in the response header.

    Cache-Control    no-cache, no-store 
    Pragma    no-cache 
    Expires    -1 


**The Problem:**

So this went live.  Everything seemed cool day one.  The day after, bam, everyone started getting white screens and no PDF displayed.  After further investigation, I found out it was only IE 6,7,8.  Chrome is fine, Firefox fine, safari fine, even IE 9 fine.  Without knowing the why this happened, I reverted my change and deployed it, and everything started worked again.

I have searched all over trying to find out why my caching headers seemed to confuse IE 6-8 to no avail.  Has anyone experienced this type of issue with IE 6-8?  Is there something I am missing?

After a quick test I got exactly what I was expecting in the response header.

    Cache-Control    no-cache, no-store 
    Pragma    no-cache 
    Expires    -1 


**The Problem:**

So this went live.  Everything seemed cool day one.  The day after, bam, everyone started getting white screens and no PDF displayed.  After further investigation, I found out it was only IE 6,7,8.  Chrome is fine, Firefox fine, safari fine, even IE 9 fine.  Without knowing the why this happened, I reverted my change and deployed it, and everything started worked again.

I have searched all over trying to find out why my caching headers seemed to confuse IE 6-8 to no avail.  Has anyone experienced this type of issue with IE 6-8?  Is there something I am missing?  Thanks for any insight.",5

I have tried using ""HttpContext.Current.User.Identity.Name"" but that does not get me the user that is trying to run the website it actually just gets the AD Account where the IIS Resides on.

2053817,01/13/2010 01:35:32,199813,10/30/2009 17:29:41,1,0,DropDownList in a DetailsView = HUGE problem!,"I really have a big problem(stuck)  with two dropdownlists inside a detailsview.
I have 4 detailsview : DdlRt,DdlRt2,ddlMobv1,ddlMobv2. Basically what happens here is that DdlRt2 gets populated when DdlRt is selected and ddlMobv2 gets populated when a specific value from ddlMobv1 is selected. 

In code posted above the detailsview has a ""Update"" command and the problem is when the update command is executed the data is successfully posted to the db BUT! THE VALUES from DdlRt2 and ddlMobv2 dissapear! And I can't insert any more Items. The only Item that stays in these two dropdownlists is the default ""Select Department"" item which is't set in codebehind but is set in .aspx.....I can't figure what I'm doing wrong here It must be something with databinding & events. 

So my question is ""Why can't I insert any more items to these two dropdownlists after the ""Update"" command on the DetailsView is set or how can I preserve the values that are already in""?

THANKS FOR YOUR HELP!

",asp.net,data-binding,,,,,open,0,2621,7,"DropDownList in a DetailsView = HUGE problem! I really have a big problem(stuck)  with two dropdownlists inside a detailsview.
I have 4 detailsview : DdlRt,DdlRt2,ddlMobv1,ddlMobv2. Basically what happens here is that DdlRt2 gets populated when DdlRt is selected and ddlMobv2 gets populated when a specific value from ddlMobv1 is selected. 

In code posted above the detailsview has a ""Update"" command and the problem is when the update command is executed the data is successfully posted to the db BUT! THE VALUES from DdlRt2 and ddlMobv2 dissapear! And I can't insert any more Items. The only Item that stays in these two dropdownlists is the default ""Select Department"" item which is't set in codebehind but is set in .aspx.....I can't figure what I'm doing wrong here It must be something with databinding & events. 

So my question is ""Why can't I insert any more items to these two dropdownlists after the ""Update"" command on the DetailsView is set or how can I preserve the values that are already in""?

THANKS FOR YOUR HELP!

Some times users lost authentication (I use the standard membership provider) during the navigation of the site and are redirected to the login page.
After some research I begin to suspect that the session is lost due to a restart of the application so I decided to install and configure the health monitoring service in order to track for Application shutdown and restart.

After some requests to the application I start to see the following entry in the health monitoring log:

    Event code: 1002 Event message: Application is shutting down. Reason: Hosting environment is shutting down. Event time: 12/8/2010 8:16:33 AM Event time (UTC): 12/8/2010 3:16:33 PM Event ID: d92fbba0487b4bab97bd7eff4b0083bb Event sequence: 38 Event occurrence: 1 Event detail code: 50002  Application information:     Application domain: /REMOVED FOR PRIVACY!

Process information:     Process ID: 12516     Process name: w3wp.exe     Account name: REMOVED FOR PRIVACY! 

and then a restart of the application.

Then I contacting the aspnix support and it says that the server is ok, that some other big site run with no issue on the same server and that it is probably a problem of my application.

So I start to investigate in my application but I cannot found any problem.

I also realize that the shutdown appears also when I request static resource like, for example a png image!

After some research I found this interesting post on the Scott Gu blog:
http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2005/12/14/433194.aspx

So I intercept the Application_End event in the global.asax as Scott teach and then I send a mail every time my application shutdown... and the content is every time the same:

    _shutDownMessage=HostingEnvironment initiated shutdown
    HostingEnvironment caused shutdown
    
    _shutDownStack=   at System.Environment.GetStackTrace(Exception e, Boolean needFileInfo)
      at System.Environment.get_StackTrace()
      at System.Web.Hosting.HostingEnvironment.InitiateShutdownInternal()
      at System.Web.Hosting.HostingEnvironment.InitiateShutdownWithoutDemand()
      at System.Web.Hosting.PipelineRuntime.StopProcessing()

I know that the the causes of a restart can be changes of the web.config, changes in the bin or aspx files, overuse of memory etc...
But in this case the application shutdown appear also with the request of a static resource and also the other part of the application are very simple and use only the standard membership provider and some linq to sql query...

I also have subscribed to the Application_Error event for all the unhandled exception with no results.

Any idea?

The purpose is to allow a website owner to update their web page content on a few pages. I have the system completed except for knowing what to do with the resultant HTML markup.

After the page editor completes their work, I can get the output from FreeTextBox, in html format, like so: `<font color=""#000080""><b>This is some text.</b></font>`

I tried storing it as escaped markup in web.config, but that didn't work since it kept hosing the tags even after I changed them to escaped characters, like so: `&lt;font color=&quot;#000080&quot;&gt;`

The reason I wanted to store this kind of string as a key in web.config is that I could successfully store a static string, set a lebel's value to it, and successfully render the text. But when I try to escape it, it gets reformatted in web.config by .Net somehow.

So I escaped all the characters, encoded them as Base64 and stored that. Then on page_load, I tried to decode it, but it just shows up as text, with all the html tags showing as well - it doesn't get rendered.

Basically, any time data needs to be stored, a session is used.

This is pretty much the exact opposite of what I do. If it looks like a session variable is needed, I'll rethink my design, or maybe sacrifice some efficiency (i.e. reload the data from the databse, rather than store it in a session). 

I'm actually thinking that we should always wrap our session objects as Singletons or something to ensure they're not overly used.

My argument is that Session items are really global variables, so if you find yourself using it to pass data around whenever you feel like it, you're making the page tightly coupled with other pages, bcause they rely on some other page setting the value. 

Also, you can never rely on the data coming through being correct, as another page may have changed it in the intrim, ie: Session[""Id""] on one page might accidentally get overidden by a Session[""Id""] in another browser tab.

There are actually lots of other reasons I think of as well, but can anyone confirm this for me?

Thus, the url would be something like www.mysite.com/City-State/My-Search-Term/ which redirects to Results.aspx that reads the rewritten querystring.

I'm considering hosting it on a normal shared hosting like GoDaddy or on Windows Azure Web Sites.

I like the idea of scaling the hosting parameters on Azure in case the website starts to succeed. But on the other hand their terms aren't clear to me.

Will I possibly be able to let the users upload files there?

Another important thing is that I heard that shared hosting can ban you website if it has too many viewers. This actually happened to my friend, who had about 40 000 uu/day. (I don't know if it's the same GoDaddy - he was using some other hosting) I really wouldn't like this to happen.

I'd like to choose the better option if the costs are similar, but I don't want to put too much money there until I know it succeeds.

This is for testing purposes.  It's not UI testing; I'm really just testing the use of a library in an ASPNET context. 

Normally this kind of thing is done with a call to `System.Web.Hosting.ApplicationHost.CreateApplicationHost` . 

This is how I have it currently:

            }

            var a = System.Reflection.Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly();
            string destfile= Path.Combine(""bin"", Path.GetFileName(a.Location));
            File.Copy(a.Location, destfile, true);

                  System.IO.Directory.GetCurrentDirectory() // physical dir
                  );

            aspNetHostIsUnloaded = new ManualResetEvent(false);

            host.NotifyUnload = this.HostedDomainHasBeenUnloaded;

            foreach (string page in pages)
                host.ProcessRequest(page);

        }
        finally
        {
            // tell the host to unload
            if (host!= null)
            {
                AppDomain.Unload(host.GetAppDomain());

                // wait for it to unload
                aspNetHostIsUnloaded.WaitOne();

This works ok.  But I'd like to avoid the creation of the bin directory, and the copying of the assembly into it, if possibble.  

Is it possible to use `CreateApplicationHost`, and tell ASPNET to load assemblies from the current directory, or an arbitrary directory, rather than `bin`?

This is for testing purposes.  It's not UI testing; I'm really just testing the use of a library in an ASPNET context. 

Normally this kind of thing is done with a call to `System.Web.Hosting.ApplicationHost.CreateApplicationHost` . 

This is how I have it currently: 


    public void Run(string[] pages)
    {
        bool cleanBin = false;
        MyAspNetHost host = null;

        try
        {
            if (!Directory.Exists(""bin""))
            {
                cleanBin = true;
                Directory.CreateDirectory(""bin"");
            }

            var a = System.Reflection.Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly();
            string destfile= Path.Combine(""bin"", Path.GetFileName(a.Location));
            File.Copy(a.Location, destfile, true);

            host = 
                (MyAspNetHost) System.Web.Hosting.ApplicationHost.CreateApplicationHost
                ( typeof(MyAspNetHost), 
                  ""/foo"",   // virtual dir
                  System.IO.Directory.GetCurrentDirectory() // physical dir
                  );

            aspNetHostIsUnloaded = new ManualResetEvent(false);

            host.NotifyUnload = this.HostedDomainHasBeenUnloaded;

            foreach (string page in pages)
                host.ProcessRequest(page);

        }
        finally
        {
            // tell the host to unload
            if (host!= null)
            {
                AppDomain.Unload(host.GetAppDomain());

                // wait for it to unload
                aspNetHostIsUnloaded.WaitOne();

                // remove the bin directory
                if (cleanBin)
                {
                    Directory.Delete(""bin"", true);
                }
            }
        }
    }


This is the custom ASP.NET host:

    public class MyAspNetHost : System.MarshalByRefObject 
    {
        public MyAspNetHost()
        {
            // the hosted assembly registers for its own domain unload event
            GetAppDomain().DomainUnload += DomainUnload;
        }
    
        public void ProcessRequest(string page)
        {
            var request = new System.Web.Hosting.SimpleWorkerRequest(page,               // page being requested
                                                                     null,               // query
                                                                     System.Console.Out  // output
                                                                     );
            System.Web.HttpRuntime.ProcessRequest(request);
        }

    
        public AppDomain GetAppDomain()
        {
            return System.Threading.Thread.GetDomain();
        }

    
        private void DomainUnload(object source, System.EventArgs e)
        {
            if (NotifyUnload!=null)
            {
                NotifyUnload(this, EventArgs.Empty);
            }
        }
    
        public /* event */  System.EventHandler NotifyUnload;

I've used and followed Scott Mitchell's tutorial (http://www.4guysfromrolla.com/articles/093009-1.aspx) and K. Scott Allen's ChartBuilder class (http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/mag200903XASP/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=2245) and all works well. 

However when have two series that I want to show on the same Chart, if one set of data does not have all of the X values the other series does, the chart blindly puts all the data on, ignoring trying to match the X values of the other series, therefore mismatching the X values when the chart is shown.

I know that I can fiddle the data so that both sets of data have the same X values, however I'm trying to make the class handle anomalies in the data so that I don't have to worry too much about the data.

Any help is greatly appreciated.

This works great.

Now, on asp.net, I am using multiview and I am trying to accomplish the same.

On view1, I have the checkboxes. When I click next, I will like to display the correct dropdownlist based on the value of checked box.

How can I accomplish something similar as the code above?

Thanking you in advance.",2

I have a requirement where i will have to show top 5 news in my home page. SO what i have thot is:  

 - After the page is loaded, I will call a web service which will send me
   html version of my top 5 news. (Ajax
   way)
 - Using javascript I will insert the returned formatted html string inside
   a div tag.

Ok,
But I was looking for some good way of generating the formatted html. My actual data is inside a DataTable. I was wondering wether this can be done by xslt & xml or not.  

I had earlier used StringBuilder way to make the dynamic html after inemurating the DataTable, but I dont feel that its not the preferred way because if later i have to add some extra formatting then i have to again modify my code & publish the dll.  

Just wanted to know what techniques should be used for such kind of scenarios. Need your valuable suggestions and if possible sample links.

Sample DataTable:  

    Id- Heading - Description  - link  
    1 - hello   - how are you  - yahoo.com  
    2 - bye     - I am leaving - google.com

A much better approach (in my opinion) is like in Winforms or resource files - you have your `.whatever` file, and then there is `.whatever.desginer.cs` file. This designer file is created at runtime as you type. When you compile, the compiler doesn't care about your `.whatever` file, it just takes the `.whatever.designer.cs` file and produces a single solid assembly.

This provides several benefits:

* You can inherit your forms from each other, similar to windows forms;
* You can always see the code that is being generated, possibly adjusting your markup to generate better code;
* You can easily instantiate strongly typed instances of your forms;

The only benefit I can see from dynamic compilation is that

* You can change the markup file anytime and don't need to recompile the app.

To be honest, I've often wanted for one of the first three benefits, but never for the last one. Recompiling the app to see your changes isn't that big of a deal. Especially since you have to do it anyway when working with code-behind, where the most of your time will be. And when you deliver your app to the client, you deliver it as a monolithic, precompiled block. When you update, you update everything, not just individual `.aspx` files - there's no point to.

I was able to fill/populate the table but was not able to access the row/col or the controls inside the table when I click OK on the Popup.

When the page loads I get this error:

If I move the CustomObjectDataSources srcBrokers and srcAccounts ""inside"" the EditItemTemplate, the page loads fine, HOWEVER, when I select a broker in ddlBrokers, I get the same error again:

    Databinding methods such as Eval(), XPath(), and Bind() can only be used in the context of a databound control.

Any ideas on how to fix this? Should the data sources be outside of the EditItemTemplate or inside?

My idea is to have a method which will return to me a string with the value of the URL to the streaming page.

 I've tried many different ways to do this, but no one of them worked; I tried using DownloadString, even writting the raw URL, but i always had errors so i found one way to just make it happen:

    [WebMethod]
    public string WatchMedia(string title)
    {
        Global.Media = title;

        Streaming str = new Streaming(); //Streaming.aspx

        return str.GetURL();
    }

 Okay so, in my aspx.cs i included this:

        internal string GetURL()
        {
           return HttpContext.Current.Request.Url.AbsoluteUri.ToString();
        }

 Don't really ask me about the 'internal', i'm so tired of trying different ways to get this to work that i just go along with that VS builds for me.

 That does give me the URL i thought i wanted, BUT, it doesn't work, why? Because it says, give or take (directly translated):

        The request format is not recognized for the unexpectedly terminated URL in /WatchMedia

 WatchMedia is the name of my method as seen above.

 Now, beside's hoping someone can give me a straight answer as to what ridiculous sin am i hurting my self with here, i'd like to know if this is the way for a streaming webservice to work? I can't seem to find any real information about video streaming webservices over the www, not even Google will tell me!",asp.net,web-services,url,request,webmethod,,open,0,314,7,"ASPX URL is broken & Streaming WebService I'm attempting to create a streaming webservice, unfortunally i even lack its concept overall.

That is, in the Application_Start event I launch a new ""email"" thread whose purpose is to sleep until the configured time, upon ""waking"" produce a report and email it to my administrative user(s) and go back to sleep until the configured duration elapses at which time, the report is created again and emailed out. I am currently configured to start at 1900 and produce a new report every 12 hours.  

As time marches on with this production site, however, something is causing an ""extra"" thread to be created. This, in turn, results in a duplicate report being emailed. While the problem is benign enough, I'd like to clean this up if possible. Here's a snippet:

Examining the Application Event Log on the webserver, I can see the above message properly upon an IISRESET. This is followed by another ""proper"" logged event in the **workerThread** which tells us how long the code will sleep before the next report time. Here is a snippet from the workerThread:

In the IIS application pool assigned to this website, I have the following settings:

    - Recycle worker processes (in minutes) is UNCHECKED
    - Recycle worker process (number of requests) is UNCHECKED
    - Recycle worker process (at various times) is UNCHECKED / nothing specified
    - [Idle timeout] Shutdown worker process after being idle for (time in minutes) is UNCHECKED
 
I have noticed that the Application_Start event can be entered again (in one case roughly 38 minutes after the first time) which causes my code to run again and create another [and unwanted] thread. 

I would appreciate suggestions on how to tighten this up to make this symptom go away.

Enterprise application - very will written for its time in 2004. 

Stack:
.NET, Heavy use of Remoting, ASMX style web services, SQL Server

Problem:
The application allows user to go through various wizards for lack of a better term, all of their actions are stored in what we call ""wizard state"", which is essentially XML that is persisted to a SQL server database very frequently because we allow users to pause/resume their application. Often in these wizards, the XML that comprises the wizard state grows very large, I'm talking 5-8 MB of data, and we noticed that when we had a sudden influx of simultaneous users, we started receiving occasional timeouts against the database, because a lot of what the wizard state is comprised of, is keeping track of collections of ""things"". Sometimes these custom collections grow very large.

Question:
We were in a meeting today and we're expecting a flurry of activity in October that will test the system like never before, and possibly result in huge wizard states that go back and forth from the web server to the database. The crux of the situation is that there is only one database and one web server. 

For arguments sake, because of the complexity of the application, lets say adding any kind of clustering/mirroring to increase database throughput is out of the question. I spoke up in the meeting and said the quickest way to address this in the shortest time period would be to add more servers to the front end web application so the load could be distributed amongst web servers. The development lead said I was completely wrong and it would have no effect because we only have one database, so adding more web power would do nothing. He is having one of the other developers reduce the xml bloat that we persist frequently to the database. Probably in the long run, reducing the size of the xml that we pass back and forth is the right idea, but will adding additional web servers truly have no effect, I just think in terms of simultaneous users, it *should* help. 

Any responses thoughts are appreciated, proof that more web servers would help would be pure win.

Thanks.

Enterprise application - very will written for its time in 2004. 

Stack:
.NET, Heavy use of Remoting, ASMX style web services, SQL Server

Problem:
The application allows user to go through various wizards for lack of a better term, all of their actions are stored in what we call ""wizard state"", which is essentially XML that is persisted to a SQL server database very frequently because we allow users to pause/resume their application. Often in these wizards, the XML that comprises the wizard state grows very large, I'm talking 5-8 MB of data, and we noticed that when we had a sudden influx of simultaneous users, we started receiving occasional timeouts against the database, because a lot of what the wizard state is comprised of, is keeping track of collections of ""things"". Sometimes these custom collections grow very large.

Question:
We were in a meeting today and we're expecting a flurry of activity in October that will test the system like never before, and possibly result in huge wizard states that go back and forth from the web server to the database. The crux of the situation is that there is only one database and one web server.

Basically, I have one user control which has a GridView in it. And this GridView is dynamically generated based on a public property on the control (named Parameter in the simplified code below).

Everything is fine when I insert this control in an aspx page, set its Parameter property and call DataBind(Parameter) on it. GridView is generated and populated on the UI.

Problem occurs when I post-back the page. I have to regenerate the GridView structure so that the data in the ViewState of the control can be used to populate the GridView. So that I can achieve its content. But as long as the GridView structure is generated dynamically and it is based on the Parameter property set on it, this is not possible. Because the OnInit of the user control is called before the OnInit of the page and that is why the Parameter property is set after the generation of the GridView structure. As a result I get an empty Gridview in the end.

Here is the code in a simplified way.

Can you give me some recommendation how to overcome this?

2) If I had configured Integrated windows authentication in iis and used a)Windows b) Passport c)Forms d)None authentication in asp.net what difference it will bring

3) How to use passport authentication. Even I set passport authentication in iis and asp.net it doesn't given me any configuration screen to configured user for passport authentication.

4) If I am using basic or digest authentication in iis what change it also bring when I use different authentication in asp.net

            <asp:PlaceHolder ID=""col2Holder"" runat=""server""></asp:PlaceHolder> 
      </EditItemTemplate>  


but to no avail.
Any tips on  how I can create the Placeholder only in some cases (like for some values of Column1/Column2), rather than opt for a repeater approach...
I get a null reference exception but that was solved when I had to explicitly mention:

    protected PlaceHolder col2Holder = new Placeholder();

instead of 

    protected PlaceHolder col2Holder; 

But though method1 is able to set the 'Column1's text value correctly, it does nothing for the Column2's value...
Is there something I'm missing or is there a different way to do this?

Here's method1's defn:

    public string Method1(string col1, string col2)
    {
        col1 += ""Called method1""; 
         Label col2label= new Label();
 
         col2label.Visible = true;
         col2label.Text = col2;         
                 
         col2Holder.Controls.Add(col2label);
         col2Holder.DataBind();
                 
    return col1;
   }

**So here are my questions regarding this:**

 1. Why is Request.QueryString readonly?
 2. Why does this code/hack work*?
 3. How safe is it, if you change to readonly as soon as you are done editing, both regarding bad errors or unexpected behaviour, and regarding maintaining and understanding the code? 
 4. Where in the event cycle would it make most sense to do this crazy edit if you are only using PageLoad and OnPageRender?

***More details:**

I have a page with items that are grouped into tabs. Each tab is an asp:LinkButton

I want to be able to link directly to a specific tab. I do that with a QueryString parameter 'tab=tabName'. It works. But when I then click a new tab, the querystring is still in the Url, and thus the tab specified in the Querystring gets activated and not the one I clicked.

This is not an advertizing procedure (spam) rather inform them for their status from time to time. The number of emails that have to be sent in batch are up to 5000.

Then the user is given a chance to update/edit the request using several buttons on the Details.aspx page, but every button will need to return the user to the inbox with the preference of filter that the user had before vising the Details.aspx page.

In other words, I would like to do the following once the user presses a button on the Details.aspx page

        Sub btnUpdateRequest() Handles btnUpdateRequest.Click

        'My code here for the button action (update/edit/send/cancel)
        ' once the job is done, return the user to the Inbox.aspx page with the same filter

        Response.Redirect(""javascript:History.Back()"")
        End Sub

But I know that Response.Redirect does not accept javascript, and I don't want to split the code between Code Behind file, and ASPX file (adding OnClientClick attribute) because I will need to perform both VB instructions and also redirecting the user.

OS: Windows 7 64 bit (laptop)
Dev: Visual Studio 2010
Source Control: VSS 6.0
User Account: Domain level admin

The app is configured in ISS and in VS I open the site with ""Open Web Site"" option, Local IIS. As soon as I hit F5, I immediately get the error. It won't even hesitate, nothing.

This is an app that I've managed for a long time. At the office I use my desktop with same configuration and all. At the end of the day I check in my work, and on days when I use the laptop, I get my latest from VSS and no issues. Until today.

If I open the project by clicking on my project name in ""Recent Projects"", it runs using its virtual IIS but that causes issues because I have ""global"" folders in the root of wwwroot that my apps access.

I've tried various suggestions from different post but without luck.

**Partial Views**

 - when to use them

 - why to use them

 - how to organize them

The answer to the first two questions is relatively obvious, but I list them to see if there might be some non-obvious answers to them.  The last question deals with what I am struggling right now as I design out my framework.  Some people say to name them with an ""_"", but I don't like that so much because some of these partial views are requested from ajax and not simply included into another view.  In order to not have to specify the view name in the controller everytime, I have to name the action with an ""_"" and that doesn't seem right.

I am also interested in how to organize them in the directory hierarchy.  Do you place all your partial views in the Shared folder just because two different controllers may use them?  Even if they would logically be grouped with views of a specific controller?  What if there is an action for the partial view?

**AJAX**

 - single page application design?

 - how to manage/organize javascript

 - If javascript files are included in html loaded via ajax or otherwise loaded via a javascript call, how do you debug it?  Firebug seems to have stripped out all of the formatting.

5. Some kind of easy to use AJAX support would be great but not nessecary. 

If you just know one of these Frameworks i would still be very happy if you let me know how it fits in my requierments (upvote included).

So far it seems a normal error, but when I checked my DB behind the request I found that this field is filled in and that the link is correct. SQL manager screens to show this information:

Profiles table:

![profiles DB][3]

Persons table:

As one can see all the PersonIDs are set so normally all the links should be loaded? Sometimes this is the case, but sometimes however this nullreference pops up from out of nowhere. Am I forgetting something? Should I manually load something?

Do you think storing all static data into a hashtable is this a good idea for performance, 
or would it be better for each class to have its own static data holders inside their class?

**Is this thread safe**? Note: I am implementing Hashtable.Synchronized and Interlocked.CompareExchange to prevent race conditions - **but what about locking and contention**?

Note, the data is never changed once it has been set the first time round (the items in the hashtable never need updating).

Any thoughts or pointers?

thanks.",asp.net,vb.net,caching,static,thread-safety,,open,0,977,5,"asp.net static caching in hashtable I was previously using the application object to cache data that never changes. I am rewriting the project and have found out the aplication object is a no-no and is just there for legacy support from clasic ASP.

I know I can also use the cache - but I don't want to as I use that for data that needs to be invalidated.

I am therefore looking at static variables for static data (makes sense).

My question is, rather than specifying static variables in each class, I was thinking of using a hashtable to store all the data and wrapping it into its own class - like a factory.

Hello,

I have a LinkButton in an aspx page that will execute vb.net code-behind.

That is, after waiting 30-40 seconds, it finially begins the code-behind. (This is bad).

    Protected Sub SendToBatch_Click(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs) Handles SendToBatch.Click
    
    'Some WCF calls and other junk

    End Sub

Now if I put a breakpoint on the line of code that reads 'Protected Sub', hit F5, and then click my button, the application will spin for 30-40 seconds before finally jumping to the ClickEvent. It's not firing javascript or anything else, and I've set validation to false on the linkbutton. It still spins for a minute (sometimes timing out) before finally starting the code-behind.

For whatever reason, there's no problem with Chrome -- just IE. Unfortunately, this is an intranet application and the whole company is on IE8 as a standard.

Here's the aspx code, the LinkButton in question is 'SendToBatch', near the bottom.

My problem starts when I am in edit mode and I need to update the grid with new data. Since only the textbox control is databound, the RowUpdating event can only access data from the textbox column and all of my other data simply gets discarded. I also can't databind with checkbox and dropdownlist control, since they can get an invalid data type exception. So, does anyone know how can I update a column that has three different controls, where each of these three controls might have a valid data?

Thanks",asp.net,gridview,gridviewcolumn,,,,open,0,265,8,"Multiple databound controls in a single GridView column I have a grid view that is data bound to a dataset.

Everything is simple enough when we need just to display data - in gridview_prerender event I simply make one of the controls visible. The control is setup like following:

We use WIF on the server, the users of the application get the FedAuth cookie when they authenticate themselves with a WCF request. Afterwards we use the same cookie for every subsequent request to keep the user authenticated on the phone.

These cookies are HttpOnly, so they are not accessible directly, but that is not a problem, since we can share a `CookieContainer` object with every WCF service client.

However, we need to use a `BackgroundTransferRequest` to download a file from the server, where we also need to authenticate the user with the FedAuth cookie. But we can not access the cookie directly from the `CoookieContainer`, and `BackgroundTransferRequest` does not seem to support using a `CookieContainer`, only adding the cookies directly to its headers.

So my question is, how can I use `BackgroundTransferRequest`, if I have to send to the server the HttpOnly FedAuth cookie given by WIF? I would NOT want to switch off HttpOnly, if there is any other solution.

(I have seen that [this][1] specific question did not get any answers, which *might* mean  it is not possible to directly associate a `CookieContainer` with a `BackgroundTransferRequest`.)

Our hosting service (ITech) has a server farm so it is imperative that we get this working against SqlServer for the session management.

The issue that we are seeing is on the save of objects that were placed into session and then later retrieved. The rowstate for the objects are getting reset to invalid instead of added etc.
We contacted Entity Spaces for assistance and their advice was to use “their” serialization method to convert the objects into a string and then placing the string into the session. When we attempted this, the primary object was being serialized properly but it did not attempt to serialize any child objects in the object graph. For instance, a loan object with a list of borrowers hanging off of it. The loan itself would be serialized but not the borrowers list.

If I serialized manually to binary and store that into the session, the entire object graph is there but now we are back to the rowstate not being set properly. I decided to work around this by creating my own rowstate property called “Status”. I then would set the Status property to the objects rowstate just before I serialized to binary. Then I would flip the rowstate from invalid to whatever Status was set to when I deserialized the object. This all “looked” right in the debugger but, when I told it to save, Entity Spaces did not create the right SQL.  It tried to save without the values of the properties of the entity.

Has anyone else attempted this and if so, did you find a solution?

If there is a checkbox that is not available, but should be, I have added a textbox so that user can add a new feature to the product.

Once I added the textbox, it stopped allowing inserts. At first it was in the same If Else as the checkbox for each loop, but I have recently changed it so the textbox is in it's own for each loop. I have an underline under the words txtFeature.Text that says `Value of type 'Char' cannot be converted to 'System.Web.UI.WebControl.Textbox.'`

I run a high-traffic ASP.NET site on a 64-bit machine.  I have IIS running in 32-bit mode, however, due to some legacy components of the app.  I am running this particular web app inside an application pool that has the web garden option on (running 6 processes inside an 8 core machine).

Once or twice a week one of the processes will skyrocket into 100% CPU utilization, causing a giant slowdown for the site, so my plan was to wait until that happens, memory dump the offending process, then poke around WinDbg to zero in on the thread that's spiking to see where the code is spinning its wheels.

I've debugged using WinDbg before to figure out what was causing a deadlock on the site, but that was several months ago and I can't remember how I got it working.  (As a side note, this is a lesson to document everything you do.)

I'm running WinDbg on the Windows 2003 server that's running the site, so as to prevent any DLL version problems.  Here have been my steps so far, please let me know where I'm going wrong to get the error message that I'm getting.

1. I first memory dump the spiking process using UserDump, with the following command, where 3389 is the ID of the process:

    `userdump -k 3389`

2. I load the dump into the x86 edition of WinDbg.

3. Since I'm running 32-bit on a 64-bit machine, I first load the memory dump and then:

    `.load wow64exts`
    
    `.effmach x86`

4. I make sure that my symbol path includes the directory that contains my apps PDB files:

    `.sympath+ c:\inetpub\myapp\bin`
 
5. Running just `.load SOS' fails with an error of ""The system cannot find the file specified"", so I go the fully qualified route of the following, which works:

    `.load c:\windows\microsoft.net\framework\v2.0.50727\sos`

From here, I'm lost.  I try any of the SOS commands, like `!threads`, only to get this error:

    Failed to load data access DLL, 0x80004005

That error is also accompanied by the numbered list of items that I should be verifying.  I have verified that I am running the most current version of the debugger, mscordacwks.dll is in fact in the same directory as the mscorwks.dll file, and I'm debugging on the same architecture as the dump file.  

I've also run the magical ""`.cordll -ve -u -l`"" command, but that doesn't solve anything.  I'm always greeted with ""`CLR DLL status: No load attempts`"" when I execute that.  Then I try ""`.reload`"", which yields a handful of warnings like ""`WARNING: wldap32 overlaps dnsapi`"".  I *wish* it said something like ""`CLRDLL: Loaded DLL C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727\mscordacwks.dll`"".  But it doesn't.

I understand that I want to keep the entity context out of the web project and only use the business objects the framework creates but I can't figure out how to save a modified object this way.

Let's say my entity model created this class:

	public class Person //Person entity
	{
		Int32 Id {get;set;}
		String Name {get;set;}
		Address Address {get;set;} //Address entity
	}

		public static Person GetById(int id)
		{
			using (Entities context = new Entities())
			{
				return context.Persons.FirstOrDefault(x => x.Id == id);
			}
		}

This allows me to get a person without a context by calling PersonController.GetById(1); and I can change the persons properties after I get them but I can't figure out how to save the modified information back to the database. Ideally I would like to partial class Person and add a .Save() method which would handle creating a context adding the person to it and saving the changes. But when I tried this a while ago there were all kinds of issues with it still being attached to the old context and even if I detatch it and attatch it to a new context it gets attached as EntityState.Unchanged, if I remember right, so when I call context.SaveChages() after attaching it nothing actually gets updated.

I guess I have two questions:

1) Am I going about this in a good way/is there a better way? If I'm doing this in a really terrible way I would appreciate some psudo-code to point me in the right direction; a link to a post explaining how to go about this type of thing would work just as well.

On one page (results.aspx) I create a cookie, adding entries every time the user clicks a checkbox. When the user clicks a button, they're taken to another page (graph.aspx) where the contents of that cookie is read. 

The problem is that the cookie doesn't seem to exist on graph.aspx. The following code returns null:

    Request.Cookies[""MyCookie""];

The weird thing is this is only an issue on our staging server. This app is deployed to a production server and it's fine. It also works perfectly locally.

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1973933/opinions-on-msdeploy

http://www.beansoftware.com/ASP.NET-Tutorials/Restart-Stop-Application.aspx

Meanwhile, we will continue attempting to isolate the instances when it is generated.

Thank you",4

If an user request wants to use that information, and it is nor ready, the thread will be block with a Monitor.Wait. When the information is ready, the cache object will Monitor.Pulse all waiting threads. This should be fine, since the information takes a dozen of seconds, and the user has to be redirected to the login page, post login information, and be redirected again.

The problem, is that Monitor.Wait will block the CLR ThreadPool thread, and as far as I know if a burst of requests arrives asking for the ""big information"", the application could remain block by CLR ThreadPool starvation (I have a little mess with the current IIS/ASP.NET thread gating).

Since the big piece of information comes from a web service that I call asynchronously, I have the IAsyncResult of that operation. 

So, Is there a way to tell a CLR ThreadPool Thread ""Wait for this IOCP"", so the threadpool thread can start to attend other call?

I have the feeling that this is not well explained, let me know if it is not clear what I am asking.

This lets me just return the objects, and never have to worry about their serialized values - they're always secure.

Unfortunately, it appears that if I use `query.FutureValue<class>()`, the object that gets serialized is first the `NHibernate.Impl.FutureValue<class>` and not my entity, which means I get JSON that looks like this if I throw it in a dictionary and return it to the client:

    {key: { Value: { /* my serialized object properties */ } }

Previously I discovered that I can't get any interfaces to work in ASP's JavaScriptConverter implementations... only regular or abstract classes.  So returning `typeof(IFutureValue<MyBaseClass>)` as a supported type means my converter is completely ignored.  I can catch MyBaseClass, because I refactored things earlier to use an abstract base instead of an interface, but not the interface.

And then I discover that the FutureValue implementation in .Impl is internal to the assembly, or some other such nonsense that only serves to make my .NET experience even more painful.  So I can't use `typeof(FutureValue<MyBaseClass>)` to handle it all, because FutureValue exists only in my debugging sessions.

Is there a way to get the class type out of the assembly?  Or a way to convince ASP that interfaces do in fact have uses?  Or might there be some superclass I *can* access that would let me get around the whole issue?

        <forms name=""Authlogin"" loginUrl=""logon.aspx"" protection=""All"" timeout=""60"" path=""."" />

      </authentication>

So if users is unauthorized then he would be redirected to logon.aspx.
This solution works well on visual studio testing server and user get redirected to logon.aspx,but it doesn't work at all on my shared hosting ( godaddy ).It seems like rules just ignored.
Any ideas how to make it work...or why it doesn't work on hosting?",3

I've read a lot of articles and I'm thinking on disabling completely the SessionState, I think this would make a more robust application, and will save me a couple of headaches (Everything I've read tells me that handling sessions on a farm isn't trivial).

There are some things that I still don't have totally clear with this approach though, the main one being the authentication/authorization process. Basically I'm not sure of how (if?) I can handle user sessions if there's no SessionState enabled on the server.
If a user logs into the web site and then tries to access another page, how can I know that the user is already logged in?
I know using cookies is insecure, I thought of a mix of cookies with the session Id stored in the DB, but I suppose that if I disable SessionState I won't have access to the session id either.


What's the best approach on this? Is there any recommended book/article you can point me to so I can get this clear?

After searching through SO and Googling a bit, I've come to an understanding that Web Forms, MVC or a Content Management System are the available options. But what I am not able to foresee/calculate is that which method would be the best way to go with?

I mean applying usual programming skills, which platform would be of help to someone achieve a high-performace, greatly usable e-commerce website?

Any help and guidance would be sincerely appreciated.

Thanks a lot!",4

The login request should create some cookies in the client that are used in the next request (IsAuthenticated) and in the last one (the real request actually).
However IsAuthenticated return false just after i did the login correctly (i can see it return true as expected). It is like if i never logged in.  
So the question is: how can i save cookies in proxy?  
I am open to answers that take in consideration also `HttpHandlers` or other thechiques to do ajax proxying, not necessarily Aspx.  
Note: if i make the same request series i can see cookies get created so it must be a matter about my aspx proxy",3

I have been asked to create a ASP.NET version of an existing PHP website, this website has a huge number of existing links to it in a particular format, which I have to replicate in due to the amount of work to change all the existing links would be far too much.

The format of the existing links is;

    /([A-Za-z0-9]{14})/([A-Za-z0-9_-]*)


My attempt at creating a custom route doesn't appear to be working. What I have done is change the RegisterRoutes method in Global.asax.cs file to be;

    public static void RegisterRoutes(RouteCollection routes)
    {
        routes.IgnoreRoute(""{resource}.axd/{*pathInfo}"");
    
        routes.MapRoute(
            ""ExistingLink"",
            ""{LinkId}/{Title}"",
            new {controller=""ExistingLinkController"", action=""Index""},
            new {LinkId = @""([A-Za-z0-9]{14})"", Title = @""([A-Za-z0-9_-]*)""});
    
        routes.MapRoute(
            ""Default"", // Route name
            ""{controller}/{action}/{id}"", // URL with parameters
            new { controller = ""Home"", action = ""Index"", id = UrlParameter.Optional } // Parameter defaults
        );
    
    }


I have also created the 'ExistingLinkController' with an 'Index' action of;

    public ActionResult Index(string LinkId, string Title)
    {
        ViewData[""LinkId""] = LinkId;
        ViewData[""Title""] = Title;
        return View();
    }

And a view which contains the code;

    <h2>LinkId: <%: ViewData[""LinkId""] %>
    </h2>Title: <%: ViewData[""Title""] %></h2>


But when I try to go to;

> /55a3ef90c4b709/This-is-just-a-test_0-9

I get the following error;

> Description: HTTP 404. The resource

I was wondering whether anyone can see what I am doing wrong and possibly point me in the right direction, perhaps pointing at the bit of code that's wrong if its a simple problem or pointing me to a article that will help me get a better understanding if I've got the wrong end of the stick with this routing stuff.

I'm having some search results page (of some items). The user is able to perform some actions on each item, such as rating, leave a comment, mark as spam, etc. All these actions are performed on a modal popup from the ajaxcontrol toolkit. hence each item is pretty heavy on controls.

I get the expected editor for SomeFoo, and any elements of SomeFooList which are not null, as the type in ModelMetaData will be ""Foo"". However, if I have ""null"" as one of the objects in SomeFooList, I get nothing rendered as model is of type ""object"" and not Foo or more generically T from my list's generic arguments.

Essentially I would like to achieve something like

    <%@ Control Language=""C#"" Inherits=""System.Web.Mvc.ViewUserControl<IEnumerable<T>> where T : class"" %>

so I know the types of my list.

I could also look at changing the ModelMetaData.ModelType field in the case of a null (by creating a new object, as this is readonly) -- but this is one of those nasty hacks I would like to avoid.

Another thought is calling the EditorFor method with .Invoke and passing typeof(T) into there, but again, I would like to avoid this type of code if possible.

Any thoughts?

 1. RSSProducer.aspx: A page that generates RSS (XML) feeds
 2. RssConsumer.aspx: A page that retrieves the RSS feeds and displays it to the user


My problem is that user-authorization details are stored in session in the RssConsumer page that need to be accessed in the RSSProducer page; however, the Session identifier is not common between the two. This means that I cannot access the authorization details in the RSSProducer page.

The reason for why is fairly clear to me:

    

 1. User's browser makes a request to
    the RssConsumer page
 2. Server generates a Session ID (which is stored in a cookie) if
    there is no existing Session
    Identifer
 3. The RSSConsumer requests the RSSProducer page...which generates a
    new Session ID every time because no
    session identifier is ever going to
    be found.

I tried using cookieless session so that I could pass the SessionID via the URL to the RSSProducer page as an experiment but for some reason the XmlTextReader doesn't work well with this method (but the desired shared session does work).

I've hit a brick wall here.
Does anyone know how to share session between pages when one page makes a request to the other?

Thanks,

I've noticed 2 things with the button. The button returns an error occurred and even though the label changes the viewstate is not updated.

3) User selects one such product e.g. 'Jacket' and is forwarded to 'configuration' page where there may be large number of configuration settings (e.g. 30-40 settings in case of jacket, ~100 settings in shirt etc.) he may set e.g. style, fabric, color, number of buttons & pockets.

-------------------

I have an ASP.NET 4.0 application which has a LOT of legacy URL rewrites. I want to build an HTTP module that will look at a database of these rewrites and do a 301 redirect if needed. There's tens of thousands of records in this table. 

So obviously I need to do some sort of caching so I'm not hitting the database and searching through all those records for each page request.

One of our requirements is to have a fast start up time when our application recycles for some reason (worker process recycles or what have you). So I don't want to load the whole table at app start up. The app start up is already excruciatingly slow.

My brilliant/ridiculous idea is to, 

 1. At app start up in my HttpModule create an empty dictionary to hold rewrites.
 2. Start a background worker thread. The app continues starting up.
 3. The background worker thread updates the dictionary with say, oh, the most 1000 most used rewrites. 

Questions

My questions are: 

 1. Is this ridiculous?
 2. Is there such a thing as
    a thread-safe dictionary? The
    background thread might be updating
    the dictionary while new requests
    are coming in.

The app requires html templates localization for several languages. I decided to go with asp.net resource files since the email layout is not likely to change and the amount of keys needed was relatively small. 

I'm using Global Resources and have around 15 different resource files for the required locales. I have my default resource file in English (""EmailTemplates.resx"") and then several localized resource files (""EmailTemplates.ru-RU.resx"", ""EmailTemplates.zh-CN.resx"", ""EmailTemplates.it-IT.resx"", ""EmailTemplates.id-ID.resx"", etc).

Among the resource files, I have two arabic ones: ""EmailTemplates.ar-AE.resx"" which is actually in English and ""EmailTemplates.ar-SA.resx"" which is in Arabic. 

All the emails for non Arabic locales work perfectly. The app picks up the required locale and uses the corresponding resource files. But when I try to request the Arabic ones, it always fall back to the default resource file.

The way I'm setting up the culture is based on the data requested, and not the browser settings:

    Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture = new CultureInfo(culture);
    Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentCulture = CultureInfo.CreateSpecificCulture(culture);

While debugging I can see that the CultureInfo is properly set to ""ar-SA"" or ""ar-AE"" but when the app retrieves the corresponding resource value, it always picks up the default one.

I have entered Arabic data in the default resource file for testing purposes, and the Arabic text displays just fine, so I'm sure that it is not a font or HTML layout issue. 

I have searched all around the Internet, proved different approaches, and no luck. The ""ar-SA"" and ""ar-AE"" are valid CultureInfo values and the app compiles without issues, but it seems that whenever I request the Arabic emails, the app can't find the Arabic resource files.

Any ideas? I'd really appreciate any hits and help !

Cheers!

I'm a software engineering student and have been looking for quite some time to get serious about web developpement.

I have played with a little bit of PHP in a recent project I'm doing with some friends but nothing major. So I was wondering : **should I learn PHP or ASP.NET**?

I have searched around for answer but haven't found a perfect answer yet. The documentation on the PHP website is great, there are a ton of PHP hosts out there and it seems to be very easy to learn. But at the same time, most people I know (in fact almost all of them) who knows one of both language knows PHP, so wouldn't learning ASP.NET differientiate me from the pack? Also, being a MSDNAA member, I have access to the entire Microsoft stack, so I guess it would be as easy to get started as with a LAMP stack?

Also, being a MSDNAA member, I have access to the entire Microsoft stack, so I guess it would be as easy to get started as with a LAMP stack?

I have a good background in C/C++ and have solid skills in XHTML/CSS/Javascript. So given my situation, should I start with ASP.NET or PHP? (I do plan on learning both at some point)",2

Another thing that worries me a bit is if I successfully force 404 error on any query string entries that don't have a match in my db, wouldn't that affect the main.aspx page itself effectively affecting all my existing pages as well? Here is what I mean:

I 404 main.aspx?page=Non-Existing-Title, however my 404 affects main.aspx with any query strings including valid ones, for example main.aspx?page=Existing-Title.

",asp.net,seo,http-status-code-404,seo-friendly,,,open,0,285,3,"ASP.NET Custom 404 I have a database driven ASP.NET site, which uses a single APSX page to display all site pages. So all the URLs of the site are in the following format:

    /main.aspx?page=Page+Title+One
    
    /main.aspx?page=Another+Article+Title

Unfortunately Google has indexed many non-existent URLs, mostly cutting part of the query string. For example:

    /main.aspx?page=Page+Title or /main.aspx?page=Page

instead of the correct one:

    /main.aspx?page=Page+Title+One (this is indexed by Google as well of course).

What I'm trying to achieve is, if the query string page name doesn't have a matching entry in my DB, to force a 404 error server side, first for better user experience and second to tell Google that these pages don't exist.

Here is my code and is not working. I mean it just displays an empty page in IE 8, and error in the latest Firefox:

    System.Web.HttpContext.Current.Response.Clear();
    System.Web.HttpContext.Current.Response.StatusCode = 404;
    System.Web.HttpContext.Current.Response.Status = ""404 Not Found"";
    System.Web.HttpContext.Current.Response.End();

I see the proper 404 code in my logs however I don't get redirected to my error page specified in my web.config:

    <customErrors mode=""On"">
          <error statusCode=""404"" redirect=""404.aspx""/>
    </customErrors>

Last time I used ASP.NET was in 2006, and even then, I did not used most of the things that ASP.NET makes available. I did not use Web Forms, did not use any Integrated Security features, nothing. I was asked to develop an intranet application, and the only requirement was that, it had to be built in ASP.NET. Well I had worked before with classic ASP, but after that moved to the Java world, and done some development using Servlets with MVC patterns, hence I was quite reluctant to use any Web Forms stuff. So instead, I did all of the front end development using JavaScript with AJAX calls to empty ASP.Net pages, which were acting like Controllers. In the end everybody was happy, we did have a very nice laid interface which was also very fast, and I was also happy because I had not been forced to use Web Forms. I haven't worked with ASP.NET ever since, I've been working mainly with Windows Forms, and since 2009, I moved to WPF/Silverlight development, so as it seems I did miss a couple of things when it comes to Web Development. The truth is that nowadays, I hear a lot of developers talking about MVC, like if it was something out of this world, but I really cannot understand all this hype.

If I was asked to build a web site, I would use, plain HTML/JavaScript/Ajax, with some REST web services in the back-end, I guess a lot of people would do it this way too, but what I cannot understand is why are people using ASP.NET MVC, what does it bring?

I can understand people using, now classic ASP.NET, because by using Web Forms, development for less experienced web developers is a lot easier and faster, but when it comes down to ASP.NET MVC, I am completely lost.

In an effort to fire my Application_Start, I've cycled the application by IIS, changing the Web.config, cycling the ApplicationPool, stopping/starting World Wide Web Publishing Service, and still no joy.

My other methods in Global.asax.cs are fired (Application_BeginRequest and Session_Start work fine).

While troubleshooting, I did notice that when trying to set an Application variable:


    Application(""appStartDT"") = DateTime.Now.ToString();


I got:


    The name 'Application' does not exist in the current context

	

This tells me I might have HttpApplication problem, but I don't see any problems with my namespace:

(So, only a certain section of the page would be displayed)

For example:  
1) You have a large application with many entities (Customers, Products, Stores, etc, etc etc)  
2) Each entity has an EntityDetails aspx page

Now, say from an Invoice screen that shows many entities of different types, I would like to be able to mouseover (or click a small icon) an entity, and have a little tooltip style modal ajax window popup, and what is shown will be the PORTION of the corresponding EntityDetails aspx page that was designated as available for rendering as a popup.
Obviously, the corresponding aspx arguments identifying the specific entity would have to be passed from the page as well.

So to do this, ** I think the requested page would have to be rendered in memory on the server **, and then the innerhtml would have to be pulled out of the designated div, and returned to the calling page, which would then display this html in a popup ajax window.
So, unless there is an easier way to do this that I am missing, how would this rendering be done on the server?

Has anyone seen this done before, is there any sort of a pre-existing framework or anything to do this?

And to complicate things further, would it be possible to have the popup form be editable and saved back to the server utilizing the existing asp.net form mechanism already embedded within the existing page (if the calling form already had an asp.net form....I think only one form is allowed per page, correct?)

And of course, opening the EntityDetails form via a simple javascript popup or new window is not what I am looking for.  And I do not want to have to embed the details form on each page where I may want it to display...every form in the application could conceivably call any other as a popup.

Thanks!

I've asked a few questions on this area the last few days, and i've hinted to this issue - but thought it's worthwhile to break it out into it's own question.

Because the class is abstract and all the methods are virtual, this means we can create our own custom cache providers.

According to MSDN, `ObjectCache` does not have to be a singleton, and you can create multiple instances of it in your application. Fine.

But to me, this sounds like we need to manage the instantiation and lifetime of this object as well?

I have an ASP.NET MVC 3 Web Application, with [StructureMap][2] as my dependency injection container.

I want to have a single, shared cache for my entire web application.

So, i create a very simple class which wraps the `ObjectCache` class, and provides the unboxing in the methods implementation. 

The class takes an instance of `ObjectCache` in the ctor, and sets this to a **private static** instance of the cache, which the methods (Add, Get, etc) work off.

E.g

    public class CacheManager
    {
       private static ObjectCache _cache;
    
       public CacheManager(ObjectCache cache)
       {
          _cache = cache;
       }
    
       // Add, Get, Remove methods work off _cache instance.
    }

Now, here's my DI registry:

    For<CacheManager>().Singleton().Use<CacheManager>().Ctor<ObjectCache>(""cache"").Is(MemoryCache.Default);

In english: **When something requests a CacheManager instance, use a singleton instance, and set the ObjectCache parameter to be a MemoryCache instance.**

So there's what i have, now the questions:

1. If i have a class to wrap the `ObjectCache`, does this class need to be a singleton?
2. MSDN says `ObjectCache` is thread-safe, but now that i'm using a singleton, do i need any type of locking to keep the thread safety?
3. Does the private instance of `ObjectCache` in my wrapper class need to be static? Does the class itself need to be static?
4. General thoughts on my overall implementation?

I have not been able to find a decent blog/article on .NET ObjectCache in ASP.NET Web Applications, hence my confusion. 

I'm use to using `HttpContext.Current.Cache` (which is static) and not care about lifetime management for the cache.

obviously this is encapsulated inside a SiteMaster. The View takes in the model and spits out the various information regarding the user nominated along with a Reject and Approve Button. This buttons value should be set to the particular thing the user wishes to do and there is a hidden input field thats value is the Nomination GUID which is recieved via the database. The first round works great, but after that is completed, when the view returns from the HttpPost, all the hidden values now have the same value (GUID). The value happens to also always be the same as the GUID or row that was just approved/rejected. Any ideas on what could be holding this value? There is no ViewData that the programmer used that I can see and no errors in the View? I have tried stepping through the View's foreach loop when the post returns and they are all different, but by the time it gets to the browser, they are all the same value?? Very strange and hard to pin point.

Any suggestions??

The Class that the View is getting from is:

 

     public class NominationStruct
        {
            public string NominationID; // unique ID in DB

obviously this is encapsulated inside a SiteMaster. The View takes in the model and spits out the various information regarding the user nominated along with a Reject and Approve Button. This buttons value should be set to the particular thing the user wishes to do and there is a hidden input field thats value is the Nomination GUID which is recieved via the database. The first round works great, but after that is completed, when the view returns from the HttpPost, all the hidden values now have the same value (GUID). The value happens to also always be the same as the GUID or row that was just approved/rejected. Any ideas on what could be holding this value? There is no ViewData that the programmer used that I can see and no errors in the View? I have tried stepping through the View's foreach loop when the post returns and they are all different, but by the time it gets to the browser, they are all the same value?? Very strange and hard to pin point.

Any suggestions??

The Class that the View is getting from is:

 

     public class NominationStruct
        {
            public string NominationID; // unique ID in DB
            public string NomineeLogin;
            public string NominationReason;
            public string NominationReasonWithBreaks;
            public string NominatedBy;
            public string NominationStatus;
    
        }

And the Model is:

     public class NominationsListViewModel
        {
            public IList<NominationRow> NominationRows { get; set; }
            public string CurrentTab { get; set; }
        }

I have a UI built in WinForms.NET (v4.0 framework) with WCF back-end and EF4 model objects, that I am looking to port to the web.  UI is not huge and is not super complex and is structured well.  But it is not a super simple system either.  I am looking to pick a technology stack for the web-frontend that will target desktop & partially mobile platforms, provide a good development platform to build on, and facilitate code reuse across UI and back-end tiers...

I would rather avoid: 

- custom coding of UI-centric scripts, because they are hard to debug, non-compiled, usually a maintenance nightmare, almost always start to contain business logic, and duplicate some of the logic that back-end tiers have (especially validation)
- custom-coding for Desktop Web and Mobile Web UI's separately (although I realize that mobile web UI will likely contain fewer of data-entry screens and more reporting screens) 
- non-.NET technology stacks

I would love to:

- target the reporting capabilities of the system toward mobile web browsers
- not have to write a single line of script (javascript, jquery, etc.)
- utilize a good collection of controls that produces an elegant UI 
- use .NET for everything

The way I see it right now, I need to re-write this app in Silverlight, utilize a 3rd party UI framework like Telerik, and re-do the reports UI again for mobile platforms separately.  However, I'm rather concerned about the shelf-life of Silverlight and the needed to deploy a different architecture to deal with mobile platform.

Is there an ASP.NET/MVC/Ajax architecture/framework/library that would allow me to get at the power of .NET and without painful (imho) client-side scripting, while providing a decent user experience

We migrated to a new Windows 2008 server x64, where IIS site based Output caching was enabled.
Our application pool is set to x64 mode as well.
All went well, the application was running with some serious load and about ~ 2GB of memory usage. 

With no changes to the application, and no additional traffic, the application started to eat up all memory on the server, that is currently 7GB.

I've tried to disable Output caching, but it didn't help at all. The only way to deal with the problem is to recycle the application pool, but this solution results in the loss of all user sessions.

In my understanding, HttpRuntime.Cache items are global for the application pool.
We're only Inserting the items to the Cache on the Application Load event, so there should be no changes whatsoever to the cache items.

With disabled output caching and no additional inserts to the Cache, what could cause the unexpected memory growth?

 - Use the manual add of UrlRoutingMode (http://www.britishdeveloper.co.uk/2010/06/dont-use-modules-runallmanagedmodulesfo.html)

The pool in in integrated mode, 4.0. This server is running a lot of MVC3 pages, and they are using routing by default.

I am not asking if I should use DB or filesystem, the file system it is, but I am asking what is the best way of organizing pictures in file system that will be used with asp.net application?
I am talking about tens or even hundreds of thousands of picture.

To elaborate a question a bit.

 - Where should repository be located, create another VD in IIS or in application VD, or somewhere outside IIS?
 - How to organize file patsh, put them all in one folder or create subfolders. If so how to name all those folders?
 - How to handle multiple sizes of the same image? where to locate them?
 - How to sync folders and images with database?
 - What else crosses your mind, and you think it's important..


I've done something myself allready, but I am asking if someone had some experience with this. Maybe it could be done better yours way.

I put things like this

 - I stored pictures in IIS folder, because storing them outside of iis make them unable to use in web, because of paths. You cannot use file path in web, it must be virtual file path.  

    http://images/1.jpg istead of C:\images\1.jpg 

 - in the root I had subfolder for each picture size

     root-
         +400x300
         +600x400
         +1024x768

 - Named images by id from database. If the ImageID from database is 45678909, the name of picture is 45678909.jpg an it's location is 

    VD\images\400x300\45\67\89\45678909.jpg

    VD\images\600x400\45\67\89\45678909.jpg

I sliced the picture name two by two, and create subfolders. the point was not to have more than 100 files in folder. Was this good idea or stupid one? How would you organize this? For person, this organization with tons of folder is not easy to use.

 - Name of the picture i saved in database table with description and time of insert etc. 


Any suggestions or improvements?

 - Named images by id from database. If the ImageID from database is 45678909, the name of picture is 45678909.jpg an it's location is 

    VD\images\400x300\45\67\89\45678909.jpg

    VD\images\600x400\45\67\89\45678909.jpg

I sliced the picture name two by two, and create subfolders. the point was not to have more than 100 files in folder. Was this good idea or stupid one? How would you organize this? For person, this organization with tons of folder is not easy to use.

 - Name of the picture i saved in database table with description and time of insert etc. 


Any suggestions or improvements?

Thanks :)

<ResourceDictionary Source=""/Library;component/Themes/Controls/Button/Template.xaml""/>

There's a footer for the MessageBox into Globals.xaml, footer uses a template from Template.xaml. It works perfectly but not in one case. I have a main window that dinamically create a plugin and open a window. This window is a regular Window Wpf application loaded through reflection. 
Method to open MessageBox is within the same DLL as Resource Dictionaries.

If I call this MessageBox method from the plugin it throws an exception because ""Footer"" is not found. I set a breakpoint before 

    window.ShowDialog();

And I see MergedDictionaries is empty into window. Also empty everywhere, only owner of this MessageBox contains those resources. Doing 

    window.FindResource(""key"");

Get a null value as expected. However, if I manually copy merged dictionaries using this code lines before open dialog:

    foreach (var dict in owner.Resources.MergedDictionaries)
    {
        window.Resources.MergedDictionaries.Add(dict);

And then look for window.FindResource(""key"") I can see the style, but even though it continues throwing an exception:

Footer style is used in this line of MessageBox:

I've also tried to declare this resource into the DialogWindow in the library, even when I've not gonna be allowed to change it:

A lot of the data we retreive via NHibernate is stored in `System.Web.Caching.Cache`. 

`System.Web.Caching.Cache` does a lot to increase the responsiveness of an application, but there are a few issues that we don't exactly know how to resolve, such as

1. when a user requests data on server1 that data is cached on server1, but for their next request, the load balancer might direct them to server2. That data they requested on server1 is no longer available, and server2 will have to request it from the database again.

2. If the user does something on server1 to invalidate the cached data, the cache is flushed on server1. However the original cache is still available on server2 & server3, so when the user submits a subsequent request and they're directed to either of the other servers, they are going to be presented with invalid data.

3. We have applications that update data (such as performance data) on a regular basis. When the performance data is updated we want to flush this from the cache so when a user requests the data again, they're presented with the latest data. How can we get these applications to flush the cache on 3 web servers?

What are the best ways to resolve these issues?  


Should we have cache stored on a separate server such as we could to for `HttpContext.Session` with a SessionState server?   

Is there a way for us to set a Cache Dependency on the Cache in the other 2 servers?

What web architecture would you experts suggest? Is there any performance tests published to back up your conclusion? (Especially performance testing on sites built with MVC vs. Web Pages.) And what IDE do you recommend to use for such development?

So far, my own investigations seem to point in direction of Web Pages (excluding MVC) using include files or classes for separating the #C code from HTML where simple Razor snippets can not do the trick, and ADO.NET to access the SPs in the DB.  Since WebMatrix seems not to support creation of classes(?), I may need to use Express Web Developer.  VisualStudio is of course also an option, but I like the idea of a simpler (and free) IDE.  However, I’m feeling a bit unsure on this strategy and will appreciate any comments and advice!  Many thanks!

This should be system very similar to box.com where we can exchange documents with our clients. We will also allow the client to share documents with other users. Since we are relatively new to the SharePoint technology, we hired a vendor who persuaded us to use SharePoint technology for this product, and we’ve invested significant amount of money so far.

    System will have a SharePoint site for each client, around 12000 sites. Each site will have 3 document libraries. We will also create site for shared document users and a library in each of these shared user’s sites. In order to avoid item level security, we will have to either add all these users to each of the libraries in their respective client sites, or create site custom groups (we can’t use custom groups since Microsoft recommends only 10000 per site collection). Moreover, we will definitely have to use item level security for one of the libraries in which client users can upload documents and they are allowed to see only their uploaded documents. 

    Considering that our system will be used only to exchange documents in the first phase, and possible collaboration features for the next phase (we haven’t defined collaboration yet), do we really need:

         -12000+ sites, 
	-36000+ libraries,
	-complicated security model (more secure though), 
	-extra reading/writing document to database (we are using BLOBs technology) but   
               there is a lot of database reading/writing when you upload/download document
	-limitation of 250K sites per site collections 
	-increased difficulty of creating web parts, event receivers, workflows, timer 
               jobs, web templates, features and other custom code
	-more difficult way of updating UI (page layouts, web part zones, publishing  
               templates)


If we were going to do this in SP.NET we could have done it using few web forms, single database and file system for document storage.

               jobs, web templates, features and other custom code
	-more difficult way of updating UI (page layouts, web part zones, publishing  
               templates)


If we were going to do this in SP.NET we could have done it using few web forms, single database and file system for document storage.

Is SharePoint right technology for this system? Can you please give me some Pros and Cons?

2) When we checkin the changed code, we must not checkin the bin folder or anything in it. If we do, nobody else can compile their code. Again, is this correct?  

Bottom line, I am looking for some best practices advice. What is the best way to manage this development effort given the tools we are using?

Now, my website is running on City B's IIS and fetching data from local server is working fine. On the other hand the City A's IIS website is working and fetching the data from their local database server.

on City B server I have created a default.aspx page which have two linkbutton which say click this to see city B data and click this to see city A data.

so, when user click on city B linkbutton then the webpages run on their local, but when user click on city A linkbutton then via internet the city B peoples can view the data of City A.

So far so good, but on web pages their is button named as go to Main, so as city B accessing the web pages of City A and click on Main button then it showing the city A's default.aspx page.

So, my question is that, is there a way that my site can rectify that from where the page have been redirected and when main button click on either side it must see and show their own default.aspx pages. 

I hope I am able to express my scenario. if not then please you may see the diagram, which may clear you what I am asking for.

I'm making a computer packet calculator application, basically the users can select components he/she wants into his/her computer packet from a drop down list and then send the order into a email. The components must come from a database.

I'm not familiar with the MVC model so I haven't quite understood in which folder should I put which part of the application. Right now I have

**-Controllers:**

--HomeController

**-Models**

--HomeRepository

--IHomeRepository

--Database.dbml (right now I only use a table called product and the information that I need from there is 

product_description and product_price)

**-Views**

--Home

---- Index

---- ... etc ...


I have managed to get all products from products table into a bulleted list and show it at Index page. So, my HomeRepository makes a datacontext from Database.dbml. There is also a public IList<product> ListAll() method (?) where the search sentence is written. IHomeRepository has only

    public interface IHomeRepository
    {
      IList<product> ListAll();

       }
    }



But it shows only as many Drop Down List as I get products from the search sentence and it show only one result in every list.

What should I do? Or how should I build this kind of application? Perhaps Web Forms should be easier to do this simple application but I need to try to use the methods of eXtreme Programming, including Test Driven Development and I understood that that isn't possible with Web Forms.

I've been told to research on AD LDS + AD FS to make this happen within limited time, whether or not it is possible to support both domain credential SSO (both internal & external) and automatic sign-in for intranet domain users. 

As I read related documentations and discussions in the forums, I understand that SSO is possible with this setup, however I cannot be certain and unable to find related materials mentioning about ""automatic signing"" intranet domain users with this environment.
 
Can anyone please advice if it is possible or if there are alternative approaches.

I've been told to research on AD LDS + AD FS to make this happen within limited time, whether or not it is possible to support both domain credential SSO (both internal & external) and automatic sign-in for intranet domain users. 

As I read related documentations and discussions in the forums, I understand that SSO is possible with this setup, however I cannot be certain and unable to find related materials mentioning about ""automatic signing"" intranet domain users with this environment.
 
Can anyone please advice if it is possible or if there are alternative approaches. 
The main thing is that we want to avoid joining that existing web server to the domain.

Many thanks

>***""Avoid Asynchronous Calls Unless You Have Additional Parallel Work***

>*Make asynchronous calls from your Web application only when your application has additional parallel work to perform while it waits for the completion of the asynchronous calls, and the work performed by the asynchronous call is not CPU bound. **Internally, the asynchronous calls use a worker thread from the thread pool; in effect, you are using additional threads.***

>*At the same time that you make asynchronous I/O calls, such as calling a Web method or performing file operations, the thread that makes the call is released so that it can perform additional work, such as making other asynchronous calls or performing other parallel tasks. You can then wait for completion of all of those tasks. Making several asynchronous calls that are not CPU bound and then letting them run simultaneously can improve throughput.*

This is confusing to me.  My understanding was that when you make an asynchronous I/O call that no thread is used while waiting, but that an IOCP is set with a reference to your callback method.  Is it true that you should only use async calls when you have parallel work?  My understanding was that for an ASP.NET Web Service, it is often a good idea to change a WebMethod **Foo** to **BeginFoo/EndFoo** when you will be calling an I/O bound operation and implement the whole thing asynchronously.

Can someone help me understand what is meant by “asynchronous calls use a worker thread from the thread pool; in effect, you are using additional threads”, and the difference between WorkerThreads and IO-threads?

the above routine i use to re-index and the code is working but i think this is not right way for re-indexing data.
why i said it is not right code for index because here i specify true in this line `IndexModifier modWriter = new IndexModifier(dir, new StandardAnalyzer(), true)`
which means create the index again....as a result the code i wrote which will create index again instead of update i think so. i need to modify index based on ID & type because my data would be unique based on ID & type. so that is why i add this line

              modWriter.DeleteDocuments(new Lucene.Net.Index.Term(""ID"", oData.ID.ToString()));
              modWriter.DeleteDocuments(new Lucene.Net.Index.Term(""Type"", oData.Type));

                }

the above routine i use to re-index and the code is working but i think this is not right way for re-indexing data.
why i said it is not right code for index because here i specify true in this line `IndexModifier modWriter = new IndexModifier(dir, new StandardAnalyzer(), true)`
which means create the index again....as a result the code i wrote which will create index again instead of update i think so. i need to modify index based on ID & type because my data would be unique based on ID & type. so that is why i add this line

              modWriter.DeleteDocuments(new Lucene.Net.Index.Term(""ID"", oData.ID.ToString()));
              modWriter.DeleteDocuments(new Lucene.Net.Index.Term(""Type"", oData.Type));

i am not good in lucene.net. so please guide me how could i modify index. the whole code running in my local pc. thanks

The application is fairly large Asp.Net Webforms app, with all data setting / retrieval happening through Web Services.  Currently, these WebServices return DataSets, containing 1 or more tables returned from Stored Procedures.  The codebase is quite tightly connected, with the ASP code-behind calling the WebServices in multiple places, and most of the business logic happening either in the code-behind or in the Stored Procedures.

For a while now, we have been looking at possible ways to update the application, and modernize the code-base.  We can't (and don't want to) re-write the whole app, but it would be great if we could start moving it, bit by bit, towards a newer architecture.  I have looked into the [MVP](http://webformsmvp.com/) architecture, which seems like it would be a nice match to our current architecture - it won't involve too much re-writing, but should still result in more testable code (another goal - we currently have no automated testing).

I'd like to know, though, if any one has some tips / information / articles on moving from DataSets to EntityFramework.  I feel that this would result in the biggest advantage for us, since it would allow us to model our data and test it much easier.

I need to show a drop down list when the page loads, the default selected value is nothing, or an empty element (such as ""-""). When the user selects one value from the list, another drop down list is added below the first one, and so on.

My problem with this is how you make the page to remember the drop down lists created through postbacks and the values they have selected? Do I have to use some kind of array to store them or something?

Thank you very much.

For example, say I have a table ""Company"", and I just want to render a textbox for all the columns.

One trick that I thought I saw and confirmed to work was to do some markup like so:  

    <p><label for=""zzzz"">zzzz</label><asp:TextBox ID=""zzzz"" Text='<%# Bind(""zzzz"")%>' runat=""server"" /></p>
    <p><label for=""zzzz"">zzzz</label><asp:TextBox ID=""zzzz"" Text='<%# Bind(""zzzz"")%>' runat=""server"" /></p>
    <p><label for=""zzzz"">zzzz</label><asp:TextBox ID=""zzzz"" Text='<%# Bind(""zzzz"")%>' runat=""server"" /></p>
    <p><label for=""zzzz"">zzzz</label><asp:TextBox ID=""zzzz"" Text='<%# Bind(""zzzz"")%>' runat=""server"" /></p>
    <p><label for=""zzzz"">zzzz</label><asp:TextBox ID=""zzzz"" Text='<%# Bind(""zzzz"")%>' runat=""server"" /></p>
    <p><label for=""zzzz"">zzzz</label><asp:TextBox ID=""zzzz"" Text='<%# Bind(""zzzz"")%>' runat=""server"" /></p>

Basically, one per row in your database table.

Then, select (in SQL Server):  

    select * from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS where table_name = 'Company'

Highlight the COLUMN_NAME column in the resulting output and copy to clipboard.

Then, using the ALT+drag trick to highlight a vertical column, highlight the zzzz's in your markup (starting from the right so things keep lining up), and paste the column names over top.  I swear I saw this done in a video, and I tried it myself and it worked, but tonight I can't seem to make it work. 

Of course, an even better way to do this would be through T4 or some kind of code generation like that, and just have every table render default html into a folder such as \CodeGen\EditForms where you could copy and paste from, but for that I don't know where to start.

What I'm trying to do is testing of my data access layer where I use LINQ data context class to execute a certain function and return a result,however during the debugging process I found out that all the tests fail as soon as they get to the LINQ data context class and it has something to do with the connection string but I cant figure out what is the problem.

The debugging of tests fails here(the second line):

    public EICDataClassesDataContext() :
        base(global::System.Configuration.ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings[""EICDatabaseConnectionString""].ConnectionString, mappingSource)
		{
			OnCreated();
		}
And my test is as follows:

    TestMethod()]
        public void OnGetCustomerIDTest()
        {
            FrontLineStaffDataAccess target = new FrontLineStaffDataAccess(); // TODO: Initialize to an appropriate value
            string regNo = ""jonh""; // TODO: Initialize to an appropriate value
            int expected = 10; // TODO: Initialize to an appropriate value
            int actual;
            actual = target.OnGetCustomerID(regNo);
            Assert.AreEqual(expected, actual);
        }
The method which I call from DAL is:

     public int OnGetCustomerID(string regNo)
        {
            using (LINQDataAccess.EICDataClassesDataContext dataContext = new LINQDataAccess.EICDataClassesDataContext())
            {
                IEnumerable<LINQDataAccess.GetCustomerIDResult> sProcCustomerIDResult = dataContext.GetCustomerID(regNo);
                int customerID = sProcCustomerIDResult.First().CustomerID;

                return customerID;
            }
        }

So basically everything fails after it reaches the 1st line of DA layer method and when it tries to instantiate the LINQ data access class...

When the view loads using GET, it shows a list of programs (in a table) available in the database. It lists only 5 programs (max) randomly. There are two buttons provided

1)	Show March Programs.  When this button is clicked the  table should show only programs that is scheduled for March month.

2)	Show 2012 Programs. When this button is clicked the  table should show only programs that is scheduled for year 2012.


How do we achieve it?  

Based on MVC principle: `The UI logic belongs in the view. Input logic belongs in the controller. Business logic belongs in the model.`

1) How do we achieve it in quick way?

2) How do we achieve it standard way (following MVC principle listed above)

I have a form, within it is a div which is hidden (using ""display: none"") at load time.  This div is later displayed via the BlockUI plugin as a modal dialog for the editing of certain input elements.  I'm trying to get the validation plugin to check that the fields I have denoted as required are actually filled in by the end user.

I have used the validation plugin elsewhere in my app without any problems, but this is the first time I'm using it to validate inputs that are hidden at load time.  The validations aren't being executed (i.e. empty text inputs that are marked as required aren't flagged as such, and .valid() returns true).

I stepped through the validation logic with Firebug and discovered that none of the input elements within the dialog div are present within $(this.currentForm).  If I keep the dialog div visible and remove the $.blockUI call, then the validation works as expected.

So I think I know what the problem is now -- my inputs aren't in the DOM, because they were originally not visible, so the validation plugin doesn't know they exist.  I'm not sure how to fix this.  Can anyone offer a suggestion?   Thanks!

I did have all of my code in the `Page_Load` but I read a post that was very similar to the problem I am having and that was solved by using the `Page_Init` for code to grab the session from the textbox.

I don't think I put the right code in the `Page_Init`. In debug mode, each line says `IB` is `Nothing`. Can someone help me with this? I've not used `Page_Init` before so it's very possible that I'm doing this wrong.

I implemented passive view MVP pattern and all presenters are connected from view by event handling.

The scenario is displaying a detail popup box from master list by clicking the link on master row.

I have to make an ajax call to display the detail list. Now my question is how can I make a call via Ajax from client side to invoke an event.

There are 2 scenarios in AJAX call that I know:
1. Call Page Method:
    In this, How can I call a page method (this is static by default) which internally invoke a event in presenter?
  
    If I call a presenter method directly in my view then It is violating the MVP pattern.

2. Call Web Service:
     How can I call a Web Service (Where it should be created?) how the presenter handle this service?

   

I googled so many sites but I couldn't find a right answer to implement.

Kalyan P",asp.net,ajax,mvp,,,,open,0,183,5,"Ajax Call in MVP asp.Net I am working on a small project with MVP implementation using Ajax, JQuery.

I implemented passive view MVP pattern and all presenters are connected from view by event handling.

The scenario is displaying a detail popup box from master list by clicking the link on master row.

I have to make an ajax call to display the detail list. Now my question is how can I make a call via Ajax from client side to invoke an event.

There are 2 scenarios in AJAX call that I know:
1. Call Page Method:
    In this, How can I call a page method (this is static by default) which internally invoke a event in presenter?
  
    If I call a presenter method directly in my view then It is violating the MVP pattern.

2. Call Web Service:
     How can I call a Web Service (Where it should be created?) how the presenter handle this service?

   

I googled so many sites but I couldn't find a right answer to implement.

Please clarify my questions and thanks for your support.


Thanks

","I have some content from a CMS that I need to move to raw asp.net pages. Since the templates are nested I guess I can use nested masterpages to acomplish it, but I'm finding that I can't set values on the top masterpage from the deep child page. 

Here is a sample. I have several nested masterpages with contentplaceholders: 

* top master (with contentPlaceHolder1)
* nested master, dependent on top master (with contentPlaceHolder2)
* aspx page, dependent on nested master, defines content for contentPlaceHolder1 and 2

The problem is that asp.net doesn't allow me to have the value of contentPlaceHolder1 defined in the content page, it should be defined in the nested master. But the point is that the client page knows that value, not the template masters (for instance, the page knows about the graphic it has to display on the the top, but the placeholder for the graphic is the top master).

During the day there are times when i try to execute (through my application) method A, I dont get a response, But method B works fine.

 In other times this behaviour is reversed - Method A response But B is not. 

They both connect to the same Database and ,as mentioned, are part of the same webservice.
What seems to solve it is updating (Not really changing anything in it) the web.config in my hosted site (I guess it causes the application in the iis to recycle).

Is it possible that I can direct www.akshayj.com to any free web server (web hosting) ? Please share if anyone knows any such free service(asp.net and sql sevver).  


Now if I do that, my website address will still look like www.akshayj.com/pages/index.aspx or will it be anything different(www.freehostingprovidr.com/akshayj/pages/index.aspx) and what are the setting I have to do to redirect to this free web hosting server?

I want to create a website, say www.akshayj.com.The first thing I would do is to register the domain, and for that there are websites like godaddy and it's paid service. This is necessary for directing www.akshayj.com to the ip address of the web server where my asp.net pages will run.  

Is it possible that I can direct www.akshayj.com to any free web server (web hosting) ? Please share if anyone knows any such free service(asp.net and sql sevver).  


Now if I do that, my website address will still look like www.akshayj.com/pages/index.aspx or will it be anything different(www.freehostingprovidr.com/akshayj/pages/index.aspx) and what are the setting I have to do to redirect to this free web hosting server?

As the title suggests, I'm trying to inject a doctype at runtime on a page-by-page basis.

The application uses a single master with a gazillion content pages, so naturally I've tried inserting an `asp:contentplaceholder` control on the master, and using an `asp:content` control on the content page.  This works in that the doctype element shows up when you view source, but it doesn't work in that the browser (IE8) is still running in Quirks mode for some god-forsaken reason. 

Here's the placeholder on the master:

    <asp:contentplaceholder id=""doctype"" runat=""server"" />

Here's the content panel on the page:

    <asp:content contentplaceholderid=""doctype"" runat=""server"" >
        <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC ""-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN""
            ""http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd"">
    </asp:content>

I'm a bit baffled as to why this isn't working, since the replacement should happen server-side, then the output gets sent to the browser with the doctype already in place...

Why am I doing this?
--------------------

I'm only doing this because specifying a doctype on the master means I would then need to go and fix the gazillion content pages before I can even begin to work on the assigned task. If I can figure out a way to inject a doctype via certain content pages, then I can effectively fix one page at a time until they are finished.

Which browsers does this affect?
--------------------------------

*Internet Explorer 8* is our primary target.  It is, ironically, the browser that is effectively ignoring the injected doctype.  When checking `document.doctype` at runtime after the DOM is loaded, it's returning `null`.

*Firefox* behaves differently.

I'm a bit baffled as to why this isn't working, since the replacement should happen server-side, then the output gets sent to the browser with the doctype already in place...

Why am I doing this?
--------------------

I'm only doing this because specifying a doctype on the master means I would then need to go and fix the gazillion content pages before I can even begin to work on the assigned task. If I can figure out a way to inject a doctype via certain content pages, then I can effectively fix one page at a time until they are finished.

Which browsers does this affect?
--------------------------------

*Internet Explorer 8* is our primary target.  It is, ironically, the browser that is effectively ignoring the injected doctype.  When checking `document.doctype` at runtime after the DOM is loaded, it's returning `null`.

*Firefox* behaves differently. This technique actually works in Firefox, but doesn't really help [me] since all of our users are stuck with Internet Explorer 8.",2

I have double and triple checked the setting including the directory security settings.  It allows anonymous.  I turned off Windows Authentication.

If I delete the application and the folder its in, then redeploy it under the same application name it magically reapplies the old settings.

I want to improve the client experience by exposing some of my objects through WCF(JSON).  I have this working fine but where I am unsure is how to handle derived objects(not sure if that is the correct term) or IEnumerable anonymous objects if you will.

Let's say I have 3 tables structured like so:

**Templates**
ID
Template

**Groups**
ID
Group

**Instances**
ID
TemplateID
GroupID

This is obviously a one-to-many type relationship.  I have my navigation properties setup correctly and getting strongly typed object properties works great.  However, how do I send serialized anonymous type object(s) over the wire.  Like an object that sends all instances that are equal to groupid=1 and include the names of the template and the object.

Am I missing something or do I have to create another class object for WCF that would look like this:

**WCF Object**
InstanceID
TemplateID
TemplateName
GroupID
GroupName

I guess I could alter my tables to account for this but that seems wrong too.  I know that IEnumerable objects can't be serialized and I know that throw away objects are probably not the way to go either. I want to do this the right way but I am not sure how to go about it.

Your suggestions are appreciated.

              { key: 'IsActiveDisplay' },
              { key: 'Actions' }
         ]
    };

My action method to supply the data to the data table:

    public ActionResult JsonGetParentCategoryList()
    {
         IEnumerable<Category> categoryList = categoryService.GetAll();
    
         // Mapping
         IEnumerable<CategoryViewModel> viewModelList = (IEnumerable<CategoryViewModel>)categoryMapper.Map(

         };
    
         return Json(data, JsonRequestBehavior.AllowGet);
    }

The data table is loaded in my `Index` view and a category is added on my `Create` view.

    Internet Explorer

When I add a new category in IE then it gets added to the database, no issues with this.  When the grid loads for the first time it goes into `JsonGetParentCategoryList` action method and populates the data table.  If I were to refresh the page then it doesn't go into the `JsonGetParentCategoryList` action method, but the grid is still loaded.  If I were to add another category and then go back to my data table then it doesn't want to load the newer categories (after the data table was loaded for the first time).

    FireFox

In FireFox the opposite happens.  When I load the Index for the first time the data table is loaded with categories.  When I add a new category and go back to the data table then the newer categories are all loaded (even after the first time the grid was loaded).

Why is this the case and how would I solve it?  Is it something that needs to be set in IE?  I hope not because if my website has many users then I can't go and tell every user to adjust the setting.  Is it maybe something in the YUI data table that I need to set?

I like to ask your opinions about how much time (in hours/work-days) should be allocated to develop the following website (please take a look):

http://www.shabi-e-masoomeen.com

The website simply display products and have a form where users can submit an order. No online transaction is done. Products are divided in categories and sub-categories. 

Please keep in mind the following:

1. The design part is already completed. Only development part is left (that is the part the estimation is required for).

2. For AJAX only jQuery is used. No other AJAX library (including MS AJAX) is used.

3. The websites are made in C# and ASP.Net.

4. Development of websites includes development of the admin portion.

5. They are not CMS websites. The admin can only change contents, not controls or design.

6. Only unit testing is allowed. No time is allocated for any other tests (except running the website at localhost and checking functionality of each page). The tests not included are for example Integration, System etc.

7. No similar boiler-plate code is available. All the development needs to be done from scratch.

8. No inline-queries are allowed. All data logic must be in stored procedures. 

9. The database tables must be reasonably (that is not overly) normalized.

10. The classes are reasonably refactored.

11. There is only one developer in the team.

12. No time is allocated for any kind of documentation (including excessive in-code comments).

13. Maximum use of client-side scripting (including validation, data submission etc).

14. Assume that you are paying for development. At what duration of complete development you become 

(a) Delighted and surprised that the work is done so quick.
(b) Pleased but feel it could be fast.
(c) Satisfied but not happy. Next time you look for other developer.
(d) Pissed off. Somewhat angry but keep it to yourself.
(e) Furious. Extremely angry, yell and decide would never ever use this developer.

I don't see any advantage of using the built-in VS server and in fact many teams including myself that I've been on hate the VS built-in web server because of a few reasons:

 1. You have to maintain a port which can be a pain because everyone has to change it in the web project if their port # is different
 2. The VS web server itself is just funky at times.  It's not IIS so you end up with problems or errors that you wouldn't otherwise be getting in IIS necessarily and some errors are related to the nature of the VS web server.

Now why I like using IIS:

 1. All I have to do is toggle back to the browser  and just refresh the browser (F5) which will reflect whatever changes I made after compiling or not compiling (if I just updated mark-up or something).  To me using the built-in web server just takes much longer to get debugging and the site refreshed.  Yea you have to attach to the worker process manually in VS but at least I'm using the worker process directly here and see what's going on in case I have any weird issues during testing
 2. No need to worry about maintaining a port number in your url.  You just access the site you created in IIS, no port needed in the URL...so standard web development here that is...
 3. Just the fact that you're working with IIS, a real tool that's going to be used and is used in all your environments to deploy the site and what the site ultimately runs on is good because you have a lot of control but also you get to know IIS more which is very important.  I could care less how the VS web server runs or wtf it is under the covers...I don't use it in a production environment so it doesn't benefit me to use some means other than straight IIS here...pointless.

Now, I could be wrong on some of these points or I could be 100% right but wanted to know what people prefer and why.
