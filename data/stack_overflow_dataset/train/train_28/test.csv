I am making a page for editing Users. When the User's Devices collection needs to be edited, the view presents a table of Devices associated with the User, with Remove links next to each, and a table of Devices not currently associated with a User, with Add links. The view is typed to a viewmodel that contains both lists.

This is all within a partial view, so that (ideally) it can update dynamically with Ajax.

Unfortunately I am quite new to ASP.NET and MVC3, and to web development in general. How should I go about writing the view to implement this?

Most of my assumptions about how to implement this are based on [this][1] tutorial. He's doing something similar, but he's just using @Html.EditorFor and adding whatever the user types in the text field into the collection, not selecting an existing object. Presumably I need to send the ID of the selected device back to the controller, so it can move the device between lists and return the updated partial view. But the view is typed to the viewmodel, and (unless I'm mistaken) I can't send arbitrary data back to the controller in a post; I can only send the viewmodel. So it would seem I need to put the selected device's ID into the viewmodel before posting it back, but if I do that then I'm violating the whole MVC pattern by manipulating data in the view.

This is a pretty rudimentary problem so I'm sure there are plenty of solutions, but unfortunately I lack enough domain knowledge to even know how to look for one.

I have an ASP.Net MVC application in which it calls out to a WCF service to get back the ViewModels that will be rendered.  (the reason it's using a WCF service is so that other small MVC apps may also call on for these ViewModels...only internally, it's not a publicly available thing so I can change anything either side of the service.  The idea is to move the logic that was in the website, closer to the server/database so the roundtrips aren't so costly - and only do one roundtrip overall from the webserver to the database server).

There are lots of common little bits of functionality, but each page may want to display different subsets of these things (so homepage maybe a list of tables, next page, a list of tables and users that are available).

So what's the best way of returning the information that the page wants, hopefully without the webservice knowing about the page?

One of the parts of the workflow is to print invoice after it was published. This means that the website user is able to select 10-20(and more) invoices and print it at once. Also there may be several invoice templates which may be customizable(this is one of the key requirements).

I should also mention that we decide to generate PDFs from the html code and then print it. So as the PDF creation process may take some time to complete we decided to use a windows service for invoices printing.

 2. The website user should be

Our first idea was to use user controls as invoice templates. The user control will be responsible for invoice layout. This also means there will be a base class for these user controls through which we will be able to define a data source for the controls.
In this case we may even allow users to modify ascx file (or something similar) to edit basic captions if necessary.

The problem begins in the windows service where we are unable to generate output for user controls. So the other solution is to use http handler or web service to generate user controls output and transfer this to the windows service.

I've used MasterPages, 'Web User Controls' for things like headers, navigation, footers etc.

One thing I have never truly understood is the practice of using 'Web User Controls' for your content and logic;

    Home.aspx ------ Home.ascx
    AboutUs.aspx ----- AboutUs.ascx
    Ordering.aspx ---- Ordering.acsx

I've been working with a few projects over the last few months that use this structure. I am aware that this is actually common practice but I don't really understand the full benefits.

I remember when I tried this approach before and ended up having awful viewstate problems with controls like the Gridview... once I took all the logic out and placed it into a .aspx page everything worked fine.

I realise now that maybe I needed to add the Gridview to the viewstate collection... but this only reinforces my difficulty into understanding why this approach is used - given the viewstate problem.

 I fully understand the advantages of 'Web User Controls' in relation to things like Headers, menus, footers etc... anywhere that involves duplication but the projects I've seen have pages/controls that are pretty specific - in other words its unlikely to be reused anywhere else - the aspx page just contains a control (.ascx) with the content and logic and it will only be used on that page, nowhere else.

And here's the error I'm getting:  
`Could not find a part of the path 'c:\windows\system32\inetsrc\~\Submenus.xml'.`

Menu2 is just a completely empty `<asp:Menu>` control directly under the main menu on the page.

Can someone tell me what I'm doing wrong please?

Thanks in advance.",5

However I noticed there are too many things to change on my existing aspx pages (i.e. links to javascript, links to css files). So that I decided to instead of URL rewrite I now want to do a redirect. But I am not sure how I can tell my CustomRouteHandler to do the actul redirect than URL rewrite.

I always tend to experiment with Parent/Child presentation when learning a new UI platform, so that is where I have started here. Thinking I should use ASP.NET 2.0, I am studying the various ways of architecting a UI form which contains a master list of Parent records, and then showing the related children records in a second grid on the page when you click on a parent. Eventually, even the child records are parents to other children, so I'll need to deal with that also.

Think: Customers with Open Orders / Open Orders for Selected Customer / Line Items on Selected Open Order... like this screen where I built the same thing in WPF: [http://www.twitpic.com/26w26][1]

Some of techniques I've seen simply creates a plain old-shcool table of href links for the parents, with some method call to query the children based on the selected parent, while some techniques I've seen use the ASP.NET 2.0 data controls to work all this out. Are the ASP.NET 2.0 data controls cheating? Do real developers use these out-of-the box controls, or do they output their own HTML so they can have more control?

Also, it seems like ASP.NET MVC is all the rage right now, so I though I should consider that. When I looked at a few intro's about it, it seems to take a step back in time as it looks like you have to manually create much the HTML to present lists and datagrids, rather than being able to use the ASP.NET 2.0 controls.

I'm kinda lost as to where to spend my energy.

 then if i go to the email, i should have receive the link, once i click on it should prompt me to my website where it has a 2 textbox; reset new password and confirm reset new password

Should i design my website for it?,"I'm running a ASP.NET website, the server both reads and writes data to a database but also stores some frequently accessed data directly in the process memory as a cache. When new requests come in they are processed depending on data in the cache before it's written to the DB.

My hosting provider suddenly decided to put their servers under a load balancer. This means that my caching system will go bananas as several servers randomly processes the requests. So i have to rewrite a big chunk of my application only to get worse performance since i now have to query the database instead of a lightning fast in memory variable check.

First i don't really see the point of distributing the load on the iis server as in my experience DB queries are most often the bottleneck, now the DB has to take even more banging. Second, it seems like these things would require careful planning, not just something a hosting provider would set up for all their clients and expect all applications to be written to suit them. 


Are these sort of things common or was i stupid using the process memory as cache in the first place? 

Should i start looking for a new hosting provider or can i expect web farming to arrive sooner or later anywhere? Should I keep transitions like this in consideration for all future apps i write and avoid in process caching and similar designs completely?

If I don't use Bind(), and only use Eval() functionality, it works.  In that way, the error is especially confusing.   Here's the simplified codeset that still produces the error:

I've looked around the web and tried all of the provided solutions without much luck. I've tried using many different iTunes COM libraries (even the one that's on Apple's developer website), still no luck. The issue is, when I'm using Visual Studio's development server to create an instance of the iTunes COM object - iTunesApp - it works perfectly and allows me to control iTunes. This also works perfectly in a Console and WinForms app. But as soon as I switch it to use the IIS server, nothing seems to work. I need it to run as a website under ASP.NET so it can receive requests from other devices. This has tremendous potential for building a web app to control and essentially build a Web-based API around iTunes. It throws the following error on creation of a new instance of the iTunesApp class: 

    Retrieving the COM class factory for component with CLSID {DC0C2640-1415-4644-875C-6F4D769839BA} failed due to the following error: 80080005 Server execution failed (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80080005 (CO_E_SERVER_EXEC_FAILURE)).

First I was using the iTunes.Interop.dll file that is used in many of the projects around the web. I tried many times without luck and then tried registering the DLL, that threw an error about not finding an entry point into the DLL. So then I found that you have to give permission to the Application Pool Identity that the web app is running under to acces and execute the DCOM service in Windows Component Services. I did that, and also gave access to Everyone, still nothing. Then I tried using the COM library that is installed by iTunes (when you go to Add Reference, instead of browsing to the DLL file, I went under COM tab and selected iTunes Type Library), no luck. I suspect that when I gave permission to the Windows DCOM component, I gave permission to the installed iTunes COM library since Windows recognized that as installed (and I couldn't register the original iTunes.Interop.dll - Windows wouldn't know it was there).

Both, the installed iTunes Type Library and the iTunes.Interop.dll file, gave me the same aforementioned error. Strangely, the CLSID in the error (DC0C2640-1415-4644-875C-6F4D769839BA) doesn't match iTunes's ""Application ID"", as it is called in Component Services\DCOM\iTunes\Properties window, which is F98206B5-F052-4965-9FA0-85F61BC3C19D. My suspicion is that I'm not giving permission to the correct DCOM component in Windows. I searched my registry for the CLSID in the error and it returns no results, so I concluded that it's not the Application ID of any of the DCOM components (all the Application ID's are under Computer\HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Wow6432Node\AppID - didn't find it in there either). But since it's the CLSID in the error, it must be referenced to somewhere, I just couldn't find it anywhere. Searching for either ID on Google isn't helpful either because they both return search results that include iTunes, but none specific enough to the problem. 

I even tried the multithreaded approach. Since COM libraries run in STA model and web servers run in MTA, one of the solutions I found suggested to convert the server's thread execution model to STA and then call the COM library. This didn't work either. I have duplicated this problem on 2 computers running completely independent, and on both computers, the Visual Studio Development Server (and Console and WinForms applications)  can run it, but IIS cannot.

Here's the code I'm using (without the multithreading):

    using System;
    using System.Collections.Generic;
    using System.Linq;
    using System.Security.Principal;
    using System.Threading;
    using System.Web;
    using System.Web.UI;
    using System.Web.UI.WebControls;

                    }
            }
    }

The error is throw at the line: `var iTunes = new iTunesApp();`

If the multithreaded code would help, I can post that too. I'm pretty much directionless at this point and would appreciate any help in any capacity. Thanks.

If the multithreaded code would help, I can post that too. I'm pretty much directionless at this point and would appreciate any help in any capacity. Thanks.

P.S.: I've already looked around the internet and tried all the solutions I've mentioned above multiple times on multiple computers, so please keep that in mind when replying. Thanks.

328763,11/30/2008 11:32:24,32809,10/30/2008 15:55:20,13,1,How to take control of style sheets in ASP.NET Themes with the StylePlaceholder and Style control,"The problem is pretty simple. When using ASP.NET Themes you do not have much say in how your style sheets are rendered to the page.

The render engine adds all the style sheets you have in your themes folder in alphabetic order, using the <link href=”...”  notation.

We all know the order of the style sheets are important, luckily asp.nets shortcomings can be circumvented by prefixing the style sheets with 01, 02, ... , 99, and thus forcing the order you want.

This is especially important if you use a reset style sheet, which I highly recommend; it makes it much easier to style a site in a consistent form across browsers (take a look at [Reset Reloaded from Eric Meyer][1]).

You also miss out of the possibility to specify a media type (e.g. screen, print, projection, braille, speech). And if you prefer to include style sheets using the @import method, you are also left out in the cold.

Another missing option is Conditional Comment, which is especially useful if you use an “ie-fix.css” style sheet.

Before I explain how the StylePlaceholder and Style control resolve the above issues, credit where credit is due, my solution is inspired by [Per Zimmerman’s blog post][2] on the subject.

The StylePlaceholder control is placed in the header section of your master page or page. It can host one or more Style controls, and will remove styles added by the render engine by default, and add its own.

The Style control is a wrapper class; it can both host inline styles in-between it’s opening and closing tags and obviously refer to a style sheet file as well. Through properties you control how the style sheet it renders to the page.

Let me show an example. Consider a simple web site project with a master page and a theme with three style sheets – 01reset.css, 02style.css, 99iefix.cs. Note: I have named them using prefixing technique described earlier, as it makes for a better design time experience. Also, the tag prefix of the custom controls is “ass:”.

In the master page’s header section, add:

    <ass:StylePlaceholder ID=""StylePlaceholder"" runat=""server"" SkinID=""ThemeStyles"" />

In your theme directory, add a skin file (e.g. Styles.skin) and add the following content:

    <ass:StylePlaceholder runat=""server"" SkinId=""ThemeStyles"">
        <ass:Style Source=""~/App_Themes/Default/01reset.css"" />
        <ass:Style Source=""~/App_Themes/Default/02style.css"" />
        <ass:Style Source=""~/App_Themes/Default/99iefix.css"" Expression=""[if IE]"" />
    </ass:StylePlaceholder>

That is basically it. There are a more properties on the Style control that can be used to control the rendering, but this is the basic setup. With that in place, you can easily add another theme and replace all the styles, since you only need to include a different skin file.

Now to the code that makes it all happen. I must admit that the design time experience have some quirks. It is probably due to the fact that I am not very proficient in writing custom controls (in fact, these two are my first attempts), so I would very much like input on the following. In a current WCAB/WCSF based project I am developing, I am seeing errors like this in Visual Studios design view, and I have no idea why. The site compiles and everything works online.

So what do you guys think? Is this a good solution to the asp.net theme problem? And what about the code? I would really like some input on it, especially in regards to the design time experience.

Best regards, Egil.

When using ASP.NET Themes you do not have much say in how your style sheets are rendered to the page.

The render engine adds all the style sheets you have in your themes folder in alphabetic order, using the <link href=”...”  notation.

We all know the order of the style sheets are important, luckily asp.nets shortcomings can be circumvented by prefixing the style sheets with 01, 02, ... , 99, and thus forcing the order you want.

This is especially important if you use a reset style sheet, which I highly recommend; it makes it much easier to style a site in a consistent form across browsers (take a look at [Reset Reloaded from Eric Meyer][1]).

You also miss out of the possibility to specify a media type (e.g. screen, print, projection, braille, speech). And if you prefer to include style sheets using the @import method, you are also left out in the cold.

Another missing option is Conditional Comment, which is especially useful if you use an “ie-fix.css” style sheet.

Before I explain how the StylePlaceholder and Style control resolve the above issues, credit where credit is due, my solution is inspired by [Per Zimmerman’s blog post][2] on the subject.

The StylePlaceholder control is placed in the header section of your master page or page. It can host one or more Style controls, and will remove styles added by the render engine by default, and add its own.

The Style control is a wrapper class; it can both host inline styles in-between it’s opening and closing tags and obviously refer to a style sheet file as well. Through properties you control how the style sheet it renders to the page.

Let me show an example. Consider a simple web site project with a master page and a theme with three style sheets – 01reset.css, 02style.css, 99iefix.cs. Note: I have named them using prefixing technique described earlier, as it makes for a better design time experience. Also, the tag prefix of the custom controls is “ass:”.

In the master page’s header section, add:

    <ass:StylePlaceholder ID=""StylePlaceholder"" runat=""server"" SkinID=""ThemeStyles"" />

In your theme directory, add a skin file (e.g. Styles.skin) and add the following content:

    <ass:StylePlaceholder runat=""server"" SkinId=""ThemeStyles"">
        <ass:Style Source=""~/App_Themes/Default/01reset.css"" />
        <ass:Style Source=""~/App_Themes/Default/02style.css"" />
        <ass:Style Source=""~/App_Themes/Default/99iefix.css"" Expression=""[if IE]"" />
    </ass:StylePlaceholder>

That is basically it. There are a more properties on the Style control that can be used to control the rendering, but this is the basic setup. With that in place, you can easily add another theme and replace all the styles, since you only need to include a different skin file.

Now to the code that makes it all happen. I must admit that the design time experience have some quirks. It is probably due to the fact that I am not very proficient in writing custom controls (in fact, these two are my first attempts), so I would very much like input on the following. In a current WCAB/WCSF based project I am developing, I am seeing errors like this in Visual Studios design view, and I have no idea why. The site compiles and everything works online.

So what do you guys think? Is this a good solution to the asp.net theme problem? And what about the code? I would really like some input on it, especially in regards to the design time experience.

When I added a control statically in the .aspx page and followed their same procedure of loading the value in the page load and saving it on the button press I found that the value would not save correctly. It seems that it wouldn't save because the click event fires after the page_load, so the page_load of the post back reverted the value and the user entered value was not saved.

The strange thing is that by changing the control to be dynamically created just as all the other controls on the page and keeping the loading and saving the same it now works. Even though the page load still creates the control with the old database value.

 - Sharepoint 2010 Server Enterprise Edition
 - SQL Server 2008 R2
 - Office 2010 Professional

The app will need to a nice user interface with the normal Excel ribbon and interface completely hidden. Some web control(s) will cause the Excel chart(s) to be rendered.

I am thinking this sounds like Visual Studio Tools for Office (VSTO) so as to leverage .Net and hide Excel. 

Can you offer suggestions regarding:
One ASP.Net Web App Project
One Class Library Project for Excel

Would Excel Services for Sharepoint be useful (or required) ?

My takeaway there is that Response.Redirect() can be heavy-handed with ending threads.  And that can threaten my session writes if they occur too near that heavy-handedness.

**THE QUESTION:**

What about ASP.NET session management makes it so vulnerable to this?  The Response.Redirect() line of code doesn't begin its execution until the session write line is ""finished"" -- how can it be such a threat to my session write?

What about the session write doesn't ""finish"" before the next line of code executes?  Are there other scenarios in which session writes are similarly (as though they never occurred) lost?

I'm currently building my first umbraco website and since I'm completely new to umbraco I've already ran into a problem which I'm sure is pretty straight-forward to do.

That said, I'm by no means a beginner when it comes to building sites that run on a (open source) CMS as I've been using Joomla! since it was called Mambo.

Anyway, the site I'm building is here: [my site][1]

What I want to do is to have some content in the white box that changes when you mouseover/hover one of the menu items. Also that content has to stay ""active"" when you've clicked on a link (i.e. if you click on ""Profile"" I need to highlight the Profile menu item with the gray color and the white boxs content needs to be what would be related to the Profile menu item.

How do I go about this? What would be the best practice when it comes to showing multiple content on a site? I've watched the video about multiple Content Place Holders, but I never really got it to work. I can't get a page to display in the NavigationPlaceHolder (the placeholder I put in the white box), but thats because the actual page is Frontpage.aspx and not WhateverIsInThenavigationPlaceHolder.aspx. If I go to the mysite.dk/WhateverIsInTheNavigationPlaceHolder.aspx it shows up fine.

What have I missed here? :)

Thanks in advance! If my question is not clear in some ways, please tell me and I will try to explain it better.

All the best,

Using firebug I can see that the majority of this time in FireFox is spent on the server side. A total of 1.04 seconds.

Average Firefox Postback Time For 500 objects: 1.183 Second

Average IE Postback Time For 500 objects: 0.295 Seconds

Using firebug I can see that the majority of this time in FireFox is spent on the server side. A total of 1.04 seconds.

Given this fact the only thing I can assume is causing this problem is the way that ASP.Net renders its controls between the two browsers.

Has anyone run into this problem before?

Hi,

I have two servers, both with Windows Network Load Balancing installed and running on them.

I have an IP that all my domain points to, and that IP is then bound to both servers. NLB then does the clever stuff and figures out which server should handle the respective request.

Here's my problem:

Say I'm on server 1, browsing the site as usual, it's all working fine. I then take server 1 offline in the NLB window, so that server 2 is the only server running, and then click another link in the page. This is when server 2 seems to take about 2 minutes to respond.

I've checked my application trace and the page itself is taking less than a second to load. At first I thought it was taking time to initialize application pools in IIS etc, but we tested that by having someone constantly browse server 2 explicitly, and then I did the same test as before (Start on server 1, take that down and continue on server 2).

Also, i had a constant ping going on the I.P that manages the load balancing, and when I took one server down, I noticed pretty much no downtime in the return ping. So this makes me think it's something to do with the server loading, rather than NLB figuring out that the server is down.

Has anyone had this before? Am I missing anything blatently obvious?

Here's the setup:

 - Windows Server 2008 R2.
 - IIS 7.0 - each site is a .NET application running framework v.3.0.

Cheers, Sean

But not any for VB.NET 2010, can any of you kind people direct me to where I can find one or help me create one. What I want is when a user clicks on the date time picker he or she selects a date and it is entered within a text box and when a submit button is pressed it is saved within a SQL server 2008 database. Secondly I want to stop users for choosing the same time for example if i select 02/02/2012 3pm and another user has selected the same time on that day it should display a message of some sort saying time taken. I have been looking around and this is what I have found:

        public virtual Course Course { get; set; }
        public virtual Student Student { get; set; }
    }

How would I go about building a ViewModel that would let me edit the Attendance Table appropriately adjusting the number of days of attendance for the specified class depending on the AttendingDays int from the Course class.

i.e. If Class X has an AttendingDays value of 10, I need 10 rows of attendance dates that I can go down and fill a checkox for present/absent for each student - while Class Y only has 3 AttendingDays, etc. . .

So a sample row from the attendance table would read something like: ID 25: For Course X, Student X on day 3 was present.  ID26: For Course X, Student X on day 4 was absent, etc. . .

What is the most efficient way to approach this?",5

We recently deployed two WCF services that use our Spring managed service objects as dependencies.  We are using the `Spring.ServiceModel.Activation.ServiceHostFactory` to instantiate these services per the Spring.NET samples.  


Shortly after  deploying these services to production, we've experienced intermittent errors from the `AdoPlatformTransactionManager` class which manages Spring's transactions.

The error text is:

 - WCF object instancing/scope (PerCall) doesn't play well with singleton service objects
 - Some sort of concurrency issue in which multiple WCF service instances are able to interfere with the ambient transaction of other unrelated instances (thread local storage?)

Googling this error and searching the mostly deserted Spring.NET support forums had yielded nothing, so any help or ideas is appreciated!

It is the [3] column of the datagrid and always in the first row (since new rows are added at the top).

Is there a way to directly access this cell and temporarily 'hide' its contents, or mask them?  Ideally it would be great if there was a way to blank out all rows that had a value equal to this in their column, but a way to manipulate the specific cell would work as well.

How can I validate this text box to stop someone clicking on the buy button and therefore purchase items with the value of 0.00??

The issue is this: I have created an Interface that exposes 5 Events (to be used for a view in ASP.NET and the MVP Supervisory Controller pattern.....  I know, I should be using MVC, but that's a whole other issue).  Anyway, I want to test that when a certain event fires on the view, we'll call it ""IsLoaded"", that a method inside of my Presenter is called and, using Dependency Injection, a value is returned from the Dependency and set to the view.  Here is where the problem starts: when I use Expect.Call(Dependency.GetInfo()).Return(SomeList), the Call never executes (without the mock.ReplayAll() method being invoked).  Well, when I invoke the ReplayAll method, I get ExpectationExceptions because of the Subscription by the Presenter object to the other Events exposed by the View Interface.  

So, for me to test that IView.IsLoaded has fired, I want to verify that IView.ListOfSomething has been updated to match the list I passed in via the Expect.Call().  However, when I set the expectation, the other Event subscriptions (which occur straight out of the constructor for the Presenter) fail the #0 Expectations of the test.  What I get is, view.Save += this.SaveNewList tosses up a RhinoMocks ExpectationViolationException.

My million dollar question is this: Is it necessary I set expectations for ALL of my events (via [Setup]), or is there something that I'm missing/not understanding about how Unit Testing or RhinoMocks works?

Please bear in mind I am *extremely* new to Unit Testing, and therefore RhinoMocks.  If it appears I don't know what I'm talking about, please feel free to point that out.",asp.net,unit-testing,rhino-mocks,,,,open,0,298,3,"RhinoMocks Event Subscription Being new to RhinoMocks and Unit Testing, I have come accross an issue that I cannot seem to find a resolution to (no matter how much documentation I read).

I have a ASP.NET MVC solution with three projects:

 1. SquarkMVC
 2. SquarkBLL
 3. SquarkDAL

The SquarkDAL layer has Linq2SQL classes for each object in the DB. BLL references the DAL in order to conduct business logic on the DB.

My question is this... without having to reference the DAL in the MVC layer, how should I model the entities of the DB in the MVC layer? For instance, if I have a sign up form in the MVC layer, what is the best way to take that information, pass it to the Business Layer which then passes it on to the Data Layer? I don't want the MVC layer to know anything about the DAL. 

I've found [this answer on another post][1]... is it generally agreed that the best way to overcome this is to create a transfer object in order to pass the information from the presentation layer, to the business layer, which will then convert the information into the entity classes used by the DAL?


Hope this makes sense.

Lot of us, we work in companies where we face small-medium project sizes for other companies. We have to understand they business, they needs, plan an architecture, a model, etc.. etc.. 

Then, the customer says ""I need to support 1000 users"". Well, and how many requests per second is a user? how long are they sessions? how much data they transfer? which operations do they execute? how long are they?

Sometimes it is possible to know those figures (monitorizing their existing applications or because they have already that measurements done), sometimes it is not possible (because they do not have a current web site, or it is just to possible to know).

How do you make a guess about the number of servers, bandwidth, storage, etc... which figures of reference do you use?

I just read the book [The Art of Capacity planning][1] (BTW, I liked it), and in it the author explains how important is measuring your services, finding out your ceilings, forecasting your needs, ensure a easygoing deployment, etc.. etc.. But through the book he explains his experience in Flickr, where he has to face all the time the same product.

Lot of us, we work in companies where we face small-medium project sizes for other companies. We have to understand they business, they needs, plan an architecture, a model, etc.. etc.. 

Then, the customer says ""I need to support 1000 users"". Well, and how many requests per second is a user? how long are they sessions? how much data they transfer? which operations do they execute? how long are they?

Sometimes it is possible to know those figures (monitorizing their existing applications or because they have already that measurements done), sometimes it is not possible (because they do not have a current web site, or it is just to possible to know).
