After carefully read information on main page of [LAME][1], I find the Maate lib maybe more proper to my task and I also want to read the ""good description of MP3 frames"" from Maate as claimed by LAME.

  Unfortunately, I can't find Maate through the link provided by LAME. So what's going on? Is the project Maate still available? If yes, where can I find it? Any suggestion will be highly appriciated. Thank you all in advance.

Something new? 

Ideally, this question might push somebody to implement or take on one of these projects. If nothing else, this might serve as an interesting gauge of which projects developers are really interested in. ",1

The nature of the product is such that it will really need a number of developers to work for a sustained period of time to allow it to reach the ambitions I had when kicking off the project.

Now I have made some efforts into making the project ""developer-friendly"", such as:

- Good community: mailing list, IRC, friendliness
- Good developer documentation
- Very explicit and simply implemented code base

Still we have some difficuly in recruiting people. I know people use the project (it is in all the Linux distributions, and has had around 30K source downloads from google code, and a number of blog posts.)

I would like to ask the following question: is there anything on the Internet like an ""idea checkout"" system?

Situation: I'm a software developer. Since my current job has started 2 years ago, my mentor at that time has pointed me to the open source world. I have only put little time to look at some of the open source projects, let alone any contribution. However, it is my wish to start developing something outside of the work. Well, except a little problem.

I don't know what to develop!

It is not about the technical knowledge; the problem is that, I am not a creative person. I am very good at analytical thinking, as well as debugging skills. When being told by my work partners to develop a solution, I could get it done without a problem. However, outside of work, I have no idea what to develop. When I look at the Internet, it seems that so many people have already been developing on so many interesting stuff, making me wonder what I could develop, so that I would not reinvent something already existed.

That starts to make me wonder. On the Internet, is there anything like an ""idea checkout"" system or society? For example, some people would throw in as a software idea, and the system would keep it as an ""inventory""; later, a potential software developer would ""check out"" the idea, just a how people would check out a book from the library. Then, the developer would check the ""idea"" back in, with a certain kind of work-in-progress or developed software, thus becoming an open-source project.

I have just noticed that here at stackoverflow, there is a ""Project-Ideas"" tag, so perhaps that can provide me some ideas on what to develop; still, my wonder is about a system that people would provide ideas, and people would check out ideas to develop / implement into actual solution.

To me, that seems to say that, because my hosted version will be a work based on the covered work, I am required to license my version under the GPL as well.

Is there a way - under the standard GPL - to do what I want to do?  Certainly I could move to a different license, or even apply additional terms to the GPL, but my question is in regards to only the standard GPL.",3

It's about 10,000 lines of code now, so I'm far enough into the project that I now have better understanding of the problem at hand and have more and better ideas to take this project to the next level.

I'd like to however maintain the integrity of this project so it's more difficult for commercial companies to easily re-write the code and close source it (now that they've re-written their own code). When the code base is large enough, this sort of theft (in my opinion) is more difficult, so when the code base is large enough, commercial companies that like the project will instead choose to sponsor the development of more features into the project (either directly or by hiring others, I don't care) but eventually the project will grow for everyone and stay open for all users. 

This is why I'd like to hold on to the project a couple of more months until it has more structure into it. In a sense I'm delaying the release of the source now to protect the integrity of the project in the future.

What's encouraging me to do this is that I have enough financial resources to hire a couple of part time developers to help in areas where I'm less strong. This means that for the time being I can continue taking this project (internally as a closed source project) in the direction I intend and finish more of the features I have outlined for without needing community support or patches (which will be very low for the first year as I've noticed from most other open source I've released, only 2 can count as having had some bugs reported and an occasional patch in the first year). 

Now my intention is to open source the code eventually and GPL it. But for now, I'm convinced that delaying this step will protect the project from being absorbed into some kind of commercial closed source code and I won't be able to trace my code in it. Am I on the right track or can someone convince me otherwise.

To be frank i dont have any real world programming experience except some exercises and very small programs i wrote by myself.

At most a tetris game with the help of an article.

so i would really like to understand how other real world open source programmers made their goals and how to understand others programs in an easy way since many of the open source programs does not include proper documentation of how the program works.

I searched this forum and many others to find out how to start programming but many of them suggest to read the kernel code and even some compilers and all..

and i found in another thread that ""Less"" is a good option and tried that too but it seems complicated too for me.. 

Can anybody suggest me

      how to start and get in t the real world open source programming
      how to read others programs in the correct manner if they look complicated
      what are the skills needed to start other than the language knowledge
      how other programmers got in to mainstream programming..

I really would appreciate any reply and specially the replies coming from actual programmers with their examples.. 

Thanks a lot in advance..

The product itself (being vague here) is a business product that is designed to significantly reduce IT costs for certain types of business procedures for certain types of businesses.

My plan was to open-source the majority of the product and to charge for certain components or use-cases so that I could leverage viral marketing and allow users to try the majority of the features for free. As such, I've been researching freemium, where I give away the main product and I charge for certain features that would only appeal to customers of a certain size.

There are a few problems:

 * If I open-source the product, what is to stop others from adding in the features I have I plan to charge for as the value-add features? If others add-in the features that others might want to buy, then where does that leave me as the developer?
 * If I don't open-source the product, what chance to I have to actually get any kind of adoption?

The for-sale/closed-source features are relatively easy to replicate as these components themselves would have to be plug-ins. Much as I agree with open-source, and wish for the product to be open-source, I want a period of time where I can actually sell my product to larger organisations before I destroy my own business model.

Some questions:

* Is it possible to open-source a product but to restrict commercial usage via the license terms themselves (I wish to grant unrestricted commercial rights for particular use-cases but to restrict access to certain features)?
* Is there an example of a popular software library that is both open-source and freemium?
* If I open-source the product under restrictive terms, would it be illegal for another individual or organisation to fork off the open-source?


I really would like this product to benefit smaller organisations at little or no cost, but I require a business model that will allow me to charge for Enterprise features as I need a chance to recoup my investment.


Thanks.

P.S. As my reputation is less than 1,500 I can't tag this article with 'freemium' as it doesn't already exist. If someone has a hugh reputation, can they create the 'freemium' tag for me please. Thanks.
