I have 3 folders listed inside the manifest json, where 2 contain other folders and md files and just one contains only one md file. I was thinking that panda-docs would scan all the folders and subfolders automatically but it seems it doesn't and it is genereting only the html file corrisponding to the md file inside the folder that has not subfolders.

Do you have any ideas or examples to help me?

Does panda-docs just need the folders path to scan them and then it will go deep inside all subfolders taking the md files recursively?

This is my manifest json:

    {
	""files"": [ ""./index.md"", ""./overview"", ""./reference"", ""./tutorial""]
}

where overview and tutorial contain both md files and folders, and reference just contains one md file.

This is how I use the panda.make method:

`panda.make([manifestFile, ""--template"", ""./resources/nodejs_dev_guide/layout.jade"", ""--assets"", ""./resources/nodejs_dev_guide/skins"", ""-o"", outDir, ""--outputAssets"", ""./out/assets""], function(err) {

Here's what I came up with:

    fs = require('fs');

        res.end(fs.readFileSync(__dirname + '/public/' + req.url));

Clearly this would map `http://localhost:8080/index.html` to `project_dir/public/index.html`, and similarly so for all other files.

My one concern is that someone could abuse this to access files outside of `project_dir/public`.  Something like this, for example:

    http://localhost:8080/../../sensitive_file.txt

I tried this a little bit, and it wasn't working.  But, it seems like my browser was removing the "".."" itself.  Which leads me to believe that someone could abuse my poor little node.js server.

I know there are npm packages that do static file serving.  But I'm actually curious to write my own here.  So my questions are:

1.  Is this safe?

2.  If so, why?  If not, why not?

3.  And, if further, if not, what is the ""right"" way to do this?  My one constraint is I don't want to have to have an if clause for each possible file, I want the server to serve whatever files I throw in a directory.
