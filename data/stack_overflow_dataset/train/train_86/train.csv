The server should serve static content (videos, games, xml descriptions) after authenticating user credentials and charging the user. So a nosql db (couchdb or mongodb) will be used as well.

No need to produce dynamic content or html.

The pure speed is important but not the only parameter, also operational ease to use is important. 

From a development point of view I really like all 3 in their own way.

 1. All other things being equal Lift would be my first choice because of compatibility between Scala and Java.
 2. Second one is node.js because everybody understand Javascript.
 1. Erlang is a bit hard to learn and teach, so Yaws would be my last choice, although I personally like it.

So the question is: in your experience, what would you recommend me? Could be also another one.

Over the last three or four months, I've worked through a dozen books, dozens of online tutorials, and watched hundreds of screencasts teaching myself first Rails (along with html, css, etc), Node, JS and my favorite Coffeescript. I've built lots of toy programs at this point, and I'm really itching to get started on my first real project, ie. the startup idea I've had burning inside me that got me motivated to learn how to do this in the first place. I know at this point that I want to build with Node and Coffeescript. It would be easier, I think, to do it with Rails (due to the enormous amount of easy to access information), but Node just makes so much more sense, and it is definitely the direction everything seems to be moving in, and I think that its far more suited to the sort of very dynamic, user-involved application that I have in mind. Looking at the various frameworks out there, tower most definitely sits the best with me, and just really seems to be doing everything right. 

That said, I have a couple of questions (actually hundreds, but a couple for now). First, is anyone actually already using tower for production environment, real-world, mission critical development? The impression I get is that viatropos already is, but I wasn't 100% sure because of discussions being held in the ""issues"" tracker on github. 

Second, I've spent hours upon hours pouring over both the ""finalized"" documentation on the towerjs site as well as the wiki on github, and I still feel completely overwhelmed and unsure of where to get started. Tower seems to have so many moving pieces, and I think that really understanding how they all fit together can only come from actually using them, but being able to use them without understanding how they all fit together creates a chicken-and-egg dilemma that is quite frustrating. Tower has a lot of clear, well-written documentation, in fact a deal more than any of the other ""full-stack"" Node frameworks out there. But what is missing, at least for someone like me, is a clear starting point.  The perfect thing, in my opinion, would be a nice tutorial that walks someone through the building of the infamous Todos app (or far better, something more interesting), explaining each step as you go, so someone like me could take that as a starting-point for gaining a more gestalt-like comprehension of using the framework, and build something with limited but full-functionality, that I could then use to begin creating something with more functionality.

However, as far as I am aware, nothing like this currently exists (and I didn't really expect it to, with tower being such a young framework), so I'd like to ask instead for some advice on where to get started. Does anyone have a full, working example of a towerjs app that I could look at in all its glory, play with, and maybe rebuild piece-by-piece to try to understand it, or else perhaps a list of steps to get me moving forward with learning it through trial-and-error? Or an other reccomendations at all?

Well, since many days I've been looking for an answer to this question but there seems to be answers for 'How to create a Push Notification Server' and like questions. I am using node.js and it's quite easy to 'create' a push notification server using sock.js (I've heard socket.io isn't good as compared to sock.js). No problem till here. But what I want is how to *model* such a server.

**Details**:

OK, so, let's say I've an application where there's a chat service (just an example this is, actual thing is big as you might have guessed). A person sends a message in a room and all the people in the room get notified. But what I want is a 'stateful' chat - that is, I want to store the messages in a data store. Here's where the trouble comes. Storing the message in the database and later telling everyone that ""Hey, there's a message for you"". This seems easy when we need the *real-time activity* for just one part of the app. What to do when the whole app is based on real-time communication? Besides this, I also want to have a RESTful api.

**My solution (with which I am not really happy)**

What I thought of doing was this: (on the server side of course)

                     Data Store<br>
                         ||

Node version is v0.6.15 and npm 1.1.16. I have goog about this but with no answer to resolve. Could someone help me?

The code is simple test:

        scripts: ['http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.2/jquery.min.js'],

            console.log(title);
            }
    });

        scripts: ['http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.2/jquery.min.js'],
        done: function(errors, window){
            var $ = window.$;
            var title = $('title').text();
            console.log(title);
            }

Think of a whatzapp application which you might already know if you use an android/iphone app.

I am very confused about what architecture we should design. 

My concerns:
1) We need to have ACK packets so that users could be ensure their messages are delivered or not.

2) We would have great scaling issues since we are thinking to have up to 1 M users since we don't have big sources to fund our servers, we might think to use node.js as it can handle more concurrent users in just one server.(with using node.io framework for node.js maybe, however they dont have multiple server support yet). And we would save the chat history in nosql database.


But at the end, i came up with using messaging queue applications like rabbitmq, amqp, zeromq.

I am really stucked and don't know if we should use such messaging queue applications. 

So my question is using node.js with or without messaging queue applications is a correct idea. What are your recommendations? 

And another concern is,

We should save the ""message"" to our database, and send it to receiver ? Or we should send the message direclty to receiver and save it to database. Considering tons of people chatting each other, it might be best way to send the message first and save it to the database; this way we could decrease latency and get rid of time that passes while writing the message to db.

Would be happy to hear back your opinions.",node.js,nosql,chat,rabbitmq,livechat,12/27/2011 23:15:16,not a real question,1,312,9,"What is best architecture for running a chat application We are building a web based chat application. (will be using sencha/phonegap alike frameworks to make our app run in android/iphone devices).

Think of a whatzapp application which you might already know if you use an android/iphone app.

I am very confused about what architecture we should design. 

My concerns:
1) We need to have ACK packets so that users could be ensure their messages are delivered or not.

2) We would have great scaling issues since we are thinking to have up to 1 M users since we don't have big sources to fund our servers, we might think to use node.js as it can handle more concurrent users in just one server.(with using node.io framework for node.js maybe, however they dont have multiple server support yet). And we would save the chat history in nosql database.


But at the end, i came up with using messaging queue applications like rabbitmq, amqp, zeromq.

I am really stucked and don't know if we should use such messaging queue applications. 

So my question is using node.js with or without messaging queue applications is a correct idea. What are your recommendations? 

And another concern is,

We should save the ""message"" to our database, and send it to receiver ? Or we should send the message direclty to receiver and save it to database. Considering tons of people chatting each other, it might be best way to send the message first and save it to the database; this way we could decrease latency and get rid of time that passes while writing the message to db.

- I am not reaching max sockets/host (agent.maxSockets) limit: all urls are from unique hosts.
- I am not reaching max file descriptors limit (AFAIK): my ulimit -n is 2560, and lsof shows that my scraper never uses more than 20 file descriptors.

Is there any limit I don't know about? I am on Mac OS-X.",3

I've added unique indexes to username/email and checked if it works - and I can not add a duplicated entry using mongo's console or rockmongo (php mongodb manager) - so it works fine.

However - when the piece of code that is supposed to register a new account is being executed and makes an insert with the data that is already in database - it returns an object that contains all the data that was supposed to be added with a new, unique id. The point is - it should return an error that would say that entries can not be duplicated and insert failed - instead it returns the data back and gives it a new id. Data that already resides in database remains untouched - even the ID stays the same - it's not rewritten with the new one returned by script's insert.

So, the question is... what am I doing wrong? Or maybe everything is fine and database's insert should return data even if it's failed?...

I even tried defining indexes before executing indexes.
I tried inserting the data using mongoDB's default functions and [mongoJS][1] functions - the result is the same in both cases.

I've tried RESTify but it doesn't have session manager or build-in database (MongoDB) validation like Railsway.

There is no need for templates because I'll be using BackboneJS to render templates on the client side.

Will Express with it's Connect middleware do the trick?

As an example (this is not the real thing) you could think about this set up as one server managing user authentication, another one serving as the game engine, another one as a pubsub server. Logically the ""application"" is only one and clients connect to one or another server depending on their specific need.

Now I'm trying to figure out the best way to run a setup like this in a production environment.

The simplest way could be to have a bash script that would run each server in background one after the other. One problem with this approach would be that in the case I need to restart the ""application"", I should have saved each server's pid and kill each one.

Another way would be to use a node process that would run each servers as its own child (using child_process.spawn). Node spawning nodes. Is that stupid for some reason? This way I'd have a single process to kill when I need to stop/restart the whole application.

What do you think?

btw proxychains is inadequate for this task as it seems to put requests in queue instead of opening many connections at a time
I could use socks for my task but tsocks seems to not work at all

some other posts suggested that a get over http would work
