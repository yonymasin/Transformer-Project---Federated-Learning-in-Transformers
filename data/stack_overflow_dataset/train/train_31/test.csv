11121175,06/20/2012 13:53:26,1469365,06/20/2012 13:18:20,1,0,SOLVED: Groupon offer on Magento site with Paypal Website Payments Pro Hosted - Subtotal zero -Rejected,"I'm sharing this after spending days trying to find a solution online but couldn't find anything. Hopefully my solution may help others struggling with the same problem and my apologise in advance if this has already been covered elsewhere but I (and therefore probably others) couldn't find it.


A client is running a Groupon promotion on the site that I manage which runs Magento 1.7. All payments go through Papal Website Payments Pro hosted which was rejecting the Groupon coupon orders.

The Groupon coupon code discounts the product value by 100% and there is only a shipping charge remaining. This is sent to Paypal and is rejected with the message ""Subtotal amount is not valid."" because the subtotal is zero even though shipping and tax have a value.

Here's the log file:

            [L_BUTTONVAR0] => subtotal=0.00
            [L_BUTTONVAR1] => tax=2.50
            [L_BUTTONVAR2] => shipping=12.50

The very simple solution that took me days to find was to edit this file:

    /app/code/core/Mage/Paypal/Model/Hostedpro/Request.php

Replace this (it's near the bottom):

    protected function _getOrderData(Mage_Sales_Model_Order $order)
    {
        $request = array(
            'subtotal'      => $this->_formatPrice(
                $this->_formatPrice($order->getPayment()->getBaseAmountAuthorized()) -
                $this->_formatPrice($order->getBaseTaxAmount()) -
                $this->_formatPrice($order->getBaseShippingAmount())
            ),
            'tax'           => $this->_formatPrice($order->getBaseTaxAmount()),
            'shipping'      => $this->_formatPrice($order->getBaseShippingAmount()),
            'invoice'       => $order->getIncrementId(),
            'address_override' => 'false',
            'currency_code'    => $order->getBaseCurrencyCode(),
            'buyer_email'      => $order->getCustomerEmail()
        );

with this:

    protected function _getOrderData(Mage_Sales_Model_Order $order)
    {
        $request = array(
            'subtotal'      => $this->_formatPrice(
                $this->_formatPrice($order->getPayment()->getBaseAmountAuthorized())

            'buyer_email'      => $order->getCustomerEmail()
        );


This sends Paypal the total amount in the subtotal field so that it doesn't reject the order.

I would be really interested in any feedback from other people around this.

In Magento v1.6 I use configurable products with associated simple products

example configurable: 1234-CSS  (where 1234 is a design like ""flowers"", CSS is a style of shirt CrewShortSleeve )

associated simple:
1234-CSS-XL (where XL is size attribute - extra large)

Magento tracks stock of all my associated simple products - however - my ""real"" stock is not 1234-CSS-XL, nor is it the configurable product 1234-CSS, it is actually CSS-XL. remember, I buy blank white shirts and print designs on them. 

I have a manual way to track my stock via exports and imports to stock. I create what I call a ""sister product for inventory"" , for example, CSS-XL. 
i export all the items ordered, then in spreadsheet I aggregate the associated simple products according to the ""real"" stock, and subract that from the sister product stock.
(then zero out the simple product stock that was purchased so I can easily do it again later)

thus when someone buys a 1234-CSS-XL and 5678-CSS-XL ,  this means that the sister product, CSS-XL, should have 2 deducted from its stock. 

**is there anyway to do this automatically in magento?** 

like, can I bundle the associated simple product with a ""sister"", but hide that sister one and make sure it doesn't show to the customer? 

or, is there some sort of multiple parents setup where the associated simple products that are purchased can deduct from another parent - (my sister product) ? 

or, can I make the associated simple product have an attribute that can be tracked in stock?

am I missing something obvious in Magento? should I arrange my products differently? 

I have used volusion, and there they just have a product attribute called ""SharesStockStatusWith"" which very easily accomplishes my goal. 

thanks all.
