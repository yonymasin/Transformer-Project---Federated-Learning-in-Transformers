Eg.

16.25 is 12% of $129.99 so the tax figure is correct. However it should be displaying as follows:

First of all, that error should never feature at this point, as the Validation on the one page checkout does not allow you to register with an email address that already exists, and also wont let you go any further to the payment method tab, which is hidden by Ajax in our solution, if you did not enter an email address.

We have two clients for our Magento site who both have their internal networks setup using bluecoat security devices and F5 load balancers. Some users within these networks are unable to login to Magento - Magento eventually is sending a 302 redirect to /index.php/ when users attempt to log in.

Through our testing, the problem appears to be isolated to this setup - we can log into the accounts in question from anywhere outside of these networks without issue, and if the client tries to access the site without going through the F5 load balancer, they are able to log in successfully.

Strangely enough, the issue only started occurring for the two sites the day after we introduced a system upgrade which added a new site to the Magento installation. The system upgrade should not have affected any standard login functionality, and as said, the problem does not appear to be with the users in question, but with where the users are accessing the site from.

Initially we thought the issue might have something to do with communications between the client's networks and the network which the server was hosted on, so we've tried moving the server to different hosts, but this has not helped.

I'm currently waiting for more info from the clients on exact devices / models used in their network setup. I will update this post if more information becomes avaliable.

Magento version is enterprise edition of ver. 1.9.0.0

Does anyone know of any tucked away Magento settings that might be able to cause this kind of behavior? Experience with this kind of set-up and ideas for things to look at?

All help and ideas for things to follow-up would be appreciated - as this is a current production issue for a large number of users. I will respond asap with any requests for additional information on the topic, but currently am not able to disclose any identifying information on the project in question, and/or the clients experiencing issues.

Currently I am storing the sessions in files. I do have some concerns that by having them in files I am slowing down operations like adding to cart since it has to write to a file every time someone adds a product to cart (I am getting reports from some of my customers that the more products they add to cart, the slower the entire checkout process becomes).

I currently have a separate Web and Database server. The specs for them are as follows:

    Web Server
    12GB Ram
    2 X Intel Xeon Quad Core @ 2.00GHz

    Database Server
    16GB Ram

Does anyone have any advice? Do you think switching to session storage in the database is a better idea? I constantly have around 75-100 people browsing the site so I do not want to go back and forth killing off their sessions to benchmark.

Does any one know how I can continue the installation?",magento,,,,,03/08/2012 07:59:05,off topic,1,99,3,"Installing Magento localy I am trying to install Magento localy on my computer.

First i had a problem when the installer was giving me ""Illegal scheme supplied, only alphanumeric characters are permitted"". I managed to solve the issue with the help of [this blog][1].


I managed to continue the installation and I am stuck again. I am looping in the ""Download"" section, but all files seem to be installed with no problem. When i hit ""Continue Magento installation"" button its the download page again and again.

If you're on the review page, it doesn't show the short description (it is set to null in the block's class file). Also, product options are also not shown, just a generic 'Add to cart' button... which does nothing but redirect you back to the product page so you can choose the product's options.

Can i create **multiple web store** with **single admin and database** **in Magento**. i want to host these stores from different servers. In other words my database and code (different code for different site) would be on different servers.

**for ex:** i have **abc.com** and **xyz.com** stores created in Magento hosted on different servers but the database is same.

i have already created **multi-store concept** in Magento with **Magento's default functionality** but in that case we can't host different website from different server because there is a single code for both of the site or store 

why i wanted to use this concept just because of security purpose and in case of server crash there will be no harm to other web store because they are hosted from different servers
