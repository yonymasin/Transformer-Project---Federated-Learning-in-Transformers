Are there limitations on what language I could use to develop this?

I know there are already several solution out there but this is just going to be proof of the concept, nothing more. The idea would be to make the application main application almost featureless by default and then let the plugins know about each other, having them have implement all the needed features.

A couple of issues arise:

1. I want the plugins at runtime to know about each other through my application. That wouldn't mean that at code-time they couldn't reference other plugin's assemblies so they could use its interfaces, only that plugin-feature initialization should be always through my main app. For example: if I have both plugins X and Y loaded and Y wants to use X's features, it should ""register"" its interest though my application to use its features. I'd have to have a kind of ""dictionary"" in my application where I store all the loaded plugins. After registering for interest in my application, plugin Y would get a reference to X so it could use it. Is this a good approach?
2. When coding plugin Y that uses X, I'd need to reference X's assembly, so I can program against its interface. That has the issue of versioning. What if I code my plugin Y against an outdated version of plugin X? Should I always use a ""central"" place where all assemblies are, having there always the up to date versions of the assemblies?

Are there by chance any books out there that specifically deal with these kinds of designs for .NET?

One thing about OPF3 I like in my evaluation so far is that it is very easy to customize. Since it binds database fields to object members using attributes, you do not *need* to use any code generation tool. This also means you can basically create your own classes, and then add OPF3 data binding on top of that.

        <Field(""name"", allowDbnull:=False)> _
        Public Property Name() As String
    End Class


They do have a generation tool, and one thing I don't like is that the demo will not output classes, so I can't actually see what it is *really* going to do.  On the plus side again, it appears that when you buy the tool, you get the source for it as well.

2nd we need to create a domain service using earlier create data model as data context.

I guess it is clear that it will be not a very good idea to start EF usage as data context in my case: this approach will require to work with the DB data directly skipping DAL and BLL logic.

1. What is a better way to get SilverLight functionality on my web-site: to use RIA servicec or better to skip RIA services, implement own WebService that will provide the data, use this WS from the SilverLight app directly)?

I've created a databindable class called `Folder` which implements a `ITreeItem` interface and inherits from `BindingList<ITreeItem>`.  I have a second class, `TreeLeaf`, which is a leaf in the tree, a terminus that can't contain more child items.

The intent is to be able to databind to a `Folder` and have databinding walk the tree of folders (and n-level subfolders) and leafs.  The databinding, however, doesn't descend into the underlying BindingList of a `Folder`, and as a result the `Folder` is appearing to not have child items when databound.

So far it looks like databinding is working with the folder as an instace of `ITreeItem`, which is correct, and not realizing that the `Folder` is anything other than an instance of `ITreeItem`.

**My question is**: how can I either expose to databinding that a folder is *both* an implementation of `ITreeItem` and also a descendant of `BindingList<ITreeItem`; or how can I hook into the databinding to help it walk down the structure?

_I've a set of WCF REST services and an ASP.NET client application._

_Everything about business, data, process and validation occurs in the services' infrastructure._

_ASP.NET client application is a consumer of these WCF REST services._

_In the near future, these WCF REST services will be consumed by mobile applications (Android, iOS and Windows Phone)._

**Problem**

Optimal way of implementing authentication.

**Possible approaches**

* _Token authentication_. First successful login generates an authentication token, which is transmitted over the wire back to the client. Next requests will send the authentication token stored in a cookie, because service layer maintains an authentication token store. Tokens will expire in an arbitrary time.

* _Session-state authentication store_. First successful login marks a session in some session state store as an authenticated session. Since Web client stores its session identifier in a cookie, next requests will transport it and service layer checks if session for given identifier is authenticated. Sessions will expire in an arbitrary time.

**Question**

In my case, I would go for first option: **token authentication**.

Anyway, I'm worried about security issues, because if someone steals token or session identifier, this may be able to supplant owner's identity.

Summary: **what would be your choice?**. I'll appreciate that you talk about security concerns.

I am the author of IronScheme. Recently I have been working hard on emitting decent debug info, so that I can use the 'native' .NET debugger. 

While this has been partly successful, I am running into some teething problems.

The first problem is related to stepping.

Due to Scheme being an expression language, everything tends to be wrapped in parenthesis, unlike the major .NET languages which seems to be statement (or line) based.

The original code (Scheme) looks like:

    (define (baz x)
      (cond
        [(null? x) 
          x]
        [(pair? x) 
          (car x)]
        [else
          (assertion-violation #f ""nooo"" x)]))

I have on purpose laid out each expression on a newline.

The emitted code transforms to C# (via ILSpy) looks like:

    public static object ::baz(object x)
    {
      if (x == null)
      {
        return x;
      }
      if (x is Cons)
      {
        return Builtins.Car(x);
      }
      return #.ironscheme.exceptions::assertion-violation+(
         RuntimeHelpers.False, ""nooo"", Builtins.List(x));
    }

As you can see, pretty simple. 

Note: If the code was transformed into a conditional expression (?:) in C#, the whole thing would just be one debug step, keep that in mind.

Here is IL output with source and line numbers:

*Note:* To prevent the debugger from simply highlighting the entire method, I make the method entry point just 1 column wide.

As you can see, each expression maps correctly to a line.

Now the problem with stepping (tested on VS2010, but same/similar issue on VS2008):

These are with `IgnoreSymbolStoreSequencePoints` not applied.

1. Call baz with null arg, it works correctly. (null? x) followed by x.
2. Call baz with Cons arg, it works correctly. (null? x) then (pair? x) then (car x).
3. Call baz with other arg, it fails. (null? x) then (pair? x) then (car x) then (assertion-violation ...).

When applying `IgnoreSymbolStoreSequencePoints` (as recommended):

1. Call baz with null arg, it works correctly. (null? x) followed by x.
2. Call baz with Cons arg, it fails. (null? x) then (pair? x).
3. Call baz with other arg, it fails. (null? x) then (pair? x) then (car x) then (assertion-violation ...).

I also find in this mode that some lines (not shown here) are incorrectly highlighted, they are off by 1.

Here are some ideas what could be the causes:

- Tailcalls confuses the debugger
- Overlapping locations (not shown here) confuses the debugger (it does so very well when setting a breakpoint)
- ????

The second, but also serious, issue is the debugger failing to break/hit breakpoints in some cases.

The only place where I can get the debugger to break correctly (and consistantly), is at the method entry point. 

The situation gets a bit better when `IgnoreSymbolStoreSequencePoints` is not applied.


**Conclusion**

It might be that the VS debugger is just plain buggy  :(

=====

Hi,

I’m developing a private desktop application that accesses orders and fulfillment information
This is so the warehouse people can get automated reports every so often without them interacting with a  web browser.

We tried using basic auth but it seems to work only for user-agent access.
Whenever we use it from a desktop application, it doesn’t let us access any data at all.

Hi,

I’m developing a private desktop application that accesses orders and fulfillment information
This is so the warehouse people can get automated reports every so often without them interacting with a  web browser.

We tried using basic auth but it seems to work only for user-agent access.
Whenever we use it from a desktop application, it doesn’t let us access any data at all.

 - Every entity which should be localized is split into 2 table and 2 entities. For example, I have an entity Service which holds some information, and another entity ServiceLocale which holds localized properties, such as Name, description etc. Same goes for tables.

 - Service has a protected field which holds a list of ServiceLocales. ServiceLocale has a property Culture which specifies which language the object belongs.

 - how do i read from hidden partition through .net?

   *(i did never confront with this till now...)*
 - how i make hidden partition through .net?

When both are true, I want 6,6,6,6.

I've described my first two attempts below. I haven't given up yet, but I wanted to see if anyone else might have any ideas.

**Attempt #1**

I got it partially working by binding to the MyViewModel instance itself (not a specific property) and using an IValueConverter that builds the correct CornerRadius object. This works on initial load. The problem is that the binding is monitoring changes of the object as a whole rather than changes to the specific RoundLeft and RoundRight properties, e.g. if RoundLeft changes, the border's CornerRadius doesn't.

Winform:

	Application.EnableVisualStyles();
	Application.SetCompatibleTextRenderingDefault(false);
	MainForm form = new MainForm();
	Application.Run(form);

WPF pre-init:

	application = new System.Windows.Application
	{
		ShutdownMode = System.Windows.ShutdownMode.OnExplicitShutdown
	};

Calling the WPF form:

	ConfirmForm form = new ConfirmForm();
	application.Run(form);

What is going on here?:

On 32bit platforms it's best to use Int32 as opposed to short or long due to to the cpu processing 32 bits at a time. So on a 64 bit architecture does this mean it's faster to use longs for performance? I created a quick and dirty app that copies int and long arrays to test the benchmarks. Here is the code(I did warn it's dirty):

1. Compatibility with Sql Server 2008 R2 & 2012.
 - This is very important as we simply don't have the resources to debug poor support of existing MS technology stack.
 - Also planning ahead since 2012 is pretty much out and plans to migrate to it are in place.
2. Support for .NET 4.0 and 4.5 (upcoming)
 - Again very important for pretty much the same reason above.
3. Transaction handling and table hints eg. forcescan forceseek, read uncomitted.
 - A lot of times the query optimizer does its job well, other times I want the flexibility to tell it what to do.
4. Support for conversation, self tracking attach & detach
 - This is somewhat fundamental. I hate to keep the session open for prolonged period. Especially in distributed computing/web farm environment.
5. Ability to handle code first development, create and update schema without destroying data.
 - EF 4.1 seems to be wanting in this regard, although 4.3 is leap and bound better. Also liking the data annotation better than seperate mapping classes in NH. Reason being I want to be able to send in the class and from there be able to create persistence model without widening the method for the mapping classes.
6. Support for IRepository pattern
7. Support for LINQ
  - Somewhat tied to (6) above I want really good support for linq. I don't want developers to muck around with lower level implementation and getting ourselves stuck to one particular ORM
8. Performance
9. Support for bulk CRUD operations, without having to load the data into the application layer. Eg. I want to increment all rows in a column of a particular table by 1. I don't want to load this up to memory, and increment the rows one by one. This would be crazy for such a simple operation. Linq2Sql used to have Magiq to handle this sort of thing, what does NH and EF have?
10. Caching, eager loading, lazy loading, navigation properties.
  - Let me be frank I hate these things when done implicitly. Reason being it's hard to distinguish what is cached, stale from what is new. In EF I usually drop all navigation properties, because I don't want these properties loaded with top 5, because that's what the current operation needs, but further down the stream another developer attempts to do a count which will be inaccurate.

1. Compatibility with Sql Server 2008 R2 & 2012.
 - This is very important as we simply don't have the resources to debug poor support of existing MS technology stack.
 - Also planning ahead since 2012 is pretty much out and plans to migrate to it are in place.
2. Support for .NET 4.0 and 4.5 (upcoming)
 - Again very important for pretty much the same reason above.
3. Transaction handling and table hints eg. forcescan forceseek, read uncomitted.
 - A lot of times the query optimizer does its job well, other times I want the flexibility to tell it what to do.
4. Support for conversation, self tracking attach & detach
 - This is somewhat fundamental. I hate to keep the session open for prolonged period. Especially in distributed computing/web farm environment.
5. Ability to handle code first development, create and update schema without destroying data.
 - EF 4.1 seems to be wanting in this regard, although 4.3 is leap and bound better. Also liking the data annotation better than seperate mapping classes in NH. Reason being I want to be able to send in the class and from there be able to create persistence model without widening the method for the mapping classes.
6. Support for IRepository pattern
7. Support for LINQ
  - Somewhat tied to (6) above I want really good support for linq. I don't want developers to muck around with lower level implementation and getting ourselves stuck to one particular ORM
8. Performance
9. Support for bulk CRUD operations, without having to load the data into the application layer. Eg. I want to increment all rows in a column of a particular table by 1. I don't want to load this up to memory, and increment the rows one by one. This would be crazy for such a simple operation. Linq2Sql used to have Magiq to handle this sort of thing, what does NH and EF have?
10. Caching, eager loading, lazy loading, navigation properties.
  - Let me be frank I hate these things when done implicitly. Reason being it's hard to distinguish what is cached, stale from what is new. In EF I usually drop all navigation properties, because I don't want these properties loaded with top 5, because that's what the current operation needs, but further down the stream another developer attempts to do a count which will be inaccurate.
  - So my personal policy all SOA shall be stateless unless there is a good reason otherwise. If you need referencing data, get it from persistence. It will be slower but the code will be more readable and flexible.

My question relates to accessing a UI object, in the background in WPF. I have seen dozens of sample apps, that all are simple, easy to follow, and 95% of which tell you how display a progress bar. That’s not quite what I want….. 

My problem is this: I want to perform a long task (or many long tasks) by accessing a FlowDocument in a RichTextBox. The exact task isn’t relevant here, but an example might be to scan through the document, and count the number of times a particular word appears, or how many red characters there are……. In a long document, those could be fairly time consuming tasks, and if done in the foreground, would tie up the UI considerably and make it unresponsive.  I only want to parse the FlowDocument; I do not want to make any changes to it.
 
So that’s the kind of thing I’m trying to do. The obvious solution is to do it in the background, but the question is…how? I have achieved what *appears* to be an answer, but it just doesn’t “feel right” to me, which is why I am here asking for help.

**My “Solution”**

My “solution” which follows uses a BackgroundWorker which calls the UI object’s Dispatcher to ensure the right thread is accessed…and it “appears” to do the job. But does it?..............
 I have considerably abbreviated my “solution” to make it easy (I hope) to follow what I am doing….

    WithEvents worker As BackgroundWorker
    Private Delegate Sub DelegateSub()
    Private theDocument As FlowDocument
    
    ''' <summary>
    ''' Triggers the background task. Can call from anywhere in main code blocks
    ''' </summary>
    Private Sub StartTheBackgroundTask()
    
        worker = New BackgroundWorker
        worker.RunWorkerAsync()
    
    End Sub
    
    ''' <summary>
    ''' In the background, hands the job over to the UI object's Dispatcher
    ''' </summary>
    Private Sub HandleWorkerDoWork(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As DoWorkEventArgs) Handles worker.DoWork
    
        Dim priority As System.Windows.Threading.DispatcherPriority
        Dim theLongRunningTask As DelegateSub
    
        '(1) Define a delegate for the Dispatcher to work with
        theLongRunningTask = New DelegateSub(AddressOf DoTheTimeConsumingTask)
    
        '(2) Set Dispatcher priority as required
        priority = System.Windows.Threading.DispatcherPriority.Background
    
        '(3) Add the job to the FlowDocument's Dispatcher's tasks
        theDocument.Dispatcher.BeginInvoke(theLongRunningTask, priority)
    
    End Sub
    
    ''' <summary>
    ''' Sub whose logic accesses, but does not change, the UI object
    '''  </summary>
    Private Sub DoTheTimeConsumingTask()
    
        'For example......
    
        For Each bl As Block In theDocument.Blocks
    
            '......do something
    
        Next
    
    End Sub

Although that seems to work, the problem as I see it is that apart from triggering the task with the BackgroundWorker, pretty much ALL the long running task is handled by the UI object’s Dispatcher. So the BackgroundWorker doesn’t actually do any work. That’s the part that concerns me; I can’t see how I am gaining anything, if the Dispatcher is tied up doing all the work

**Option 2**

So, it seemed more logical to me that I would be better to “twist this around a little” and set the Dispatcher’s delegate to point to the sub that instantiates and starts the BackGroundWorker (my thinking being that the Dispatcher thread would then own the BackgroundWorker’s thread), and to do all the work in the BackgroundWorker’s DoWork event.  That “felt” right….

So I tried this, instead :

    WithEvents worker As BackgroundWorker
    Private Delegate Sub DelegateSub()
    Private theDocument As FlowDocument
    
    ''' <summary>
    ''' Triggers the background task. Can call from anywhere in main code blocks
    ''' </summary>
    Private Sub StartTheBackgroundTask()
    
        Dim priority As System.Windows.Threading.DispatcherPriority
        Dim theTask As DelegateSub
    
        '(1) Define a delegate for the Dispatcher to work with
        theTask = New DelegateSub(AddressOf RunWorker)
    
        '(2) Set Dispatcher priority as required
        priority = System.Windows.Threading.DispatcherPriority.Normal
    
        '(3) Add the job to the Dispatcher's tasks
        theDocument.Dispatcher.BeginInvoke(theTask, priority)
    
    End Sub
    
    ''' <summary>
    ''' Creates and starts a new BackGroundWorker object
    ''' </summary>
    Private Sub RunWorker()
    
        Worker = New BackgroundWorker
        Worker.RunWorkerAsync()
    
    End Sub
    
    ''' <summary>
    ''' Does the long task in the DoWork event
    ''' </summary>
    Private Sub HandleWorkerDoWork(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As DoWorkEventArgs) Handles worker.DoWork
    
        DoTheTimeConsumingTask()
    
    End Sub
    
    ''' <summary>
    ''' Sub whose logic accesses, but does not change, the UI object
    '''  </summary>
    Private Sub DoTheTimeConsumingTask()
    
        'For example......
    
        For Each bl As Block In theDocument.Blocks
    
            '......do something
    
        Next
    
    End Sub

To me, that all seemed far more logical. I surmised the Dispatcher would own the BackgroundWorker, which in turn would do all the long work, and everything would be on the UI thread. Well….so much for logical thinking…(usually fatal with WPF!)....It doesn’t. It crashes with the usual “Different Thread” error. So, what seemed on second thoughts to be a far more elegant solution, turned out to be a loser!

My questions then are as follows:

    1. Is my “solution” a solution, or not?
    2. Where am I going wrong?
    3. How can the “solution” be improved so that the Dispatcher is not tied up with the long task ….which is exactly the situation I was trying to avoid? 

A further question. Please note that I had to use the FlowDocument’s Dispatcher to make this work. If I used the System.Windows.Threading.Dispatcher.CurrentDispatcher instead, then the Delegate sub (DoTheTimeConsumingTask ) does not get invoked so – to all intents and purposes – nothing happens. Can someone explain why not, please? 


I have not come to you as a first port of call. I’ve tried dozens of options, and haven’t found anything yet that feels totally right (apart from my second option that doesn’t work LOL) so I’m asking for some guidance, please.

What is best practice?,"I have a class which models online campaigns i.e. people clicking through to the site from affiliate websites, and we need to record all these clicks and any purchases that are made. This class has the usual crap - name, start date, end date etc. - which we need to return and I have a constructor which populates these values. All very standard and all very fine. I've done all the standard GetAll and GetById functions which use that constructor to populate the object. 

However, in one case I need to return a list of the campaigns with their totals e.g. total clicks, total purchases etc. These clicks  / purchases are stored in a separate DB table and the totals will be calculated using an SQL aggragate function. I could call a function which would get the total clicks and then another to get the total purchases for each campaign as we loop through them, but that would mean two extra database calls for each campaign returned. 

Another option would be to always return the totals when you search for a campaign, but this is putting unnecessary work on the DB as the clicks table could get quite large quite quickly and doing aggregate functions on that wouldn't be a good idea. 

I finally thought of declaring public properties totalClicks and totalPurchases which aren't populated in the constructor, but only when you call the specific GetTheTotals function. This is grand, but it means that when you are accessing an instance of the campaign object you could try objCampaign.totalClicks even though it is probably not set.

- [elasticsearch][2]
- [RavenDB][3]

elasticsearch positions itself as primarily serving advanced search scenarios while RavenDB positions itself as a document-oriented-database.

Primarily, the document will be around videos.  Each has a natural id.  That will be the key of the document.

Around that, I add other content in fields which will not necessarily be scalar or flat, as the information will come from a number of different sources with different structures.

For example, there will be content from the video provider's Atom feeds, [blog posts][4] that have the video embedded in it, and other pieces of data from a [data warehouse project][5].

There is no set structure across all of the items (each of them will be very domain-specific, actually), the only thing that will relate them is the natural key of the video mentioned above.

That said, once I have this information in one of the above solutions, I'll want to do a number of things with it:

- Cull it to help populate variables in a [random forest][6] in order to make classifications about the videos
- Provide general search on the videos (general free-text, not based on the results of the random forest) through a web-based front end (ASP.NET MVC if you must know)

There are some requirements:

- I will more than likely be in a ASP.NET shared web hosting environment.  This means I'll have one machine, and won't have access to set up a service.  Something embeddable will be *very* helpful.

- The ASP.NET environment will be hosted in IIS, so the embeddable aspect will have to survive [app-domain recycling][7].

- I'll want to create new indexes based on the results of the statistical analysis which I can easily fascet which will help with the search on the site.

- Support for autocomplete functionality (I know this isn't an ""out-of-the box"" request, but being able to get to that point is important).

- Rich synonym support (there's a number of them in the type of videos I'm indexing content around)


I'm also open to services, such as [Truffler][8], although I do have concerns about the cost (and in Truffler's case, a little concerned about latency between the data centers, because the requests will come from the web host on the West coast, or from a back-end process on the East coast).

Additionally, I don't feel that *one* solution needs to fit *all* the requirements.  I'm more than fine with having one serve one purpose and having another serve another purpose.  Granted, [migrations suck][9], but migrating between these two document stores is a little easier (and I don't expect them to use the same document structure, necessarily).

I'm not asking about how to accurately time a piece of code using something like `System.Diagnostics.Stopwatch` or even `QueryPerformanceCounter`.

Also, I've read the related questions:

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/448761/accurate-windows-timer-system-timers-timer-is-limited-to-15-msec

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/163022/high-resolution-timer-in-net

Neither of which supplies a useful answer to my question.

In addition, the recommended MSDN article, [Implement a Continuously Updating, High-Resolution Time Provider for Windows][1], is about timing things rather than providing a continuous stream of ticks.

With that said. . .

There's a whole lot of bad information out there about the .NET timer objects.  For example, `System.Timers.Timer` is billed as ""a high performance timer optimized for server applications.""  And `System.Threading.Timer` is somehow considered a second class citizen.  The conventional wisdom is that `System.Threading.Timer` is a wrapper around Windows [Timer Queue Timers][2] and that `System.Timers.Timer` is something else entirely.

The reality is much different.  `System.Timers.Timer` is just a thin component wrapper around `System.Threading.Timer` (just use Reflector or ILDASM to peek inside `System.Timers.Timer` and you'll see the reference to `System.Threading.Timer`), and has some code that will provide automatic thread synchronization so you don't have to do it.  

`System.Threading.Timer`, as it turns out *is not* a wrapper for the Timer Queue Timers.  At least not in the 2.0 runtime, which was used from .NET 2.0 through .NET 3.5.  A few minutes with the Shared Source CLI shows that the runtime implements its own timer queue that is similar to the Timer Queue Timers, but never actually calls the Win32 functions.

It appears that the .NET 4.0 runtime also implements its own timer queue.  My test program (see below) provides similar results under .NET 4.0 as it does under .NET 3.5.  I've created my own managed wrapper for the Timer Queue Timers and proved that I can get 1 ms resolution (with quite good accuracy), so I consider it unlikely that I'm reading the CLI source wrong.

I have two questions:

First, what causes the runtime's implementation of the timer queue to be so slow?  I can't get better than 15 ms resolution, and accuracy seems to be in the range of -1 to +30 ms.  That is, if I ask for 24 ms, I'll get ticks anywhere from 23 to 54 ms apart.  I suppose I could spend some more time with the CLI source to track down the answer, but thought somebody here might know.

Second, and I realize that this is harder to answer, why not use the Timer Queue Timers?  I realize that .NET 1.x had to run on Win9x, which didn't have those APIs, but they've existed since Windows 2000, which if I remember correctly was the minimum requirement for .NET 2.0.  Is it because the CLI had to run on non-Windows boxes?

            static void Main(string[] args)
            {
                // Create a list to hold the tick times
                // The list is pre-allocated to prevent list resizing
                // from slowing down the test.
                List<double> tickTimes = new List<double>(2 * TestDuration / TickFrequency);
    
                // Start a stopwatch so we can keep track of how long this takes.
                Stopwatch Elapsed = Stopwatch.StartNew();

Second, and I realize that this is harder to answer, why not use the Timer Queue Timers?  I realize that .NET 1.x had to run on Win9x, which didn't have those APIs, but they've existed since Windows 2000, which if I remember correctly was the minimum requirement for .NET 2.0.  Is it because the CLI had to run on non-Windows boxes?

                // The list is pre-allocated to prevent list resizing

However on any other operation (such as insert/update/delete), I am getting errors.
 I found the answer at http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/forums/thread.jspa?messageID=14222306 which stated that my DB2 client driver was not configured for transactions.
However, under <db2_inst_home>/sqllib/cfg folder there is no db2cli.cfg file present (or anywhere else on my computer)
Also, I am able to modify the tables from the green screen/java application.
Here is one of my methods : 

    using (var context = new Data.S06E11E4Entities2()) {
                string sql = ""select * from schemaname.tablename where FLD='V2'"";

                CUST c = rows.First(); // This is giving me the correct data

                if(c.EntityState == System.Data.EntityState.Detached)

Should I go for another versions/ installation of DB2 express-C that installs the .NET driver/provider.
Can I use any other approach for data persistence within the entity framework (for example in jpa/hibernate we can use explicit Transactions).

I am using the DB2/400 as my application backend. I am able to make queries and read successfully from the database.
However on any other operation (such as insert/update/delete), I am getting errors.
 I found the answer at http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/forums/thread.jspa?messageID=14222306 which stated that my DB2 client driver was not configured for transactions.
However, under <db2_inst_home>/sqllib/cfg folder there is no db2cli.cfg file present (or anywhere else on my computer)
Also, I am able to modify the tables from the green screen/java application.
Here is one of my methods : 

    using (var context = new Data.S06E11E4Entities2()) {
                string sql = ""select * from schemaname.tablename where FLD='V2'"";
                var rows = context.ExecuteStoreQuery<CUST>(sql, null);
                CUST c = rows.First(); // This is giving me the correct data

                if(c.EntityState == System.Data.EntityState.Detached)
                    context.CUSTS.Attach(c);
                context.CUSTS.DeleteObject(c);

                context.SaveChanges();

My questions are : 

Should I go for another versions/ installation of DB2 express-C that installs the .NET driver/provider.
Can I use any other approach for data persistence within the entity framework (for example in jpa/hibernate we can use explicit Transactions).

As is probably obvious, I am taking a snapshot of the current stack, and would like to provide file and line number information in the stack dump.  The *Managed Stack Explorer* does this by querying `ISymUnmanagedMethod::GetSequencePoints`.  This is great, but the sequence points are associated to offsets, and I have so far assumed these are offsets from the beginning of the method ( in intermediate language ).

In a follow-up comment to his blog post [Profiler stack walking: Basics and beyond][1], David Broman indicates that this mapping can be achieved using `ICorDebugCode::GetILToNativeMapping`. However, this is not ideal as getting this interface requires attaching to my process from another, debugger process.

I would like to avoid that step because I would like to continue to be able to run my application from within the visual studio debugger while I am taking these snapshots.  It makes it easier to click on the line number in the output window and go to the code in question.

The functionality is possible.... you can spit out a line-numbered stack trace at will inside of managed code, the only question, is it accessible.

I have used CDB with SOS to try to determine what is happening but the data does not seem to make any sense so I was hoping one of you may have experienced this before.

The application is running on the 64 bit framework.  It is continuously calculating and serialising data to a remote host and is hitting the Large Object Heap (LOH) a fair bit.  However, most of the LOH objects I expect to be transient: once the calculation is complete and has been sent to the remote host, the memory should be freed.

Obviously I would expect this to be the case if my application were creating long-lived, large objects during each calculation.  (It does do this and I accept there will be a degree of LOH fragmentation but that is not the problem here.)  The problem is the very small (1056 byte) object arrays you can see in the above dump which I cannot see in code being created and which are remaining rooted somehow.

Also note that CDB is not reporting the type when the heap segment is dumped: I am not sure if this is related or not.  If I dump the marked (<--) object, CDB/SOS reports it fine:

    0:015> !DumpObj 000000005e62fd38
    Name: System.Object[]
    MethodTable: 00000642788d8ba8
    EEClass: 00000642789d7660

    Array: Rank 1, Number of elements 128, Type CLASS
    Element Type: System.Object
    Fields:
    None

The elements of the object array are all strings and the strings are recognisable as from our application code.

Also, I am unable to find their GC roots as the !GCRoot command hangs and never comes back (I have even tried leaving it overnight).

So, I would very much appreciate it if anyone could shed any light as to why these small (<85k) object arrays are ending up on the LOH: what situations will .NET put a small object array in there?  Also, does anyone happen to know of an alternative way of ascertaining the roots of these objects?

So if I run this test with this line:

    document = XDocument.Load(reader);

It will result in some in some improperly formated XML:

    <Test>
        <Node><SubNode /></Node>
    </Test>

However, if I simply uncomment this line:

    document = XDocument.Parse(XDocument.Load(reader).ToString());

The result will be OK:

    <Test>
      <Node>
        <SubNode />
      </Node>
    </Test>

Very weird.

<b>Notes:</b>

To run this make sure you have C:\Test.xml:

To reproduce this bug I have a xml file saved in C:\Test.Xml with this:

    <Test>
        <Node/>

In .NET, all objects are either value types or reference types. Reference types are allocated on the heap while value types are allocated on the stack (in the current CLR implementation, anyway). I get that. It is also true that, in VB.NET, you don't have to call a constructor on a value type. You can do this:

    Public Structure Coordinates
        Public x As Integer
        Public y As Integer
        Public z As Integer
        
        Sub New(ByVal x As Integer, ByVal y As Integer, ByVal z As Integer)

            Me.y = y
            Me.z = z
        End Sub
    End Structure

With this code in place, I can write `Dim c As Coordinates` and then access the members of `c` myself, or I can write `Dim c As New Coordinates(10, 20, 30)`. What is the difference between these two approaches? Obviously the `new` keyword is not allocating the object on the heap since it's a value type. I'm just not clear on whether constructors on value types are merely a convenience or if they actually *do* something other than execute like any other method.

To perhaps make my point clearer: I could easily have removed the definition for `New` in the above code, and still I could do this:

    Dim c1 As Coordinates
    Dim c2 As New Coordinates

Do these two lines do anything different?

    				Header=""New Contact"">

I need to create an exact copy of this in Ironpython but with a different name, can anyone help with this, the parent tabcontrol of this tabitem is this:
<!-- language: lang-xml -->

    <TabControl
    			x:Name=""AddContactTab""
    			HorizontalAlignment=""Left""
    			Grid.Row=""0""
    			Grid.Column=""0""
    			Width=""1090""
    			Margin=""0,0,0,23.75"">
    			<TabControl.Background>
    				<SolidColorBrush
    					Color=""Green""
    					Opacity=""0.30"" />
    			</TabControl.Background>

Can anyone give me an idea on how should I tackle this from python code?

The team I'm in is developing using Windows 7 Professional and Visual Studio 2008 (for what it's worth), and when some of the code produced is run on different versions of windows (in my example, Windows XP Professional with .Net 3.5 installed) we get some slightly strange behaviour.

What I've noticed is a very specific set of nested ifs (that each call the same method, but with different parameters), within a switch block seems to be behaving differently at run-time on one specific machine than it is on the development machines. An example of what I mean is this:

    switch (someVariable)
    {
        case true:
            //do some stuff
            //this case seems fine when stepped through
            break;
        case false:
            //do some stuff
            //this is the case that causes problems
            if (Foo())
            {
                if(Bar())
                {
                    someOtherMethod();
                    //I'll call these the nested ifs
                    if (object.SomeValue == targetValueOne)
                        FooBar(string, someParam, int anotherParam);
                    if (object.SomeValue == targetValueTwo)
                        FooBar(string differentStrParam, int differentIntParam);
                    else
                        FooBar(string thirdStrParam, int thirdIntParam);
                }
            }
            else
            {
               //do some different things
            }
            break;
    }

The example is overly complicated, but it still holds (pretty much) true to the code I have in front of me (there are extra if's to check object.SomeValue's value).

On the Windows 7 (development) machines, the code runs perfectly - I've stepped through it with each permutation of object.SomeValue and each code path is executed as planned. However, when this code is run on a Windows XP (belonging to a tester) machine, the nested ifs don't seem to even get called, especially when Bar() returns true.

There are two versions of FooBar(), one that returns and one that doesn't. I'm explicitly calling the version that doesn't, here.

Foo() and Bar() are two different set-up methods, if they complete the set-up steps then they return true, otherwise they return false.

As I've said above, When this code is run on the tester's machine, the nested ifs are skipped entirely. Whereas they are evaluated correctly on the development machines. I know that the JIT compiles to bytecode at run time, and that bytecode is specific for the machine that it's running on.

So, I guess I'm asking if anyone knows whether it could be the JIT on the tester's machine is what's causing these nested ifs to be skipped, or whether I've missed something out? Or could the JIT compiler be trying to optimise this block and producing code that doesn't actually perform the way it's supposed to?

My team got involved in this project to evolve one of our main applications. As the application is obsolete from our point of view, we decided to move on and start building the application from scratch, using new technology available, including data manipulation and access. So, we choose to implement EF in our architecture.

The old application was built on top of layer's pattern using old ADO.NET to realize Data Access Layer, and we're having difficult in order to replace/adapt this layer to accommodate EF.

The new application will be built as a ASP.NET Web Forms (I know there's MVC, but we have our reasons) and here is when we get lost. This system, at its main core, has a collection of pages in which the user enters information. This collection kinda act as a ""Wizard"", where user places information step by step. He enters some information, click next, the system creates some objects based on the information he entered (saves to the session), and go to the next page; user enters other information, system creates other objects and move to next page....and so on, until final page, where user clicks 'finish' and the system inserts all the information of the objects in the database.

This is the scenario.
So, to design the app, I started to do a lot of research this past week. Looking for EF, ObjectContext, Repositories, Unit of Work and some other patterns, trying to understand how this fits altogether.

I'm going to point out some things:


 1. As we have experience and knowledge with the domain, I thought it would be a good idea to work with an EF Code-First approach, so we can be guided by DDD, using POCOs. Am I wrong?
 2. If I got it right, the Code-First is not my main concern, as it's not so difficult to place it in DAL.
 3. While I was reading, I got confused about the necessity of implementation of Repositories and Unit of Work, and data transactions. This isn't implemented in EF?
 4. I didn't figured out how ObjectContext will remain preserved between page requests, or how I'm going to let all the objects of my BusinessLayer be aware of the same ObjectContext, so I can add the objects as the users advance in the wizard. I read [this article][1] that gave me a good idea, but I don't know if there's something more ""sofisticated"". (saw some comments in the article above saying this is not a good practice)
 5. I'm looking for a way to implement my BS and DA Layers in order to reuse in another project, with a different presentation layer (like a mobile or desktop app). Is this possible?


I saw many articles focused on EF for desktop applications and some others to ASP.NET MVC.
What I ask you is to give me some guidance in order to solve these issues, and finally design the architecture.

If I haven't made my point, let me know as I can give you more details/explain better.
I've never needed to post 'cause I always found the solution in some other user's posts. But this time I'm kind of lost and in a boat without a paddle.

Any help/ideas will be appreciated.

Thx in advance.

Taken another way:

 1. **Program** maintains a **List(Of A)**
 2. **A** is created as an instance of **AppDomain** using _CreateInstanceAndUnwrap_
 3. Each **A** refers to **mirror.dll**, which is including in the application's references

All of this is fine and dandy except that when setting up the Domain, the call to InitializeLifetimeService is not respected... kind of.  After waiting the default 5 minutes and making a call to one of my A's, I get the RemoteException error.  However, putting in some Try/Catch statements I discovered that I _can_ reach the A in question, but it fails when it tries to RaiseEvent.  In addition, it seems that the DLL object itself is dropped (or it also fails when trying to RaiseEvent, which it does often). 

[According to this article](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.appdomain.initializelifetimeservice.aspx), the override in AppDomain should automatically create a lease that doesn't expire. So I try this:

    _ADomain = AppDomain.CreateDomain(Name)
    _ADomain.InitializeLifetimeService()
    Dim item As A
    item = CType(_ADomain.CreateInstanceAndUnwrap(GetType(A).Assembly.FullName, GetType(A).FullName), A)

No dice.  According to [another MSDN article](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/23bk23zc.aspx), overriding InitializeLifetimeService and returning Nothing will do the same thing.  So, within the A Class, I do:

    <SecurityPermissionAttribute(SecurityAction.Demand, _
                                     Flags:=SecurityPermissionFlag.Infrastructure)> _
    Public Overrides Function InitializeLifetimeService() As Object
        Return Nothing
    End Function

Yet again, nothing happens. So, going by [yet another article](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.marshalbyrefobject.initializelifetimeservice%28v=vs.100%29.aspx), I try to just set a long lease:

    <SecurityPermissionAttribute(SecurityAction.Demand, _
                                     Flags:=SecurityPermissionFlag.Infrastructure)> _
    Public Overrides Function InitializeLifetimeService() As Object
        Dim lease As ILease = CType(MyBase.InitializeLifetimeService(), ILease)
        If lease.CurrentState = LeaseState.Initial Then
            lease.InitialLeaseTime = TimeSpan.FromDays(5)
            lease.SponsorshipTimeout = TimeSpan.FromDays(5)
            lease.RenewOnCallTime = TimeSpan.FromDays(5)
        End If
        Return lease
    End Function

Part of the problem for this seems to be that I never get A in the Initial state. But that shouldn't be an issue if I use the previous setup and always return Nothing, right? Unfortunately, there's very little out there in the way of examples for doing this kind of thing, so I may well be doing something wrong.  I'm all ears for how I should approach this, the entire project is for naught if I can't get over this problem.

I should probably mention that the (third party, closed source) DLL is not serializable and is highly unlikely to inherit MarshalByRefObject. This is why I put the class into the AppDomain and not the DLL, but may be part of the problem.

I did some other research and it looks like the WURFL project might be a better solution for being able to retrieve much more information about devices/browsers.

There has been numerous topics on SO, discussing what DI Container for .NET is best and what the options are. Most of these questions are from back 2009, and DI Containers landscape appear to have changed since than.

Now don't get me wrong. I'm, strongly convinced that it does not matter *that much* which DI Container to choose as long as you give it some thought and choose one. By the way this is true not only about DI containers, but also about many other cross-cutting concerns.

However within an organization it is better to settle on a particular technology, so that developers can gain expertise on this technology and can apply it across the projects. This does not mean that aforementioned technology should be set in stone for all projects. It simply means, that if *there is no compelling reason* for a project to chose one DI container over another, no time is spent discussing which container must be used, because a ""preferred"" recommendation is set up front.

I'm trying to figure out what can make a good recommendation, as per above. Again: it is not possible to choose one-fit-all technology, but it should be possible to choose a ""default"" one.

This leads me to comparison criteria of DI containers. There are [numerous][1] [benchmark][2] [comparisons][3] of different DI Containers in the net. However some people things, that [performance should not be choosing criteria][4] for a DI container. There are [anecdotal evidences][5] though, that performance could matter.

[This guy][6] put together a set of comparison criteria for different DI containers, it's a very good starting point, however there are a lot of DI containers features that are not on the list. Features like ability to support AOP-style interception and ability to register object instantiation via delegates immediately come to mind. Support for container hierarchies is another feature that is not mentioned on the list and there are many more. Support of ASP.NET MVC is usually easy to add but it's nice if it's provided out of the box or with an out-of-the-box extension.

As of the moment of writing there are more than a dozed of different DI Containers. In my mind I roughly categorize them like this:

**Dinosaurs:** 

 - [Castle.Windsor][7]  
 - [StructureMap][8]  
 - [Spring.Net][9]

'Dinosaurs' does not mean 'bad'. It means that they have a very long history, thus very mature, may have modern features but the core was developed before .NET 3.5 came around which affects their architecture. They are all available via NuGet.

**LinFu:**
 
 - [LinFu][10] - LinFu is set aside in my mind. Unlike many other projects mentioned in my list, this one didn't see many recent releases. [This article][11] makes it sound like the author has given up on the project, although I'm sure this is not true. 
 - [Hiro][12] - Same article, introduces this experimental container that pre-compiles object instantiation/injection code so that resolution time becomes comparable to the time without using DI at all. Sounds interesting, but I haven't heard any reports of production use, and (may be my fault), this is the only project that did not work out-of-the box for me when I got is with NuGet. 

**Modern:**

 - [Unity][13] 
 - [Autofac][14] 
 - [Ninject][15] 
 - [LightCore][16] 

These containers are based on .NET 3.5 and do not give an impression of ""aged"" in any way. Unity has a drawback of being over-engineered. I don't agree with the author of [this article][17], that the simplest way to work with the decorators in Unity is obtuse, in fact many other containers implement it exactly this way. But I do strongly agree, that whenever there is a need to customize Unity to do something that it is not doing out of the box it is a major pain. 

LightCore looks nice, fast and stable, however not nearly enough documentation and it is not [obvious][18] how to implement aforementioned decorators with it. [Anyone][19]?

All these are available via NuGet.

**Minimalistic:**
 
 - [Funq][20] - limited number of features but easy to setup and fast.
 - [Munq][21] - like Funq, but with wired-in support for ASP.NET MVC and WCF
 - [Petite][22] - Really tiny one - fits in one .cs file. Flexible lambda based registration, but but not much else.
 - [MicroIoC][23] - minimalistic container for Windows Phone 7 

Some of these are available via NuGet.

**Those I've never heard of anyone using:**

 - [S2Container.NET][24] 
 - [PicoContainer][25] 

They are mentioned on Scott Hanselman's [page][26] listing different DI Containers available. I've never came across them in any other context.

These are not available via NuGet.

Another criteria is availability of commercial support. I understand that [support][27] for Castle.Windsor is available, but I think this is about it. Ninject mentions paid support on the [contribute page][28], but no email or link is given, and since this support is most likely is not backed up by an established company it may not be reliable.

My thinking currently, that Castle.Windsor is appealing because of maturity and  availability of commercial support. Unity is appealing because is backed up (although not supported) by Microsoft. Autofac and Ninject are appealing in modern, easy to use, extend and understand department, with Ninject is winning in the easy to get started category.


Now, getting this out of the way we are coming close to my real question. To be able to choose one DI container over another it is necessary to have comparison criteria. Obvious ones are feature supported. Since there is no ""official"" list of DI features, I'd like you to answer the question in the title: If you prefer a particular DI, what features of this DI that are important for you are not to be found (or not as easy to implement/use) in other DIs? 

Thank you in advance for all the input!

I'm sorry this is a very long question. I'm looking for help from people passionate about DI Containers enough to read it through. Thank you for you time!

There has been numerous topics on SO, discussing what DI Container for .NET is best and what the options are. Most of these questions are from back 2009, and DI Containers landscape appear to have changed since than.

Now don't get me wrong. I'm, strongly convinced that it does not matter *that much* which DI Container to choose as long as you give it some thought and choose one. By the way this is true not only about DI containers, but also about many other cross-cutting concerns.

However within an organization it is better to settle on a particular technology, so that developers can gain expertise on this technology and can apply it across the projects. This does not mean that aforementioned technology should be set in stone for all projects. It simply means, that if *there is no compelling reason* for a project to chose one DI container over another, no time is spent discussing which container must be used, because a ""preferred"" recommendation is set up front.

I'm trying to figure out what can make a good recommendation, as per above. Again: it is not possible to choose one-fit-all technology, but it should be possible to choose a ""default"" one.

This leads me to comparison criteria of DI containers. There are [numerous][1] [benchmark][2] [comparisons][3] of different DI Containers in the net. However some people things, that [performance should not be choosing criteria][4] for a DI container. There are [anecdotal evidences][5] though, that performance could matter.

[This guy][6] put together a set of comparison criteria for different DI containers, it's a very good starting point, however there are a lot of DI containers features that are not on the list. Features like ability to support AOP-style interception and ability to register object instantiation via delegates immediately come to mind. Support for container hierarchies is another feature that is not mentioned on the list and there are many more. Support of ASP.NET MVC is usually easy to add but it's nice if it's provided out of the box or with an out-of-the-box extension.

As of the moment of writing there are more than a dozed of different DI Containers. In my mind I roughly categorize them like this:

**Dinosaurs:** 

 - [Castle.Windsor][7]  
 - [StructureMap][8]  
 - [Spring.Net][9]

'Dinosaurs' does not mean 'bad'. It means that they have a very long history, thus very mature, may have modern features but the core was developed before .NET 3.5 came around which affects their architecture. They are all available via NuGet.

**LinFu:**
 
 - [LinFu][10] - LinFu is set aside in my mind. Unlike many other projects mentioned in my list, this one didn't see many recent releases. [This article][11] makes it sound like the author has given up on the project, although I'm sure this is not true. 
 - [Hiro][12] - Same article, introduces this experimental container that pre-compiles object instantiation/injection code so that resolution time becomes comparable to the time without using DI at all. Sounds interesting, but I haven't heard any reports of production use, and (may be my fault), this is the only project that did not work out-of-the box for me when I got is with NuGet. 

**Modern:**

 - [Unity][13] 
 - [Autofac][14] 
 - [Ninject][15] 
 - [LightCore][16] 

These containers are based on .NET 3.5 and do not give an impression of ""aged"" in any way. Unity has a drawback of being over-engineered. I don't agree with the author of [this article][17], that the simplest way to work with the decorators in Unity is obtuse, in fact many other containers implement it exactly this way. But I do strongly agree, that whenever there is a need to customize Unity to do something that it is not doing out of the box it is a major pain. 

LightCore looks nice, fast and stable, however not nearly enough documentation and it is not [obvious][18] how to implement aforementioned decorators with it. [Anyone][19]?

All these are available via NuGet.

**Minimalistic:**
 
 - [Funq][20] - limited number of features but easy to setup and fast.
 - [Munq][21] - like Funq, but with wired-in support for ASP.NET MVC and WCF
 - [Petite][22] - Really tiny one - fits in one .cs file. Flexible lambda based registration, but but not much else.
 - [MicroIoC][23] - minimalistic container for Windows Phone 7 

Some of these are available via NuGet.

**Those I've never heard of anyone using:**

 - [S2Container.NET][24] 
 - [PicoContainer][25] 

They are mentioned on Scott Hanselman's [page][26] listing different DI Containers available. I've never came across them in any other context.

These are not available via NuGet.

Another criteria is availability of commercial support. I understand that [support][27] for Castle.Windsor is available, but I think this is about it. Ninject mentions paid support on the [contribute page][28], but no email or link is given, and since this support is most likely is not backed up by an established company it may not be reliable.

    206080   .hello.zettaneer.com

I see:

    206080   .hello.com
    206080   .hello.com
    206080   .hello.com
    206080   .hello.com
    206080   .hello.com

Using SQL profiler, it seems that the correct query is being executed. For whatever reason however, it brings the incorrect values in .Net.

Any suggestions much appreciated.

Following [this][1] article about WCF addressing as it specifically relates to multiple endpoints in IIS I see these two excerpts:

*""Suppose you have a file named calc.svc and you place it in a virtual directory that corresponds to (http://localhost:8080/calcservice). The base address for this service will be (http://localhost:8080/calcservice/calc.svc).""*

and

*""Now, consider the endpoint configuration found in the virtual directory’s web.config file (in Figure 3). In this case, the address of the first endpoint becomes the same as the base address (http://localhost:8080/calcservice/calc.svc) since I left the endpoint address empty. The address of the second endpoint becomes the combination of the base address appended with ""secure"", like this: (http://localhost:8080/calcservice/calc.svc/secure).""*

Now in my application I'm trying to create two endpoints for the same service (shown below). The service name is MainService.svc. For endpoint one I have address="""" and endpoint two has address=""Soap11"". Bringing the site up in IIS I can successfully hit this URL: (https://localhost:444/MainService.svc). This is the base address for the service according to all the documentation I can find. According to this article and others I have seen that confirm its information I should have the second endpoint at (https://localhost:444/MainService.svc/Soap11) but if I navigate to that URL I get a .Net exception indicating the resource is not found.

Is there a tool I can use to *see* where my different endpoints will be available? Maybe some IIS or aspnet_isapi.dll logging I can turn on? My web.config section defining my endpoints follows.

At the moment, I have a database schema consisting of things such as customers and users. Each customer can have their own departments. Each department can have a set of users. Each user can have a name, authentication details, etc. A colleague reminded me that Active Directory already has infrastructure to support this kind of hierarchies, so rebuilding this from scratch may not be optimal.

Now, my problem is that I will need much more entities than just customers, users and so on. I will have to store statistics, documents, contacts (which aren't users in the sysetm) and other information as well. To pick a number out of thin air, there may be 10-20 additional entity types which does not already exist in Active Directory. These entity types will be 'linked' to customers, users, and so on. The users in this system is not users in my local network but will be accessing my software over the internet.

I have only a very vague understanding of Active Directory, but as I understand it I would have to extend the AD schema to store my own entities. I would have to add properties to ""Organizational unit"" such as ""document list"".

An alternative method could be to rely on the organizational units, users and groups in AD and have a separate MSSQL database to store the remaining data. My MSSQL database would then have to link entities such as 'contact' to a specific OU or user using it's unique identifier or whatever it's called.

Any thoughts on this? Is it wise to store complex types in AD rather than in a MSSQL database?

Researching the subject, I couldn't find a single document that will contain a comprehensive set of tools that will prevent (or at-least slow-down) the hacking / reverse-engineering of .net assemblies.

This is not a single/best answer type of article. Instead, I would appreciate any thoughts, comments, additions, subtractions or insights you might have on the subject. They will help me pick a good solution for my problem, but will also help to enrich the set of ideas and measures that can be taken against code attacks - for other readers to use. 

I will start by specifying my personal goals and assumptions, continue to list the tools and methods I found to assist in protecting the assemblies and will end with a thought about performance.


**Goals**

1.	Protect intellectual-property that will reside on an end-user machine.
2.	Prevent .net assemblies from being (ab)used by hackers.
3.	Raise as many shields possible in order to make assembly-hacking as unpleasant an experience as can be.

**Assumptions**

 - The code to protect is a set of full-trust .Net 2.0 assemblies.
 - Because these are full-trust assemblies, CAS renders useless for this solution.
 - Client-Server (WebServices, Cloud-Computing) is not an option.
 - The assemblies will be subject to attacks.

**Suggested Security Shields**

These are the tools / arsenal I could come up with in order to create an “assemblies community”, in which assemblies may communicate with each other but may not be contacted by an outside source.

 1. Sign all assemblies with the same strong-name key.<br>This has two benefits:
 - A. Make sure any modification to an assembly will render it useless,
 - B. All assemblies will have the same public key, by which they can identify each other.
 2. Digitally sign the assemblies: Both let the users know that the executed code came from the correct source, and – add another identification component by which assemblies could identify each other.
 3. Enforce the above by crawling up the call-stack and verifying that all callers are inside the “community”.<br>Possible leads:
 - Hallgrim’s idea in [this S.O. thread][1].
 - Daniel Brückner‘s addition in [this S.O. thread][2].
 - This [.Net Security Blog Post][3], which combines both solutions.
 4. Use AOP (e.g. [Spring.NET][4]) to inject the call-stack crawling code into some/all methods.
 - This is mainly done because there’s no single entry point (like DllMain() for Win32 DLLs) in a .net assembly.
 5. Obfuscate all assemblies in order to hamper reverse-engineering and reflection-execution attempts (strong name signing will be performed after obfuscation, of course).
 6. Integrate a [System.ComponentModel.LicenseProvider][5] mechanism.
 7. Make use of the “InternalsVisibleTo” assembly-level attribute in order to expose internals among a pre-defined set of assemblies.
 8. Possibly use NGEN in order to convert the solution to native code.

**Performance Impact**

 - Implementing part or all of the above will most-likely introduce a performance penalty, so time-critical processing, for example, should be handled with care.

            i_n_utentes.ID = ctrlName;
            i_n_utentes.Name = ctrlName;
            c_n_utentes.Controls.Add(i_n_utentes);
            tr.Controls.Add(c_n_utentes);
                
            parent.Controls.Add(tr);
        }
        
    }

But now I need to access all the inputs to validate and other processing.
I've been trying this ways:

This one only returns htmlControls that I've written on the aspx.

     foreach (Control ctrl in Form.Controls) {
            if (ctrl is HtmlControl)
            {
                HtmlControl htmlCtrl = ctrl as HtmlControl;
               
                Response.Write(""ID: "" + htmlCtrl.ID + ""             CLASS = "" + htmlCtrl.Attributes[""class""] +""         type = ""+ htmlCtrl.GetType() + ""<br/>"");
            }
        }

This way I get the rendered elements, but only the name.
I've tried to recunstruct the ID of the element and use the FindControl method but the ""Form"" doesn't return any element that way.

            foreach (Object formObj in Request.Form) {
            string formObjID = formObj.ToString().Replace(""$"", ""_"");
            Control ctrl = Form.FindControl(formObjID);
        
        }

Can anyone unstuck me from this one?
The main objective is really just to access the rendered elements so I can validate them and serialize the Data to an XML, and really don't know if this is the right approach.

Thanks in Advance.

<h2>Setting the scene</h2>

I'm using code generation to generate C# wrapper / interop classes for custom types defined in a domain specific language.  These custom types support named attributes of various types, and are currently exposed to .Net code as an instance of a `CustomType` class:

    // Simple example use of CustomType class
    void Test(CustomType widget)
    {
        string someString = widget.GetString(""SomeString"");
        int myInteger = widget.GetInt(""MyInteger"");
        CustomType gadget = widget.GetCustomType(""MyGadget"");
    }
    
These types also support a simple inheritance heirachy in that if a custom type ""Widget"" inherits from another type ""Gadget"", then an instance of ""Widget"" will inherit all the attributes defined on the ""Gadget"" type as well as its own attributes.

Of course if you try to ""Get"" an attribute of the wrong type (or an attribute that doesn't exist) then things go horribly wrong - my generation process produces a class for each custom type that has generated properties with the correct names / types:

    void Test(Widget widget)
    {
        string someString = widget.SomeString;
        int myInteger = widget.MyInteger;
        Gadget gadget = widget.MyGadget;
    }
    
I've been using this for a while now and it helps out a lot with catching all the silly type conversion errors at compile time rather than runtime, however there is one remaining thing thats niggling at me:

<h2>How should I support ""casting"" of these generated types?</h2>

I've also added the ability to cast between these generated custom types, for example:

    // Remember that Widget : Gadget
    Widget widget = new Widget();
    Gadget gadget = widget; // Implicit cast
    Widget widget = (Widget)gadget; // Explicit cast
    Bucket bucket = (Bucket)widget;  // Invalid cast causes compile time error (Bucket is another generated type)
    
Again all of the above works (using cast operator overloading), however the problem start to come when I don't know what the custom type is:

    void Test(CustomType someObject)
    {
        Widget widget = (widget)someObject;
    }
    // And (more tricky)
    void Test(object someObject)
    {
        Widget widget = (widget)someObject;
    }
    
As far as I can see I have three ways to implement this:

**1)** If I do the obvious thing and have my generated types inherit from each other and  CustomType then I get problems because I can't overload casting between types that inherit from each other:

    void Test(CustomType someObject)
    {
        // If someObject is actually an instance of the .Net CustomType class then the following cast fails
        // even if the underlying object is really a widget.
        Widget widget = (widget)someObject;
    }
    
This means that casts (such as the above) may or may not fail depending on the way that the custom object is instantiated, which is *incredibly scary*!  For various reasons it is very difficult to control the way that these objects are instantiated (for example, most of the time instantiating custom types is done in common assemblies that have no knowledge of the generated types)

2) The alternative that I've gone for is to have none of my generated types inherit from each other and instead generate suitable cast operator overloading methods in each of my generated types, this means that the above example works, however I have problems with unboxing object types:

    void Test(object someObject)
    {
        // Again If someObject is actually an instance of CustomType then the following all goes wrong

This is much much better as I can guarentee that casts between generated types will work consistently, and I only need to cast to a custom type from object at a couple of places (and in those cases it is normally safe to assume that it is a `CustomType`), however it *feels* really messy to have all those operator overloads, and casting from `object` is a faff:

    void Test(object someObject)
    {
        Widget widget = (widget)(CustomType)someObject;
    }

3) Failing that, I can scrap casting and force people to create new instances of the generated types when they ""cast"":

    void Test(object someObject)
    {
        Widget widget = new Widget(someObject);
        Gadget gadget = new Gadget(widget);
    }
    
But this means I loose the compile time type safety when converting between types (as the objects all need to accept a constructor with an input of type `object`), and looks messy.
    
My current favourite is #2 - Is there any way to get casting of these generated to work any nicer?

Failing that, has anyone got any alternative suggestions (for example a way of creating instances of the correct wrapper object in assemblies that don't ""know"" about the generated types?)
",.net,code-generation,dynamic-cast,,,,open,0,1010,7,"Supporting artificial ""casting"" of generated .Net types (I applogise in advance for the length of this post, however the problem is fairly complex - hopefully everything is clear however I have simplified the scenario a lot and so there is a good chance that I've missed a vital fact, or there is something that I've not explained.)

<h2>Setting the scene</h2>

I'm using code generation to generate C# wrapper / interop classes for custom types defined in a domain specific language.  These custom types support named attributes of various types, and are currently exposed to .Net code as an instance of a `CustomType` class:

    // Simple example use of CustomType class
    void Test(CustomType widget)
    {
        string someString = widget.GetString(""SomeString"");
        int myInteger = widget.GetInt(""MyInteger"");
        CustomType gadget = widget.GetCustomType(""MyGadget"");
    }
    
These types also support a simple inheritance heirachy in that if a custom type ""Widget"" inherits from another type ""Gadget"", then an instance of ""Widget"" will inherit all the attributes defined on the ""Gadget"" type as well as its own attributes.

Of course if you try to ""Get"" an attribute of the wrong type (or an attribute that doesn't exist) then things go horribly wrong - my generation process produces a class for each custom type that has generated properties with the correct names / types:

    void Test(Widget widget)
    {
        string someString = widget.SomeString;
        int myInteger = widget.MyInteger;
        Gadget gadget = widget.MyGadget;
    }
    
I've been using this for a while now and it helps out a lot with catching all the silly type conversion errors at compile time rather than runtime, however there is one remaining thing thats niggling at me:

<h2>How should I support ""casting"" of these generated types?</h2>

I've also added the ability to cast between these generated custom types, for example:

    // Remember that Widget : Gadget
    Widget widget = new Widget();
    Gadget gadget = widget; // Implicit cast
    Widget widget = (Widget)gadget; // Explicit cast
    Bucket bucket = (Bucket)widget;  // Invalid cast causes compile time error (Bucket is another generated type)
    
Again all of the above works (using cast operator overloading), however the problem start to come when I don't know what the custom type is:

    void Test(CustomType someObject)
    {
        Widget widget = (widget)someObject;
    }
    // And (more tricky)
    void Test(object someObject)
    {
        Widget widget = (widget)someObject;
    }
    
As far as I can see I have three ways to implement this:

**1)** If I do the obvious thing and have my generated types inherit from each other and  CustomType then I get problems because I can't overload casting between types that inherit from each other:

    void Test(CustomType someObject)
    {
        // If someObject is actually an instance of the .Net CustomType class then the following cast fails
        // even if the underlying object is really a widget.
        Widget widget = (widget)someObject;
    }
    
This means that casts (such as the above) may or may not fail depending on the way that the custom object is instantiated, which is *incredibly scary*!  For various reasons it is very difficult to control the way that these objects are instantiated (for example, most of the time instantiating custom types is done in common assemblies that have no knowledge of the generated types)

2) The alternative that I've gone for is to have none of my generated types inherit from each other and instead generate suitable cast operator overloading methods in each of my generated types, this means that the above example works, however I have problems with unboxing object types:

    void Test(object someObject)
    {
        // Again If someObject is actually an instance of CustomType then the following all goes wrong
        Widget widget = (widget)someObject;
    }
    
This is much much better as I can guarentee that casts between generated types will work consistently, and I only need to cast to a custom type from object at a couple of places (and in those cases it is normally safe to assume that it is a `CustomType`), however it *feels* really messy to have all those operator overloads, and casting from `object` is a faff:

    void Test(object someObject)
    {
        Widget widget = (widget)(CustomType)someObject;
    }

3) Failing that, I can scrap casting and force people to create new instances of the generated types when they ""cast"":

    void Test(object someObject)
    {
        Widget widget = new Widget(someObject);
        Gadget gadget = new Gadget(widget);
    }
    
But this means I loose the compile time type safety when converting between types (as the objects all need to accept a constructor with an input of type `object`), and looks messy.

I haven't tried it exactly like this but I would like to specify one target in the NLog.config file and to specify another through the API at runtime. To do this, I'm taking the config that loads automatically, adding additional targets and loggers to it, and then feeding it back into LogManager:

    Dim config As LoggingConfiguration = LogManager.Configuration
    
    With fileTarget

    LogManager.Configuration = config

However this solution doesn't work - the app only logs to the event log specified in the config file. If I remove this logger, then the file logger works fine. Checking the LogManager.Configuration object at runtime confirms that there are two Logging rules with the same name, and two targets.

I'm currently working on using a SplitGroup target; I expect this solution will work, even if it requires a bit more coding.

Thank you in advance!

I'm going to build stand-alone intranet site that would provide additional functions to legacy ones. I want to use current authentication data - this way I have to pass SID from html browser somehow without prompting user to enter login/password e.t.c. 

Does UserSID/WorkstationName/UserName are sendable via HTTP(s) protocol after being configured some way? 
If no what technologies would you suggest to use: 
May be I shall use [Silverlight + WMI abilities][1] or may be it's possible to access WMI from javascript (so I should consider traditional ajax).

When running this program, four exceptions of type `RuntimeBinderException` are thrown. You can observe this either by breaking on all thrown exceptions (Debug/Exceptions.../check the Common Language Runtime Exceptions Throw checkbox) or by using perfmon:

![enter image description here][1]

Now these exceptions are obviously caught and handled internally because the `TryInvokeMember` method is called afterwards. However, it seems heavy-handed and an inappropriate use of exceptions if you subscribe to the ""use exceptions only in exceptional circumstances"" mantra. For my specific example it's not really a problem because the same members - `Foo` and `Bar` - are repeatedly invoked. However, I have other scenarios in mind where the members are far less static.

Is there anything that can be done to help the runtime invoke `TryInvokeMember` without throwing any exceptions?

When running this program, four exceptions of type `RuntimeBinderException` are thrown. You can observe this either by breaking on all thrown exceptions (Debug/Exceptions.../check the Common Language Runtime Exceptions Throw checkbox) or by using perfmon:

![enter image description here][1]

Now these exceptions are obviously caught and handled internally because the `TryInvokeMember` method is called afterwards. However, it seems heavy-handed and an inappropriate use of exceptions if you subscribe to the ""use exceptions only in exceptional circumstances"" mantra. For my specific example it's not really a problem because the same members - `Foo` and `Bar` - are repeatedly invoked. However, I have other scenarios in mind where the members are far less static.

Is there anything that can be done to help the runtime invoke `TryInvokeMember` without throwing any exceptions?

I am using [Twitterizer][1] to get me the required secret tokens. This library also provides a way to update your twitter with a new tweet, but it does not support the new update_with_media call.

I've tried several ways, one way by using WebRequest and the other way by using WebClient (pseudo-C#-code):

    string URL = ""https://upload.twitter.com/1/statuses/update_with_media.json?oauth_consumer_secret=[mysecretgoeshere]&oauth_token_secret=[usersecretgoeshere]"";
    System.Net.ServicePointManager.Expect100Continue = false;
    Byte[] fileData = File.ReadAllBytes(pathToFile);
    
    #if useWebRequest
    	string postString = ""status={statusgoeshere}&image[]={Encoding.ASCII.GetString(fileData)}"";
    	Byte[] postData = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(postString);
    
    	WebRequest wr = WebRequest.Create(URL);
    
    	wr.Method = ""POST"";
    	wr.ContentType = ""multipart/form-data""; //as required by twitter API
    	wr.ContentLength = postData.Length;
    
    	IO.Stream rqstream = wr.GetRequestStream();
    	rqstream.Write(postData,0,postData.Length);
    	rqstream.Close();
    
    	wr.GetResponse(); //returns status 500 internal server error
    #else
    	WebClient client = new WebClient();
    	NameValueCollection postData = new NameValueCollection();
    
    	postData.Add(""status"", ""{statusgoeshere}"");
    	postData.add(""media[]"", Encoding.ASCII.GetString(fileData));
    
    	client.UploadValues(URL, ""POST"", postData); //returns status 401 not authorized

This is my setup: I've got two projects in the same solution. The first is a C++/CLI project we'll call `Foo`. `Foo` is a library project that depends on an external library (the Java Runtime Environment), and thus has the appropriate reference to the appropriate (I believe since it compiles) .lib file. (I changed no other project setting related to loading that library.) My other project, `Bar` is a C# console executable project that references `Foo`.

Both compile just fine.

However, when I execute my `Bar.exe` C# program, it dies before the construction of the first object that requires types from `Foo`. The exception is a `FileNotFoundException` that states the `Foo.dll` assembly or one of its dependencies couldn't be found.

So I launched `fuslogvw` to see what went wrong, but I don't really understand how it works, and the documentation I found on it is rather unhelpful. From what I think I understand, both `Foo` and `Bar` failed to load as native images, but were found to be correct IL and were properly loaded that way.

So I started adding methods to the data object for answering specific questions which the manipulating objects need to know. The manipulating objects only have methods strictly related to manipulation or to some feature while info on the data object is elaborated by it. The manipulating objects asks and the manipulated object responds. That is how I imagined it at first. Then I realised they could as well be methods of the manipulating objects or extension methods.

I feel the data object is starting to have too many methods related to specific features, and more are to come. Since these features are mainly managed by the manipulating objects, they could be moved and distributed between them. The problem is some of these methods are used by different manipulating objects and manipulating objects are full enough of methods which are specifically related to manipulation. So another option would be to implement them as static extension methods and place them in the namespace where such works are carried out (so they are only visible from the working area but can be called by other objects if need be).

The question is where to put methods that:

 - give info elaborated from data object info (public info), without any kind of manipulation
 - are for the specific use of one or a few other objects for specific features (manipulation mainly, but also queries and presentation)
 - (some use helper business objects, some only depend on the data object and require nothing else)

Should they belong to:

 - the data object
 - the manipulating objects
 - to a static helper class in business namespace ?

I suppose the answer depends a lot on which methods we are talking about, on the design of the application, etc. so I understand specific advice may be difficult to give, but I would appreciate any tips which help me make a decision in this and other cases.

1. Clone my control and then transform cloned one, unaffecting original.
 Didnt work, for some reason i ended with exception: The provided DependencyObject is not a context for this Freezable, but oddly only in some cases.

2. Revert size and position changes. I tried calling InvalidateArrange() method, which seemed to work, but only during first call of print method. During second call, it didnt work.

Additionally, there is an asp.net asmx web service that performs address validation by going out to a third party web service.

I am curious how to deal with this functionality. I don't want to put the service reference and code to access the web service in the domain layer.  It also seems wrong to put it in the application layer.

My current best solution is to create a third assembly that references the original domain layer AND the validation web service.  This keeps my domain layer a bit cleaner with no external references.  How would you handle this situation?",3

A colleague has told me that Associative Arrays are a language construct only recognised within PL/SQL code on Oracle, and not by pure SQL. Given that our Oracle developers are encouraged to write set-based SQL wherever possible, it seemed the natural choice to opt for UDT tables.

----------
## Context ##
It would seem that WCF does not do CORBA as standard, which is a shame as that would have been my preferred route.  CORBA itself seems very much one of ""last years"" technologies, and I think thats why Google has fails to be my friend on this topic!

## Context ##
It would seem that WCF does not do CORBA as standard, which is a shame as that would have been my preferred route.  CORBA itself seems very much one of ""last years"" technologies, and I think thats why Google has fails to be my friend on this topic!

In either view the user can click an object and it will be selected in both views. Multiselect is also possible, so each `ViewModel` instance has its own `IsSelected` property.

Currently I'm binding `ListBoxItem.IsSelected` to `ViewModel.IsSelected`, but this only works properly if the `ListBox` is NOT virtualizing ([see here][2]). Unfortunately, disabling virtualization hurts performance and my app has become too slow.

So I have to enable virtualization again. In order to maintain the `ViewModel.IsSelected` property of off-screen items, I noticed that `ListBox` and `ListView` have a `SelectionChanged` event that I can (presumably) use to propagate the selection state from the `ListBox/ListView` to the `ViewModel`.

My question is, how do I propagate selection state in the reverse direction? The `SelectedItems` property of `ListBox/ListView` is read-only! Suppose the user clicks an item in the graphical representation, but it is off-screen w.r.t. the list. If I just set `ViewModel.IsSelected` then the `ListBox/ListView` will be unaware of the new selection, and as a consequence it will fail to *deselect* that item if the user clicks a different item in the list. I could call `ListBox.ScrollIntoView` from the `ViewModel`, but there are a couple of problems:

 - In my UI it's actually possible to select two items with one click if they are in the same location graphically, although they may be located in completely different locations in the `ListBox/ListView`.
 - It breaks ViewModel isolation (my ViewModel is totally unaware of WPF and I'd like to keep it that way.)

So, my dear WPF experts, any thoughts?

But now I have a number of questions.

Does my attempt to span dynamic and non-dynamic in a legacy system represent a misconception on my part? Meaning, am I working against dynamic's intent? Am I setting myself up for problems?

In the case of a component like Massive, if we say it is bad practice to map between ExpandoObject and strongly typed objects, then there is no way I can plug it into my legacy system since it must surface business objects into the legacy code and there is no practical way I can, or should, refactor the objects of a large, legacy code base into dynamic objects. Maybe dynamic can't be realistically added to a legacy .Net code base. Maybe it has to be incorporated from the beginning, or not at all.

This class implements an interface (ITask) that is known on the server.
I'm trying to send a Task object from client to server without copying the assembly of the client manually to the server.

If I just serialize the task object, the server obviously complains about the missing assembly.
I then tried to serialze typeof(Task).Assembly but could not derserialize it on the server.
Next I tried to File.ReadAllBytes(typeof(Task).Assembly.Location) and saved it to a temporary file on the server, which threw an exception on Assembly.LoadFrom(@"".\temporary.dll"");

Why am I doing this? Java RMI has a neat feature to request the implementation of an object that is received through remoting but is stil ""unkown"" (this JVM doesn't have the *.class file).

This class implements an interface (ITask) that is known on the server.
I'm trying to send a Task object from client to server without copying the assembly of the client manually to the server.

If I just serialize the task object, the server obviously complains about the missing assembly.
I then tried to serialze typeof(Task).Assembly but could not derserialize it on the server.
Next I tried to File.ReadAllBytes(typeof(Task).Assembly.Location) and saved it to a temporary file on the server, which threw an exception on Assembly.LoadFrom(@"".\temporary.dll"");

Why am I doing this? Java RMI has a neat feature to request the implementation of an object that is received through remoting but is stil ""unkown"" (this JVM doesn't have the *.class file). This can be used for a compute server that just knows the interface of a ""task"" containing a run() method and downloads the implementation of this method on demand.

I thought about using Silverlight for its user-friendliness and its WPF design so close to the rich clients the future users are used to.

The project (of course) requires access to a database also within the intranet, hence I browsed the internet to see how data access was handled. I was surprised to see that you apparently _have_ to use web services to interact with data, as mentioned in [this SO post][1] which points [this tutorial][2] (one of many ways to use webservices).

Having already created various rich client within an intranet all interacting with database, I was surprised to be forced to use web services.

Indeed, I do understand the advantages of the web services; the security it provides, and all the other features of created a good DAL generally in software architecture. However, I can't see why you can't simply create (for example) a library containing the Linq to SQL classes and use this library as reference in the silverlight project to access data directly as you can do with classic rich client application. I understand that by doing that, you store the access data within the connection string of the app, but I can't see why it shouldn't work with a silverlight client.

So, two questions:

 1. Do we actually _have_ to access data through web services?
 2. If so, why is it different from the classic rich client approach?

These assemblies are relatively new and in a state of flux as new features are implemented, etc.  As a result, it is not unusual for them to be rebuilt and redistributed somewhat frequently.  I would expect this to decrease as the assemblies are stabalized, but it is what it is today.

Right now, the assemblies are placed into a Common folder where the development projects can reference the same assemblies.  Applying updates is as simple as replacing the files and the development projects automatically pick-up the changes the next time they are loaded and built.

The problem I have is that we may have several ""layers"" of assemblies built upon the framework - for instance, we have a Core library shared by all applications and a Server library that references Core and is shared by all Server application.  All of the dependancies also have to be rebuilt each time the framework assemblies are updated, making this a very large task.  I don't believe I can use the GAC because this would require that all of the developers update their systems each time a new version is released.

I've investigated Publisher Policies but have some doubts that this will solve my problem for a few of reasons:

* For one, I don't want to recreate the file each time I rebuild my framework assemblies - is there a way I can automate this process?

* It is not clear to me if it requires that the assemblies go into the GAC.  As I said, I don't want to force my developers to reinstall, update, etc. each time we release a new version of the assemblies.

* I don't have any control over network setup and configuration, so it is necessary to avoid the whole ""trust"" issue by placing the files in a network share.  Plus, many of our developers work in a sometimes connected fashion and we'd want the files available to them when disconnected.

The goal would be to make updating these assemblies transparent to our application developers that are consuming them.  We will undoubtedly install these assemblies into the GAC on the target machine when the application is installed, but we don't want to do so for development purposes.  It is also not reasonable to include the projects in each application's Solution because they are developed by different teams.

Then you want the path and name of that handle and try to access the Name property of your FileStream object, and it returns 'unknown'.

This is true for the constructors which takes file handles:

    public FileStream(IntPtr handle, ...
    public FileStream(SafeFileHandle handle, ...

I know the short answer, because it's not implemented. The private field `_fileName` of `FileStream` is never assigned in those constructors.

Seems the [API][1] to get the name from a handle involves more than one line of code, but I still think they could have bothered to include this.

Suppose you have a program that is performing some operation on user-supplied information (such as a search string) that changes as the user types it. Suppose that you want to show the user the most relevant information for what they've typed at any given time.

If threads were really abortable, we could simply have one thread running based on the last-changed search string, and cancel any previous threads that were in progress.

Now the generally accepted best practice for doing this today is to use a delay timer as the user types, which waits for .5 to 1 second before initiating the operation. I hope it's obvious enough that this isn't an *ideal* solution, theoretically speaking (any kind of artificial delay imposes an artificial bottleneck that can never be overcome, even if it is only 0.5 seconds).

Furthermore, today's best practice goes on to state that any subsequent operations should wait for the previous one to complete before executing. In a world where we can't abort operations, this makes sense, but again, theoretically speaking this is far from ideal. Imagine the user types a single character and pauses just long enough for the operation to begin. Suppose that this operation takes 10 seconds to execute. The user is now forced to wait an unacceptable amount of time before the results of his/her query are visible.

An (unideal) workaround to this would be to have multiple operations executing concurrently, presuming it is safe to do so, but this would still result in significantly reduced performance.

So I'm just wondering people's thoughts on this, specific to .NET at least, and whether there are any new developments in this area since I last researched it that I should know about (parallel libraries perhaps?). I'd also be curious to know if any other languages/frameworks can handle this sort of fine-grained control of operations better than .NET can.

(Management know nothing about development and only see the problem in transferring projects from one developer to another. Customers pay by the hour and development is a small part of total project so code quality is a non-issue)

My first step is to set up guidelines for C# and VB.Net (SQL will probably come later).

(Most code here is created with <kbd>CTRL-C</kbd><kbd>CTRL-V</kbd> and testing is done with <kbd>F5</kbd>.  
I have tried to introduce unit testing / code review but that is not going to happen. Static analysis is the only way forward at the moment)

I am most comfortable in C#/C++ (but sometimes work with existing VB6/VBA/VB.Net code) so setting up C# guidelines is pretty easy:

* Warning Level 4
* StyleCop
* FxCop
* Code metrics (e.g. Cyclomatic complexity < 15, Maintainability > 50)

For VB.Net I need to replace StyleCop with some written guidelines but how do I set up the VB.Net compiler.
Personally I never code without `Option Explicit` / `Option Strict` etc but if I do that on our VB.Net projects I get hundreds of warnings/errors (implicit conversions, default return type/value etc).

The VB developers does not seem to have a problem working without help from compiler warnings. I do not think their productivity generally differs from C# developers (it is more a personal thing).

I do not want to enforce my own preference for static checking so my questions is:  
**What warning levels are reasonable/best practice for VB.Net development?**

(English is not my first language so I hope this does not sound like I think VB.Net or VB Developers are inferior to C# in any way. I just don't have much experience in VB.Net projects)

I don't want to begin using this beta version though to realize that once the RTM release comes out none of it will work or run into issues... ",5

1) Our application has a 3-tier architecture – a Silverlight application, a web tier and a backend business logic tier. 

 - The business logic tier (largely legacy code) runs as a Windows service. 
 - We have one service for each client. 
 - There are multiple business logic servers in the system, each running multiple Windows services for our clients
 - The Silverlight browser application will communicate with the web tier via a set of WCF web services and the web tier will communicate with the business logic via .NET Remoting.  
 - Each client’s windows services will establish a TCP port for remoting endpoints when it starts.
 - The role of the web tier is to get an incoming request and route it to the correct service.

2) We have a sporadic issue in our SilverLight application. Users will see a message in the interface that says either “Cannot open log for source 'ExceptionManagerInternalException'. You may not have write access” or “A call to SSPI failed, see inner exception.” Both errors are caused by the same issue, users with admin rights on the system will see the second message, 'normal' client users will see the first.

3) More details of the error can be seen in either the event logs on the web server.  In the system event log, we see:

> The Kerberos client received a KRB_AP_ERR_MODIFIED error from the
> aaa$. The target name used was HOST/bbb.cab.local. This indicates that
> the target server failed to decrypt the ticket provided by the client.
> This can occur when the target server principal name (SPN) is
> registered on an account other than the account the target service is
> using. Please ensure that the target SPN is registered on, and only
> registered on, the account used by the server. This error can also
> happen when the target service is using a different password for the
> target service account than what the Kerberos Key Distribution Center
> (KDC) has for the target service account. Please ensure that the
> service on the server and the KDC are both updated to use the current
> password. If the server name is not fully qualified, and the target
> domain (domain.LOCAL) is different from the client domain
> (domain.LOCAL), check if there are identically named server accounts
> in these two domains, or use the fully-qualified name to identify the
> server.

4) We have captured trace files that have allowed us to see the events that occur when we get this bug:

 - A SOAP call comes into the Web API (WCF)
 - A client id is recovered from the http header. The client id allows us to uniquely identify a user working at an instance of a browser and was put into the header when the client first logged on to the system. When they logged on, we also cached the client id, together with the service that they connect to, on the web server.  This is implemented in a WCF behaviour on our endpoint.
 - Using this lookup, the address of the system (ie the name of the server and the tcp port) and the SPN of the service (HOST\<server name>) are put onto thread storage.
 - We have used logging (NLOG) to confirm that this process is happening ok
 - The code on the web tier will then make a .NET Remoting call to the server.
 - The code in the web tier then makes the .NET Remoting call(s) to the business logic tier.
In the ClientChannelSink, we get the address of the server and SPN from thread storage and configure the remoting call to go to the correct destination. NLOG traces have confirmed that the correct details are retrieved from thread storage and used to configure the call.  We saw a trace where a request was made by UserA@domain.local to go to aaa using an SPN of HOST\aaa).
 - From a network monitor trace, we can see DNS packages and the correct ip addresses are returned for the server names.
 - From a network monitor trace, we can see that a Kerberos ticketing request is made to the DC.
 - This request will contain the SPN for a different server than expected (in our trace, the request asked for HOST\bbb)
 - The Kerberos ticketing service returns a valid Kerberos ticket for the user (UserA@domain.local) for the requested service (HOST\bbb)
 - A request is sent to the expected service (server aaa), using the valid Kerberos ticket for the wrong service.
 - The service (on server aaa) rejects the request. This is legitimate since the Kerberos ticket is for not for HOST\aaa but HOST\bbb

I don’t think any of the ‘advice’ in the event log is the cause of this issue:
- We don’t have any duplicate SPNs on our system
- Both computers are on the same domain
- The issue is sporadic; the issues listed in the message look like they would cause total failure all of the time.

I have read about asp.net thread agility, but I don’t think that this is causing this issue, since we always send our request to the correct server, but with the wrong Kerberos ticket.  If we were using the ‘wrong’ settings from thread storage, then we would send the request to the wrong server with a matching Kerberos ticket for that server.
Any help to the cause or how to investigate this further would by much appreciated.

I'm creating a software adapter for [potentially many types of] mobile hardware devices.  I've got a couple of assemblies and I'm using a class factory pattern to do this, which was a team decision.  We talk to each of the mobile devices through a 3rd party webservice relevant to the mobile platform upon which the device sits.  We have no control over this.

So far I've got 3 assemblies so far which represent:

- An adapter library which contains the interface definition for each of the adapters, some base classes and the class factory to instantiate any of the provided adapters.
- An adapter implementation to connect to one of these types of hardware device.
- My application which references each of the adapters configured.

Now to my question:

Given that I don't want to be adding webservices to the main application [as that's not relevant to the main application], how do I get each assembly to reference their own webservice configuration?  If I have the webservice configuration in the main application configuration, it works just fine, but if I move the configuration to the adapter's configuration everything stops working and all I get is ""Exception has been thrown by the target of invocation."" at the point where I come to new up a reference to the Soap1Client.

In an ideal world, I'd like to not have *any* configuration file for the webservice, but this will likely need reconfiguring at some point or other and having to recompile each of the adapters in that event would be a pain.

First of all, I want to have my library working FAST, as it was in unmanaged environment. Thus, I am not sure if the first approach will not cause a large decrease in performance. However, it seems to be faster to implement (not a right word :-)) (assuming it will work for me). 

On the other hand, I think of some problems that might appear while writing a wrapper (e.g. how to wrap some STL collection (<code>vector</code> for instance)?)

Basically, I want to set a permission on a top level folder object that has potentially 100,000+ file and folder objects below it. I want the permission to be inheritable via all sub folders and sub files (IE '*Applies to files, folders, and subfolders*' is **true**).

I don't want to  trash any existing inheritable permissions (IE '*Replace all child object permissions with inheritable permissions from this object*' is **false**).

So, when I run a Set-ACL, SetACL.exe, XCACLS.vbs, or even use the Windows GUI, it takes a very long time for the process to complete - obviously due to the large size of the sub directory. 

I'm used to this now, BUT:

 - I'm not traversing the directory; 
 - I'm not modifying the individual ACLs on the sub files and folders (I don't think); and
 - I'm not replacing permissions

I assumed that if you accessed the sub folder/file object, it would check it's explicit ACEs to see if you had permissions, and if you didn't have it, it would then check for any inheritable permissions (from parent folder objects) that might give you access.

So, does setting an inheritable permission also cause a new, individual ACE to be written to every single sub file and folder, even though you are technically only setting one ACE at the top level?

Is there **any** way to set an ACE at the top level and not have the command to go and enumerate through the whole sub directory?

I recently was requested to write a web service where the calling client was a Linux based program named ""WGET"". I would like to use WCF instead of a traditional ASMX web service. The web service is returning a standard XML response. I am not sure of the underlining details between the two technologies but I know WCF is the proper route. I created a WCF service to be hosted in IIS ( using basicHttpBinding).  

1.) Did classic ASMX web services ( standard HTTP POST/GET) use SOAP to return responses? I created an class from XSD for the web service response. What is really going on behind the scenes? Is there just special XML HTTP headers that know how to handle to response? Is the response not wrapped in SOAP? The traditional ASMX web service worked perfectly with the class I generated using the .Net ""XSD"" program.

2.) I want to use WCF for this service. Will using basicHttpBinding work? As I have read, that is the correct binding to use for ASMX clients. Does this use SOAP, standard HTTP headers, or something else?


3.) This is a dumb question because I have not done a lot of web service programming. I noticed on the ASMX default landing page there were examples for responses and code to invoke the functionality. When I create the same service using WCF, I had to create a client application to perform these tasks. Is there a way to expose the WCF endpoint like a classic ASMX service or is the WSDL the only route?

As always, I really appreciate the feedback. 

Thanks,
Brennan

The traditional ASMX web service worked perfectly with the class I generated using the .Net ""XSD"" program.

2.) I want to use WCF for this service. Will using basicHttpBinding work? As I have read, that is the correct binding to use for ASMX clients. Does this use SOAP, standard HTTP headers, or something else?


3.) This is a dumb question because I have not done a lot of web service programming. I noticed on the ASMX default landing page there were examples for responses and code to invoke the functionality. When I create the same service using WCF, I had to create a client application to perform these tasks. Is there a way to expose the WCF endpoint like a classic ASMX service or is the WSDL the only route?

As always, I really appreciate the feedback. 

Thanks,
Brennan

I'm trying to develop a custom caching mechanism that I can apply to custom built user controls. (Please be aware that I know that there are some built in caching mechanism already in .NET) Depending on certain flags set declaratively in the mark-up the control should load a cached version of its previously rendered content or execute normally (and if certain flags are set it should generate a cache of its content for next time it loads). I would like to be able to pass certain flags declaratively in the mark-up and being able to check their value at Page Init and, depending on the flag value, determine whether the control should load a cached version or not.


    <uc:MyUC ID=""N1"" runat=""server""
       CacheProp='<%# SomeEnum.A | SomeEnum.B |SomeEnum.C %>'
       PropA='<%# this.SomePropA %>' 
       PropB='<%# (this.SomePropB %>'
       PropC='<%# this.SomePropC %>'
    />

The problem that I'm facing is that as far as I'm aware I can only get the value of the properties declaratively assigned in the mark-up if I called the DataBind(). However I'm faced with two problems: 
Firstly calling `this.DataBind()` from within `MyUC` will trigger the binding of all its child controls which would defeat the purpose of the cache; also all user controls have been built so that they will not call `DataBind()` before the `LoadComplete` event has fired, so to make sure that the parent controls they live in has done its initialisation and has computed the properties that are declaratively passed to the child user control (ie `PropA`, `PropB`, `PropC`).

And now the question: is there a way to  bind the `CacheProp` property so to retrieve its value without data binding all other properties and without triggering the data binding of all its child controls?

Thanks for helping!

But I am doubt about effectiveness of the approach to use Resources and 3-d party resource editing tools to localizing large .NET applications.

I am thinking about staying with one of the below approaches:

1. Set Localizable=True for all solution forms, and use 3-d party resource editor, for ex: Zeta Resource Editor, to edit and manage resources.
Disadvantages: 
- Our solution has ~100 forms, and for 30 extra languages there will be 30*100 = 3000 new resx files!
- A lot of efforts to interact with translators: I need to send them excel files with plain text after each product and manually update project resources after each language changes.
- Part (most?) of the language files will be always outdated, because translators might do their works after product release, and we can't include their changes without recompiling the project.

2. Use custom Dictionary based class (like GNU GetText), that will load an old-fashioned ini file with translations.
Disadvantage: need to do an extra job, like writing a helper tool to edit ini files for translators.
Advantage: new language versions might be published after product release as a separate ini files.

But I am doubt about effectiveness of the approach to use Resources and 3-d party resource editing tools to localizing large .NET applications.

I am thinking about staying with one of the below approaches:

1. Set Localizable=True for all solution forms, and use 3-d party resource editor, for ex: Zeta Resource Editor, to edit and manage resources.
Disadvantages: 
- Our solution has ~100 forms, and for 30 extra languages there will be 30*100 = 3000 new resx files!
- A lot of efforts to interact with translators: I need to send them excel files with plain text after each product and manually update project resources after each language changes.
- Part (most?) of the language files will be always outdated, because translators might do their works after product release, and we can't include their changes without recompiling the project.

2. Use custom Dictionary based class (like GNU GetText), that will load an old-fashioned ini file with translations.
Disadvantage: need to do an extra job, like writing a helper tool to edit ini files for translators.
Advantage: new language versions might be published after product release as a separate ini files.

Unfortunately I can't compare performance of the both ways.

There is no doubt in my mind that we will eventually take advantage of TPL. What I am questioning is whether it makes sense to start taking advantage of TPL when Visual Studio 2010 and .NET 4.0 are released, or whether it makes sense to wait a while longer.

Why Start Now?
--------------
<ul>
<li>The .NET 4.0 Task Parallel Library appears to be well designed and some relatively simple tests demonstrate that it works well on today's multi-core CPUs.</li>
<li>I have been very interested in the potential advantages of using multiple lightweight threads to speed up our software since buying my first quad processor Dell Poweredge 6400 about seven years ago. Experiments at that time indicated that it was not worth the effort, which I attributed largely to the overhead of moving data between each CPU's cache (there was no shared cache back then) and RAM.</li>
<li>Competitive advantage - some of our customers can never get enough performance and there is no doubt that we can build a faster product using TPL today.</li>
<li>It sounds fun. Yes, I realize that some developers would rather poke themselves in the eye with a sharp stick, but we really enjoy maximizing performance.</li>
</ul>

Why Wait?
---------
<ul>
<li>Are today's Intel Nehalem CPUs representative of where we are going as multi-core support matures? You can purchase a Nehalem CPU with 4 cores which share a single level 3 cache today, and most likely a 6 core CPU sharing a single level 3 cache by the time Visual Studio 2010 / .NET 4.0 are released. Obviously, the number of cores will go up over time, but what about the architecture? As the number of cores goes up, will they still share a cache? One issue with Nehalem is the fact that, even though there is a very fast interconnect between the cores, they have non-uniform memory access (NUMA) which can lead to lower performance and less predictable results. Will future multi-core architectures be able to do away with NUMA?</li>
<li>Similarly, will the .NET Task Parallel Library change as it matures, requiring modifications to code to fully take advantage of it?</li>
</ul>

Limitations
-----------
<ul>
<li>Our core engine is 100% C# and has to run without full trust, so we are limited to using .NET APIs.</li>

Once the script is done I can upload it for all to download and use.

One solution I found online was using the SystemParametersInfo function. However I could not find adequate documentation to get this working from the MSDN library.

It all works fine, except when we make changes to the underlying XML store, those changes do not get reflected in subsequent calls to the AZROLESLib.

Our code looks something like this:


At the class level we store a reference to the authorisation store:

    IAzAuthorizationStore AuthorisationStore = new AzAuthorizationStoreClass();

During construction of our class we initialise the store:

    AuthorisationStore.Initialize(0, XML_STORE_PATH)

    AuthorisationStore.UpdateCache();
    var application = AuthorisationStore.OpenApplication(APPNAME);
    // we do a query here and return the results

However, the call to UpdateCache seems to do nothing at all. I've tried using CloseApplication after every call but it simply throws an exception: ""The request is not supported. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80070032)"". If I new up an AuthorisationStore on every call, I get an Access Denied exception instead (I assume because the old Authorisation Store still has a handle to the file?).

How can I get the authorisation store to refresh itself on every call?

    XmlDocument xmlDoc = GetDoc();
    XmlNamespaceManager nsMgr = new XmlNamespaceManager(xmlDoc.NameTable);
    nsMgr.Add(""foo"",""foo.bar.com"");
    xmlDoc.SelectNodes(""/foo:Orders/foo:Order"", nsMgr);

As I understand it the re-use of the XmlNameTable here isn't mandatory, alternatively we could create a completely new XmlNameTable and pass that into the namespace manager instead. The re-use means that the namespace prefix and URI strings are atomised into the same XmlNameTable as the XmlDocument's string content such that when comparing the namespace URI on each element (when executing the XPath) a fast object compare can be used instead of a full string comparison (compare string length and characters) - presumably because the XPath execution code checks if the XmlDocument and the XmlNamespaceManager are using the same XmlNameTable or not

On the other hand to use this pattern we need to create an XmlNamespaceManager for each XmlDocument we want to execute XPaths against - and register the prefix URI pairs against each one. I suppose ideally we would create the XmlDocument objects using a shared XmlNameTable, perhaps that is the preferred approach if you have control over the construction of the XmlDocument objects(?)

A final concern though is that if we do re-use XmlNamespaceManager(s) then are they thread safe? If I make the assumption that no further prefix-URI pairs will be registered then it should be, but without the ability to lock down the XmlNamespaceManager to prevent modifications being made to it, re-using it on multiple threads would appear to be an unsafe pattern to use. Thus my instinct is to revert back to using a newly constructed XmlNamespaceManager as and when I need one, use the XmlNameTable from the XmlDocument being targeted thus avoiding the need to have any control on the name table used when the XmlDocument was created (which might involve some refactoring effort in existing projects).

If I move the entire system.diagnostics node out of this sub-directory web.config to the application's root web.config, then it magically starts working.

Note that this definition does not include an ""allowDefinition"" attribute, which, according to this [MSDN documentation for the section element][1] means that it can be defined ""Everywhere"" which should include physical subdirectories.  I have not been able to find any system.diagnostics definitions in any parent web.configs either.

Does anyone know why this system.diagnostics configuration might not be getting processed?

If I move the entire system.diagnostics node out of this sub-directory web.config to the application's root web.config, then it magically starts working.  As far as I can tell, the system.diagnostics section is not limited to the application's root web.config, since my machine.config shows this section definition:

<!-- language: lang-xml -->

    <section name=""system.diagnostics"" type=""System.Diagnostics.SystemDiagnosticsSection, System, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089""/>

Note that this definition does not include an ""allowDefinition"" attribute, which, according to this [MSDN documentation for the section element][1] means that it can be defined ""Everywhere"" which should include physical subdirectories.  I have not been able to find any system.diagnostics definitions in any parent web.configs either.

Does anyone know why this system.diagnostics configuration might not be getting processed?

Strictly speaking, this functionality has evolved from simple property comparison to comparing the structural equality of two types. 

    dto.ShouldHave().Properties(d => d.Name, d => d.Address).EqualTo(customer);

But more recently, a change request has been posted that involves adding additional lambda-based overloads for configuring in more detail how FA should compare the two objects. This issue proposed the following syntax.

    actual.ShouldHave()  
      .AllProperties().IncludingNestedObjects()  
      .When(property => property.Name = ""CreatedBy"").DoNotCompare()  
      .When(property => property.GetType() == DateTime).Use(p => p.Actual.Should().BeBefore(p.Expected)

Because it breaks the fluent rhythm of the syntax, I'm not entirely happy with this example. But the next version of FA will be labeled 2.0. Since it already contains a few breaking changes, now is the time to come up with an alternative syntax for asserting the structural equality of two objects. I'm out of inspiration, but maybe something has a better idea. Any suggestion is welcome.

Which is the what's New in Silverlight 4 page on MSDN. But that is almost the only information I can find. I found another post claiming that the ClientHttp will request respect no-cache headers from the server, but I really would prefer that my Silverlight application was not dependent on a server-side setting.

The usual fix to this problem is to simply add a random parameter to each call, but I really would like a more elegant solution.

I was pretty sure that the ClientHttp did not include caching, but after a bit of searching I found this little note: 

> **Client HTTP Processing**

> - Caching support

[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd772166(VS.95).aspx#networking][1]

Which is the what's New in Silverlight 4 page on MSDN. But that is almost the only information I can find. I found another post claiming that the ClientHttp will request respect no-cache headers from the server, but I really would prefer that my Silverlight application was not dependent on a server-side setting.

The usual fix to this problem is to simply add a random parameter to each call, but I really would like a more elegant solution.

**Is there a way to simple disable the cache on `ClientHttpWebRequest`?** - Preferable on single call and not a global setting.

According to the [docs][2], this is supported.

The problem I'm encountering is that when I try to log something, like so (in this example I'm in an ASP.NET MVC application):

    public ActionResult Index()
    {
        ViewBag.Message = ""Welcome to ASP.NET MVC!"";
    
        ILog log = LogManager.GetCurrentClassLogger();

    }

Instead of getting the log message, I'm getting an error in my event log:

Well, there doesn't seem to be any option in Common.Logging to set the default category, and I can't figure out how to configure the LoggingConfiguration to accept any category, even if it isn't defined.

Here's a snippet of my LoggingConfiguration:

    <loggingConfiguration name=""Logging Application Block"" tracingEnabled=""true""

I've tried setting `logWarningsWhenNoCategoriesMatch` to false, but that just silences the warning -- it doesn't make the logging work.

I've also tried getting rid of the `<notProcessed switchValue=""All"" .../>` special source, but that doesn't seem to have any effect either.

During development of .NET Windows applications I keep running into the same problem over and over:

I am eager to use the latest and greatest .NET framework with all the shiny new features, but that requires the user to have that version of .NET installed, which in turn requires an at least moderately up to date version of Windows.

This turns out to be OK in a corporation/private setting, where you can request the client to conform to the requirements.

But when developing applications for clients who want to give the application to outside users of any kind, this quickly grows into a huge problem. 250 MB .NET downloads and limited Windows version compatibility are a big no-no.

I have tried several products that claim to enable the .NET application to work without the .NET framework, but the only ones that work do their job by some form of virtualization, which ends up with huge executables (upward of 100 MB). This is just not the natural way of doing things.

As much as I understand it, my only way of going around this problem is turning to native application development. This rules out all the ""cool"" kinds of development, such as .NET and Java right away.

.NET seems to be for development under ""controlled conditions"", while native applications are ""for the wild"".

I need an up to date development platform, with a good IDE, capable of creating applications for all currently used Windows versions (XP SP1 and upwards would be OK). Also, a language close to C# and libraries close to .NET are preferred, but not a must.

To my knowledge, Visual C++ can create native applications in Visual Studio, but I am worried this is more of an afterthought for MS.

On a server, accessed through citrix, if the application files are located in a directory located on the desktop of the currently logged on user, which is a server/domain administrator, the program runs fine. The .NET windows open as expected.

However, if we move the directory to the root of the same disk, which is a physical disk in the server (so no SAN mapping or anything that would trigger a CASPOL command *to my knowledge*) *and keep everything else the same, same user, same configuration, etc.*, the application silently crashes when we try to invoke the .NET windows. It crashes by way of just disappearing, which suggests it might be something like a stack overflow. We're looking into adding logging to some parts of the app to perhaps be able to figure out what happens, and where, but I'm posting this question here as well.

So far we've verified that there are no oddities in the CASPOL access list, nothing odd in the NGEN cache (I was thinking perhaps there was corrupted images from before, if the server owner had played with it), and no oddities in the GAC (we don't use GAC for the assemblies).

I can't help but feel a little overwhelmed.  I am just starting to come to grip with all the stuff Microsoft added in .NET 3.0 & 3.5 (LINQ, WPF, lambda functions, etc, etc).... I know these things are no longer new, especially for the folks here, but I've been too busy solving real problems for customers... albeit with ""older"" technologies like .NET 2.0, and haven't had time to continually keep up.

Sorry my question is non-technical but I think its very relevant for programmers, both employees and independent consultants, as well as software businesses (which I aspire to start one day):  How to you cope with such rapid change, and still stay relevant?  Do you ignore it until you need it or do you try to stay ahead?  I'd love to stay ahead and stay relevant (read: keep my house and food on table), and not stuck working on legacy stuff, but it just seems like an endless treadmill.  Especially with MS... it seems like they have so much money and people that they just keep pumping out new stuff... and worse, rendering previous technologies obsolete and unsupported (like VB6... something from my previous life).

I believe that the `Path` class should be an immutable type that contains a string known to not contain any invalid characters. Static members should be provided for operating on `string` (as exists now) and an identical set added for working on `Path` objects. Making this change in the .NET Framework:

One thing that I'm unable to determine is the best way to achieve asynchronous calls to a WCF service, or a database? The reason is, I don't want a WCF/DB call to block the UI thread, which causes the UI to just freeze until the operation is done.

From my understanding, I should be following the architecture:

    View (WPF) <=> View Model <=> Application Services <=> DB/WCF

Do I implement the asynchronous behaviour in the view model using something like the [AsyncDelegateCommand][1]? If I do this, then I am unable to maintain any state in the application services, since setting any state needs to be done in the UI thread (unless there's a way around this).

So the other option is to provide async methods with callbacks in the application services and have the application services spawn threads/tasks for the asynchronous operations.

I briefly looked into the Prism StockTrader reference implementation, and they don't seem to do anything asynchronously. I feel that this should be a very common problem, and there must be some best practices out there to deal with this.

I've had a Windows Explorer window on my second monitor looking at the web project's /bin folder, and I can see the log4net dll appear then disappearing after each compile, it seems to happen in sequence (appear, disappear, re-appearm, disappear etc.) rather than randomly.

MyApp.NHibernate project is the only project which references the log4net dll, but GenericLibrary has a reference to NHibernate but NOT log4net. MyApp.NHibernate references GenericLibrary, MyApp.Library also references GenericLibrary, but GenericLibrary stands alone.

The only solution I can think of is to add References to the main MyApp.WebUI project for every external library/dll used in my solution (Nhibernate, log4net, Castle Windsor etc.), to fix the log4net issue and avoid this happening in future. But that's not a very neat/decoupled solution to me.",5

I have a C# application (.NET v3.5) that allows a user to run IronPython scripts for testing purposes. The scripts may load different modules from the Python standard library (as included with IronPython binaries). However, when the script is completed, the memory allocated to the imported modules is not garbage collected. Looping through multiple runs of one script (done for stress testing) causes the system to run out of memory during long term use.

Here is a simplified version of what I'm doing.

Script class main function:

    public void Run()
    {
        // set up iron python runtime engine
        this.engine = Python.CreateEngine(pyOpts);
        this.runtime = this.engine.Runtime;
        this.scope = this.engine.CreateScope();
    
        // compile from file
        PythonCompilerOptions pco = (PythonCompilerOptions)this.engine.GetCompilerOptions();
        pco.Module &= ~ModuleOptions.Optimized;
        this.script = this.engine.CreateScriptSourceFromFile(this.path).Compile(pco);
    
        // run script
        this.script.Execute(this.scope);

        // shutdown runtime (run atexit functions that exist)
        this.runtime.Shutdown();
    }

An example 'test.py' script that loads the random module (adds ~1500 KB of memory):

    import random
    print ""Random number: %i"" % random.randint(1,10)

A looping mechanism that will cause the system to run out of memory:

    while(1)
    {
        Script s = new Script(""test.py"");
        s.Run();
        s.Dispose();
    }

I added the section to not optimize the compilation based on what I found in [this][1] thread, but the memory leak occurs either way. Adding the explicit call to s.Dispose() also makes no difference (as expected). I'm currently using IronPython 2.0, but I've also tried upgrading to IronPython 2.6 RC2 without any success.

How do I get the imported modules in the embedded IronPython script to be garbage collected like normal .NET objects when the scripting engine/runtime goes out of scope?

Most (all?) IoC containers require metadata to be registered with the container to describe how some type should be resolved when asked; this includes the implementation of an interface, the lifetime of the object, etc. Over the past couple of years, the fluent/convention based APIs have been added to most (all?) IoC containers which reduces a lot of the noise when providing this metadata to the container.

With ninject, I am using a conventions based approach to register my metadata, but I do it on demand, not upfront. This yields huge performance savings in an integration test scenario where you are creating ~10 objects; you lose the overhead of having to register the entire application's dependencies every test.

**Note 2: Please do not tell me that you should not use an IoC container in an integration test.**

There is some pressure to move to using Microsoft components when available, so Unity is on my horizon. I have the conventions based registration working, but I cannot figure out how to ""discover"" this metadata on demand/lazily like I could in Ninject.

My first attempt to implement this was using a wrapper around the UnityContainer instance, and upon calling GetInstance(type) on the wrapper, I can query the container to see if the type is registered. If not, I can invoke my conventions, discover the metadata, and register the type. This approach only goes one level deep however; if that type is injected with more dependencies, each dependency does not get fed back into the GetInstance(type) method, and thus, my dilemma.

7520095,09/22/2011 19:09:26,842685,07/13/2011 12:39:18,21,2,"The .NET String: Immutable, Reference-Type...Memory Leak?","There, hopefully that title will get some attention. I realize there is plenty of discussion about immutability in general, about the immutability of String types in multiple languages and runtimes, and about the immutability of the String type specifically in .NET (see [String Class](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.string.aspx)). I would summarize what it means that the .NET String data type is both a reference type and immutable as follows:

 - **A String is a reference-type** in the sense that if you assign an existing string variable to a new string variable, only the reference is copied, not the content. For example:
 1. I can use the String constructor with the arguments (Char, Int32) to create 2-megabyte string consisting of about 1 million 2-byte Unicode 'a' characters:

            string string1 = new string('a', (1024 ^ 2));


 2. Now if I make three new string variables and assign string1 to them, the CLR will only copy a little internal reference to the same 2 Mb string, it will not make 3 new copies of the 2 Mb string:

            string string2 = string1;
            string string3 = string1;
            string string4 = string1;


 - **A String is immutable** in the sense that once created, the value cannot be changed. This means that if I now assign the literal value ""a new value"" to string4, it will **not** overwrite string1's 2 Mb value. Instead it will make a new string and assign a reference to that new string to the variable string4:

        string4 = ""a new value"";

        // string1, string2, and string3 are still 1 million 'a's
        // only string4 == ""a new value""

Now for the memory-leak issue. It arises in the fact that the CLR automatically creates a new string object when assigning a new literal value to an existing string variable. In my above example it is not so obvious. Strings 1, 2, and 3 are still using that 2 Mb list of 'a' characters, so it's no big deal that string4 gets a new object. But what if we keep assigning new values to a single string variable? For example:

    string aString;
    for (int i = 0; i < 256; i++) {
        aString = new string(Convert.ToChar(i), (int)Math.Pow(1024,2));
    }

In this example I zipped through and created 256 strings, where each string consists of about 1 million copies of the two-byte Unicode character with code point i. aString, being a String, is immutable, so for every iteration the CLR makes *a new string object* and reassigns the variable aString to refer to that new object. What about the old string objects? They are stranded.

I am not making this up or misinterpreting this, by the way. To quote verbatim from the String type summary in the official C# reference (see [string (C# Reference)](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/362314fe.aspx), emphasis added by me:

>Strings are immutable--the contents of a string object cannot be changed after the object is created, although the syntax makes it appear as if you can do this. For example, when you write this code, the **compiler actually creates a new string object to hold the new sequence of characters, and that new object is assigned to b. The string ""h"" is then eligible for garbage collection.**

*Eligible* for garbage collection. I know that CLR automagical garbage collector is really cool, but does this mean it automatically, immediately destroys and reclaims memory devoted to abandoned string objects, or what?

To test this to a small extent, I wrote a little console program that does nothing but make and abandon gratuitous strings. Here's the whole program. The ReadKey() is just to give me a chance to open up ProcessExplorer and see what's going on both before and after the loop executes:

    class Program {
        static void Main(string[] args) {
            Console.ReadKey(); 
            int megaByte = (int)Math.Pow(1024, 2);
            string leaker;
            for (int i = 0; i < 2048; i++) {
                leaker = new string(Convert.ToChar(i), megaByte);
            }
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }

I checked the memory usage using Process Explorer. Sure enough, total memory varied between 13 and 15 Mb, even though creating 4 Gb of string content used 50% cpu for a couple of seconds. So the garbage collector is attentive and fast. Memory leak attempted but averted.

Next I made loop that required keeping references to each string. This isn't really a memory leak, just a memory hog:

    class Program {
        static void Main(string[] args) {
            Console.ReadKey(); 
            int megaByte = (int)Math.Pow(1024, 2);
            string[] hog = new string[2048]; 
            char c;
            for (int i = 0; i < 2048; i++) {
                c = Convert.ToChar(i);
                Console.WriteLine(""Generating iteration {0} (char = '{1}')"", i, c);
                hog[i] = new string(c, megaByte); 
            }
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
Naturally, this version crashes around iteration 750 to 800 due to an OutOfMemoryException.

Finally, I did the loop, but every 256th iteration i reset the previous 255 existing array elements to refer to the most recent string value: 

    class Program {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.ReadKey();
            int megaByte = (int)Math.Pow(1024, 2);
            string[] hog = new string[2048];
            char c;
            for (int i = 0; i < 2048; i++)
            {
                c = Convert.ToChar(i);
                Console.WriteLine(""Generating iteration {0} (char = '{1}')"", i, c);
                hog[i] = new string(c, megaByte);
                if ((i + 1) % 256 == 0) { 
                    for (int j = (i - 255); j <= i; j++) { hog[j] = hog[i]; } }
                }
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }

In the end, there should only be 8 strings (2048 / 256), each about 2 Mb. But after the loop is done, the process is still holding on to 570 Mb to 1.1 Gb (it varied). I can wait it out, and it will stay this way for minutes. I almost couldn't believe it. So I added two last pieces to 1) confirm that there were really only 8 unique strings in the array and 2) force garbage collection and see what happens:

    class Program {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Same as above
            
            List<string> uniqueStrings = new List<string>();
            for (int i = 0; i < 2048; i++) {
                if (!uniqueStrings.Contains(hog[i])) { uniqueStrings.Add(hog[i]); }
            }
            Console.WriteLine(""There are {0} unique strings in hog."", uniqueStrings.Count);
            Console.ReadKey();

            GC.Collect();
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
    
Indeed, there *are* only 8 unique strings in the hog array. Further, when I force garbage collection the memory drops WAY down accordingly. As a last experiment, I set a timer for 30 minutes after counting the strings. Note I do not force the process to sleep. It is running along just dandy, listening for the timer's elapsed event while waiting for keyboard input. I.e. the garbage collector has plenty of opportunity to recollect all those abandoned strings:

    class Program {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Same as above
            
            Console.WriteLine(""There are {0} unique strings in hog."", uniqueStrings.Count);

            // Create a timer with an interval of 30 minutes 
            // (30 minutes * 60 seconds * 1000 milliseconds)
            System.Timers.Timer t = new System.Timers.Timer(30 * 60 * 1000);
            t.Elapsed += new System.Timers.ElapsedEventHandler(t_Elapsed);
            t.Start();
            Console.WriteLine(""Waiting 30 minutes..."");

            Console.ReadKey();
        }

        static void t_Elapsed(object sender, System.Timers.ElapsedEventArgs e)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(""Time's up. I'm collecting the garbage."");
            GC.Collect();
        }
    }

At the end of 30 minutes, the process was *still* holding on to all the extra memory until I forced collection. So, fellow programmers, what does this mean to you?",.net,string,memory-leaks,immutable,,09/23/2011 03:47:39,not constructive,1,2032,6,"The .NET String: Immutable, Reference-Type...Memory Leak? There, hopefully that title will get some attention. I realize there is plenty of discussion about immutability in general, about the immutability of String types in multiple languages and runtimes, and about the immutability of the String type specifically in .NET (see [String Class](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.string.aspx)). I would summarize what it means that the .NET String data type is both a reference type and immutable as follows:

 - **A String is a reference-type** in the sense that if you assign an existing string variable to a new string variable, only the reference is copied, not the content. For example:
 1. I can use the String constructor with the arguments (Char, Int32) to create 2-megabyte string consisting of about 1 million 2-byte Unicode 'a' characters:

            string string1 = new string('a', (1024 ^ 2));


 2. Now if I make three new string variables and assign string1 to them, the CLR will only copy a little internal reference to the same 2 Mb string, it will not make 3 new copies of the 2 Mb string:

            string string2 = string1;
            string string3 = string1;
            string string4 = string1;


 - **A String is immutable** in the sense that once created, the value cannot be changed. This means that if I now assign the literal value ""a new value"" to string4, it will **not** overwrite string1's 2 Mb value. Instead it will make a new string and assign a reference to that new string to the variable string4:

        string4 = ""a new value"";

        // string1, string2, and string3 are still 1 million 'a's
        // only string4 == ""a new value""

Now for the memory-leak issue. It arises in the fact that the CLR automatically creates a new string object when assigning a new literal value to an existing string variable. In my above example it is not so obvious. Strings 1, 2, and 3 are still using that 2 Mb list of 'a' characters, so it's no big deal that string4 gets a new object. But what if we keep assigning new values to a single string variable? For example:

    string aString;
    for (int i = 0; i < 256; i++) {
        aString = new string(Convert.ToChar(i), (int)Math.Pow(1024,2));
    }

In this example I zipped through and created 256 strings, where each string consists of about 1 million copies of the two-byte Unicode character with code point i. aString, being a String, is immutable, so for every iteration the CLR makes *a new string object* and reassigns the variable aString to refer to that new object. What about the old string objects? They are stranded.

I am not making this up or misinterpreting this, by the way. To quote verbatim from the String type summary in the official C# reference (see [string (C# Reference)](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/362314fe.aspx), emphasis added by me:

>Strings are immutable--the contents of a string object cannot be changed after the object is created, although the syntax makes it appear as if you can do this. For example, when you write this code, the **compiler actually creates a new string object to hold the new sequence of characters, and that new object is assigned to b. The string ""h"" is then eligible for garbage collection.**

*Eligible* for garbage collection. I know that CLR automagical garbage collector is really cool, but does this mean it automatically, immediately destroys and reclaims memory devoted to abandoned string objects, or what?

To test this to a small extent, I wrote a little console program that does nothing but make and abandon gratuitous strings. Here's the whole program. The ReadKey() is just to give me a chance to open up ProcessExplorer and see what's going on both before and after the loop executes:

    class Program {
        static void Main(string[] args) {
            Console.ReadKey(); 
            int megaByte = (int)Math.Pow(1024, 2);
            string leaker;
            for (int i = 0; i < 2048; i++) {
                leaker = new string(Convert.ToChar(i), megaByte);
            }
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }

I checked the memory usage using Process Explorer. Sure enough, total memory varied between 13 and 15 Mb, even though creating 4 Gb of string content used 50% cpu for a couple of seconds. So the garbage collector is attentive and fast. Memory leak attempted but averted.

Next I made loop that required keeping references to each string. This isn't really a memory leak, just a memory hog:

    class Program {
        static void Main(string[] args) {
            Console.ReadKey(); 
            int megaByte = (int)Math.Pow(1024, 2);
            string[] hog = new string[2048]; 
            char c;
            for (int i = 0; i < 2048; i++) {
                c = Convert.ToChar(i);
                Console.WriteLine(""Generating iteration {0} (char = '{1}')"", i, c);
                hog[i] = new string(c, megaByte); 
            }
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
Naturally, this version crashes around iteration 750 to 800 due to an OutOfMemoryException.

Finally, I did the loop, but every 256th iteration i reset the previous 255 existing array elements to refer to the most recent string value: 

    class Program {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.ReadKey();
            int megaByte = (int)Math.Pow(1024, 2);
            string[] hog = new string[2048];
            char c;
            for (int i = 0; i < 2048; i++)
            {
                c = Convert.ToChar(i);
                Console.WriteLine(""Generating iteration {0} (char = '{1}')"", i, c);
                hog[i] = new string(c, megaByte);
                if ((i + 1) % 256 == 0) { 
                    for (int j = (i - 255); j <= i; j++) { hog[j] = hog[i]; } }
                }
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }

In the end, there should only be 8 strings (2048 / 256), each about 2 Mb. But after the loop is done, the process is still holding on to 570 Mb to 1.1 Gb (it varied). I can wait it out, and it will stay this way for minutes. I almost couldn't believe it.

            List<string> uniqueStrings = new List<string>();
            for (int i = 0; i < 2048; i++) {
                if (!uniqueStrings.Contains(hog[i])) { uniqueStrings.Add(hog[i]); }
            }
            Console.WriteLine(""There are {0} unique strings in hog."", uniqueStrings.Count);
            Console.ReadKey();

            GC.Collect();
            Console.ReadKey();
