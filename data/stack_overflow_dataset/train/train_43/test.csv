And I have some issues concerning scalability of this solution. 

  Some points were mentioned in [this][1] article by Mark Nijhof. But the problem now is the Denormalizer part, which is responsible for updating the reporting database. This part I want to make asynchronous, so after publishing events to the bus I want to return control immediately.  We suggested that Denormalizer could be implemented as a standalone web service (WCF) which will process the incoming events and make updates to the report database in timing fashion with batches of commands. It seems that it could be a bottleneck, so we also want to add some scalability at this point - a cluster solution. But in case of cluster we can't control the sequence of reporting database updates (or we should implement some strange and I guess buggy logic which will check object versions in report DB). Another problem is sustainability of the solution: in case of failure we will loose updates in denormalizer, as far as we do not persist them anywhere). So now I'm lookig for solution of this problem (Denormalizer scalability) any thoughts are welcome!

![db model][1]

  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/qN6dM.png

basically I have **items** that can have multiple **previews** and each preview has a thumbnail (stored in the blob field *Data* in *PreviewThumbnail*). 
I am using self-tracking poco proxies and the repository pattern.
Foreign key constraints are enforced both in the database and the ef model.
Now, because the **PreviewThumbnail** objects contain byte arrays I do not want ef to track them, I just want to be able to load the bite array and do stuff with it and dispose of it in a while. And this is the relevant code: 

	public ObjectSet<PreviewThumbnail> PreviewThumbnails {
		get {
			if (mPreviewsThumbnailsSet == null) {
				mPreviewsThumbnailsSet = CreateObjectSet<PreviewThumbnail>(""PreviewThumbnails"");
				mPreviewsThumbnailsSet.MergeOption = MergeOption.NoTracking;
			}

			return mPreviewsThumbnailsSet;
		}
	}

and this is how I get the bytes for a given preview

	public byte[] LoadImagePreviewThumbnail(Preview preview) {
		var thumb = this.ObjectContext.PreviewThumbnails.First(t => t.Preview.ID == preview.ID);
		return thumb.Data;
	}

Now the as the scene is set up, I am trying to get the delete cascade to work - if an **Item** is deleted, all its **Previews** should also be deleted along with their **PreviewThumbnails**.
Sound good, but when an **Item** is deleted, the following exception is thrown:

    A relationship from the 'FK_PreviewThumbnails_0' AssociationSet is in the 'Deleted' state. Given multiplicity constraints, a corresponding 'PreviewThumbnails' must also in the 'Deleted' state.

If I remove the Cascade OnDelete action from 'FK_PreviewThumbnails_0' exactly the same exception is thrown.

More surprisingly (at least to me), when I change the multiplicity on the **PreviewThumbnail** end (meaning a preview could not have a thumbnail, which of course is not valid) exactly the same exception is thrown.

The last thing I tried was to completely remove the association between **Preview** and **PreviewThumbnail** in the ef model (after all I can do without it), but that is not valid - foreign key in the db should be backed by an association in the conceptual model.

Does any one have an idea of a nice way out of this situation ?

We have a pretty large VB.Net MDI application that has been converted from VB6. When it is first run up with no MDIChild forms opened it uses about 35,000K. As more and more forms are opened (but not closed) the memory usage (according to Task Manager) creeps up at approximately 4,000K per form. (I am aware that T.M. only shows allocated memory for the application, and not the actual memory used.)

The issue is that when the allocated memory reaches a certain point, which is different depending upon what the available memory is on the target machine, no more forms can be opened until one or more of the open forms are closed. The ""limit"" of the ammount of forms that can be opened seems to depend upon the available memory of the machine.

For example:
- On a virtual machine with only 512M for the whole machine it appears to be about 7-8 forms and the allocated memory is around 80,000K when this happens.
- On our terminal server machine which has 3GB and is also running various other thirsty applications it stops at around 20+ forms and a memory allocation of about 100,000 - 105,000K.

I have tried using perfmon to see if there is a leak and that is indicating steady usage.

However, even if I close the forms the allocated memory only drops by about 3000K for the first form closed and then 100K for each form closed after. If I then add a few more forms the memeory increases, and if I then close some the same -3000K, -100K meomry reduction pattern happens again.

Has any one come accross this before? Can any one please help as this is looking like a bit of a show stopper! I look forward to your replies.

Incidentally the original VB6 version does not have this issue and also will return it's memory allocation to that it started with if you close each form rather than the allocation gradually creeping up because teh app releases less than it is allocated.

- On our terminal server machine which has 3GB and is also running various other thirsty applications it stops at around 20+ forms and a memory allocation of about 100,000 - 105,000K.

I have tried using perfmon to see if there is a leak and that is indicating steady usage.

However, even if I close the forms the allocated memory only drops by about 3000K for the first form closed and then 100K for each form closed after. If I then add a few more forms the memeory increases, and if I then close some the same -3000K, -100K meomry reduction pattern happens again.

Has any one come accross this before? Can any one please help as this is looking like a bit of a show stopper! I look forward to your replies.

Incidentally the original VB6 version does not have this issue and also will return it's memory allocation to that it started with if you close each form rather than the allocation gradually creeping up because teh app releases less than it is allocated.

Thanks and kind regards,

They have various underlying structure but all have indexed property which returns an i,j-th image element. I need to display such images in a form. Right now I pre-convert them to System.Drawing.Bitmap and then display it in a standard Winforms PictureBox. My idea is to create a custom control that will have a property of my image type and will display a picture without preliminary converting it to System.Drawing.Bitmap or System.Drawing.Image.

I suggest that the clue to this problem is creating a user-drawn control and overriding OnPaint event there.

I'm sending the Handle of a PictureBox component to my VolumeRender method, VolumeRender method binds the PictureBox component  with vtkRenderWindow, process the pipeline and update the renderWindow. Okay, this process is done outside of UI thread but the problem is, as soon as volume rendering thread is out of scope, UI thread I don't know why but it frees the pictureBox component. Here are the codes;

    private: System::Void volumeRenderButton_Click(System::Object^  sender, System::EventArgs^  e) 
    {
    	volumeRenderThread = gcnew System::Threading::Thread(
    		gcnew System::Threading::ThreadStart(this, &Form1::volumeRender));
            volumeRenderThread->Start(threeDPictureBox->Handle);
    }
    
    private: void volumeRender( System::Object ^obj )
    {				
    	 IntPtr ^ptr = (IntPtr ^) obj;
    	 dicom->VolumeRender((HWND)(ptr->ToPointer()), vrSettings);		
    }
    
    void Dicom::VolumeRender(HWND pictureBoxHandle, VRsettings *settings )
    {
    	renderer = vtkSmartPointer < vtkRenderer > :: New();
    	renderWindow = vtkSmartPointer < vtkWin32OpenGLRenderWindow > :: New();
    	renderWindow->AddRenderer(renderer);

    	...
    	...
    	*/
    
    	renderWindow->Render();
    	iren->Initialize();
    }
I'm sure that the problem is not VTK related. When debugging the code, after the execution renderWindow->Render() statement, in the main form, rendered image is seen on pictureBox Component, but after the volumeRender thread is out of scope, threeDPictureBox is somehow freed.

To achieve scalability, most of the experts will suggests to implement :-

    1) State Management (stateless service)

    3) object pooling
    4) use of MSMQ

Is that both the terms are interdependent? (*I guess NO*)

    Wherever other resources and definition is concern I think : -
    **Performance**: Improving performance means that you execute a given task in less time
    
    **Scalability**: Scalability measures the ability of your system to increase it's throughput when resources are added

Now my issue is simply, how can I call this, I do not know what to set the dict variable to or the images list??

So in essance if I have a PDF located at C:\temp\test.pdf that contains images, how do I call this?

        Dim x As New FileStream(""C:\image\test.pdf"", FileMode.Open)
        Dim reader As New iTextSharp.text.pdf.PdfReader(x)
        getAllImages(?????, ?????? ,reader)

(NB: GetTransactionScope() gets me the transaction).

But I don't want to involve the logging call in the transaction; the `LogInformation()` call wraps a call to the Enterprise Libraries.

From what I understand I need to use the `Suppress` [TransactionScopeOption][1] to exclude the logging call from the transaction (is that the only / best way)?

Assuming that's the case I'd rather do this inside my helper - otherwise I'm going to have a large SUV's worth of additional TransactionScope code all over the place...  So, is this the best way / acceptable:

    using (var scope = GetTransactionScope())
    {
      ... do stuff
      InfoLogger.LogInformation(""blah blah"", ""Blah blah"", someEventId);
    }

(NB: GetTransactionScope() gets me the transaction).

But I don't want to involve the logging call in the transaction; the `LogInformation()` call wraps a call to the Enterprise Libraries.

From what I understand I need to use the `Suppress` [TransactionScopeOption][1] to exclude the logging call from the transaction (is that the only / best way)?

Assuming that's the case I'd rather do this inside my helper - otherwise I'm going to have a large SUV's worth of additional TransactionScope code all over the place...  So, is this the best way / acceptable:

    public static void LogInformation(string title, string message, int eventId)
    {
        using (TransactionScope scope = new TransactionScope(TransactionScopeOption.Suppress))

Here's my biggest gripes, what's yours ?

1) **Animation quality**. They could be smoother, don't get me wrong animations are nice but they're not of the quality you see with iOS  for instance. I'm not sure if this is because WPF doesn't have support for vsync, making it hard to have those ultra smooth animations

2) **No multithreading in the UI**. I understand the reasoning and I hear there was a model for multithreading in the UI that was scrapped due to complexity/deadlines. The current model however is very limiting IMO. Currently you can't have one animation running and start doing anything else UI intensive without the animation stuttering. Even if re-architecturing WPF to be multithreaded would be beyond their scope they should try and make animations multithreaded somehow. Currently the only way around this is using and layering windows running on different threads, and that gets old fast.

3) **No native WPF  webbrowser control** Sure you can use the windows forms webcontrol but it's not a native WPF control that you can manipulate and the performance is still pretty bad. Compare that with the Chromium browser for WPF which is awesomely fast. Hopefully they'll get around to integrating IE9 properly

4) **Text quality**,  With WPF 4.0 they improved text quality a lot, especially for small text. However I still see many WPF apps with suboptimal textrendering. It's especially noticeably  for medium to large text. I'm not saying it's bad it's not just great either. If they could take text quality with rendering on par with Photoshop (maybe per configuration so you could sacrifice performance for quality where needed )  it would really put WPF over the edge and allow us to build some great looking applications.
 
5) **The template system** This is probably a pet peeve and I totally agree with the design thinking around templating controls. Separating functionality from design is great. However I usually find the way it's currently done is pretty messy and subclassing custom controls to change some aspect and knowing what control to change/modify isn't exactly easy. Perhaps they could make it a bit easier

Right now I'm working on a project that has three layers: UI, BLL, DAL. A Domain library contains all of my interfaces and business entities.

Some may argue that entities adorned with attributes does not matter as it is more metadata, but I don't like this. It doesn't feel right.

Here is the problem. Suppose, I am working on a framework that is going to be packed into an assembly without source code available and shipped as a product. From the very beginning the framework is developed with extensibility in mind, by which I mean that some target domain details/data/classes are to be defined by the end user / assembly that refers the framework. One of the ways to enable it is to use generics in the framework for everything to be defined later. But once a generic is introduced to a single class all dependent/referring classes and methods have to re-declare it with all the exact constraints. It's not a big deal to pass around a single generic, but things go very quickly out of control when you have to deal, say with 8 of them, which is not something uncommon at all. In every little class in your framework you have to put several lines of just redeclared type parameters that are all the same among all of your classes. It seems like a quick and dirty solution would be just to have some kind of c++like macro that would add the same generic declaration to all (most of) classes. But C# doesn't have macros, so you have to do it by hands. Here is where we come to a question: what would it take to get these parameters out of brackets and declare them once at the assembly (project) level? So that you don't have to write ""public class Entity<TField> { ... }"", because TField is defined and whenever you see it, it means the class knows about it implicitly using the same declaration as the one at the assembly level. By linking such generic assemblies a developer has to provide all type arguments before they are able to use it, or if some parameters are still unbound, to redeclare them for later use.

Questions:

  - have you ever found yourself in a situation like this?
  - do you think that having this feature might be helpful?
  - if so, how do you currently get along without one?
  - for those who is working on c#: what is a chance that you guys will add this to some new version of c#?

As far as I know, there are 3 main ways to retrieve a simple list of Team Projects from TFS:

 - Using the new Catalog service (TFS 2010)
 - Using the VersionControlServer (TFS 2008/2010)
 - Using the ICommonStructureService (TFS 2008/2010)

The simple tests I conducted compared the three methods when counting the total number of projects returned.

**Method 1: Catalog Service (TFS 2010 Only)**

        public IEnumerable<string> GetTeamProjectNamesUsingCatalog()
        {
            ReadOnlyCollection<CatalogNode> projectNodes = new TfsTeamProjectCollection(collectionUri).CatalogNode.QueryChildren(
                        new[] { CatalogResourceTypes.TeamProject },
                        false, CatalogQueryOptions.None);

            foreach (var tp in projectNodes)
                yield return tp.Resource.DisplayName;
        }

**Method 2: VersionControlServer**

        public IEnumerable<string> GetTeamProjectNamesUsingVCS()
        {
            TfsTeamProjectCollection tp = new TfsTeamProjectCollection(collectionUri);

            foreach (var p in tp.GetService<VersionControlServer>().GetAllTeamProjects(false))
                yield return p.Name;
        }

**Method 3: ICommonStructureService**

        public IEnumerable<string> GetTeamProjectNamesUsingStructureService()
        {
            var structService = new TfsTeamProjectCollection(collectionUri).GetService<ICommonStructureService>();

            foreach (var p in structService.ListAllProjects())
                yield return p.Name;
        }

The unit tests I ran were super simple. I used the .Count() method to make sure we iterated all the team projects (.Any() is faster as it will stop after the first name is returned).

**Results**

    Test Run 1:
    -----------
    Catalog: 264ms
    VCS: 226ms
    ICSS: 53ms
    
    Test Run 2:

    VCS: 142ms
    ICSS: 43ms

**Findings**

As you can see, it seems like the `ICommonStructureService` is fairly fast at finding all the team projects. *Note: I had done earlier tests using `ICommonStructureService3` (new in TFS 2010 API) and the same code was slower than the other two methods.*

Keep in mind what it is you want to do with the team projects, however. If simply listing them is all you need, the ICSS is probably the way to go. If you want to use the list for navigation, you'll also need the path (`$/TeamProject`) or Uri. In that case, VCS is probably the best way to go as you can use the `ServerItem` property, which holds the path to the item. You might also get away with simple string concatenation using ICSS (`""$/"" + p.Name`).

    worksheet.Controls.AddControl(listView, 0, 0, 100, 100, ""myListView01"");


With this, I am able to make the control smaller by dragging left/upwards.

The problem is that I am not able to make it larger because it won't allow dragging the cursor past the right/bottom border of MyListView.  After doing some investigation, I believe that this is occurring because all controls that get added to the worksheet via VSTO are parented by a control called VSTOContainerControl, who's size is always set to be the same as it's child control.  This fact is confirmed on an MSDN blog [here][1].  I discovered that if I programatically increase the size of the parent VSTOContainerControl, the child MyListView automatically increases as well.  However, I need the ability for the user to manually increase the size at will.  How can I achieve this?

This control gets added to my worksheet:

    MyListView listView = new MyListView();
    Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.Worksheet worksheet = Globals.Factory.GetVstoObject(Globals.ThisAddIn.Application.ActiveWorkbook.Sheets[1]);
    worksheet.Controls.AddControl(listView, 0, 0, 100, 100, ""myListView01"");


With this, I am able to make the control smaller by dragging left/upwards.

The problem is that I am not able to make it larger because it won't allow dragging the cursor past the right/bottom border of MyListView.  After doing some investigation, I believe that this is occurring because all controls that get added to the worksheet via VSTO are parented by a control called VSTOContainerControl, who's size is always set to be the same as it's child control.  This fact is confirmed on an MSDN blog [here][1].  I discovered that if I programatically increase the size of the parent VSTOContainerControl, the child MyListView automatically increases as well.  However, I need the ability for the user to manually increase the size at will.  How can I achieve this?

My particular experience is with NHibernate and Mono, but I see similar cases involving other projects everywhere.

While everyone seems to [claim][1] that NHibernate is working on Mono, I must admit that I actually tried yesterday, and the 3.0 trunk doesn't work. To me, this is a blocking issue, because it prevents me from using NHibernate for my Mono-based projects.  
I had a conversation with the Mono people who directed me to an [old bug report][2] in the NH bug tracker, and [its Mono counterpart][3].

What bothers me most is that neither of the two groups actually wanted to fix the issue. Instead, they just pointed fingers to each other. In the end, it was fixed in NHibernate, but it seems that in 3.0 they re-introduced it again.

Anyways, I wanted to avoid debating about whether NHibernate or Mono is at fault and created a [working patch][4] for NHibernate that fixes the issue.  
Guess what! They **didn't** accept it, saying that Mono is errornous...

The people at Mono say that NHibernate only works on Microsoft.NET because of an undocumented bug. I asked them if they would accept a patch if I fixed this in Mono, but they said **no**, too...

In my opinion, this is simply not right. While they are debating about who's guilty, the ones who s*ck this the most are always the average application developers (like me). Especially when I'm willing to fix the issue myself for free, and I'm also willing to contribute the patch to them, for free. All it would take is two clicks to apply the patch. Despite this, they don't care.

So, what do you guys think about it?  
Should I start looking for a new ORM, or I'm better off using a custom patched version of NHibernate?

A more general question, why do these people have this attitude? It is not helping anyone.

Sometimes you will get a message that looks like this:

> System.ServiceModel.CommunicationException:
> The socket connection was aborted.
> This could be caused by an error
> processing your message or a receive
> timeout being exceeded by the remote

> System.IO.IOException: Unable to read
> data from the transport connection: An

> closed by the remote host.

The problem is that the local socket timeout it's giving you is merely an attempt to be convenient. It may or may not be the cause of the problem. But OK, sometimes networks have issues. No big deal. We can retry or something. But here's the huge problem. On top of failing to tell you which precisely which timeout (if any) resulted in the failure (""your server-side receive timeout was exceeded,"" or something, would be helpful), WCF seems to have two types of timeouts.

***Timeout Type #1)*** A timeout, that, if increased, would increase the chance of your operation's success. So, the pertinent timeout is an hour, you are uploading a huge file that will take an hour and twenty minutes. It fails. You increase the timeout, it succeeds. I have no no problem with this type of timeout.

***Timeout Type #2)*** A timeout which merely defines how long you have to wait for the service to actually fail and give you an error, but modifying the value of this timeout has no impact on the chance of success. Basically, something happens during the first second of the service request which mucks things up. It will never recover. WCF doesn't magically retry the network connection for you. Fine, sometimes establishing a network connection doesn't go well. But, if your timeout is 2 hours, you have to **wait 2 whole hours with no chance of it ever working before it finally acknowledges that it didn't work and gives you the error**.

But the error you see in both cases looks the same. With timeout Type #2, it still looks like you are running into a timeout. But, you could increase all of your timeouts to 4 years, and all it would do is make it take 4 years to get an error message. I know that Type #2 exists because I can do an operation that is known to complete in less than a minute when successful, and have it take 2 hours to fail. But, if I kill it and retry, it succeeds quickly. (If you are wondering why there might be a 2 hour timeout on an operation that takes less than a minute, there are times I run the operation with a much larger file and it could take over an hour.)

So, to combat the problem with Type #2, you'd want your timeout to be really quick so you immediately know if there is a problem. Then you can retry. But the insurmountable problem is that because I don't know which timeouts are the cause of failure, I don't know what timeouts are Type #1 and which ones are Type #2. There may be one timeout (let's say the client-side send timeout) that acts like Type #1 in some cases and Type #2 in others. I have no idea, and I have no way of finding out.

Does anyone know how to track down Type #2 timeouts so I can set them to low values without having to shorten actual (read: Type #1) timeouts and lower the chance of success?

In the following code I have a collection of classes. The class `A` is compared by the **`ID`**, the class `B` - by **`Code`**.

Is `GetHasCode()` overriding sufficient for that kind of comparisons?

The data from the webservice is about 2mb; the bit I want to use is about a third of each record, so this allows me to cache and quickly manipulate it.

I want to be able to sort and filter the results with the least amount of overhead and as fast as possible so I used the VCSKICKS timing class to measure their performance

                  Average        Total (10,000)
    Type       Create  Sort      Create  Sort
    HashSet    0.1579  0.0003    1579    3
    IList      0.0633  0.0002    633     2
    IQueryable 0.0072  0.0432    72      432
*Measured in Seconds using http://www.vcskicks.com/algorithm-performance.php*


I created the hashset through a for loop over the web-service response (adding to the hashset).

The List & IQueryable were created using LINQ.

**Question**
I can understand why HashSet takes longer to create (the foreach loop vs linq); but why would IQueryable take longer to sort than the other two; and finally is there a better way to assign the HashSet.

",.net,c#-3.0,types,type-conversion,,,open,0,2008,8,"Choosing a type for search results in C# I have a result set that will never exceed 500; the results that come back from the web-service are assigned to a search results object.

The data from the webservice is about 2mb; the bit I want to use is about a third of each record, so this allows me to cache and quickly manipulate it.

I want to be able to sort and filter the results with the least amount of overhead and as fast as possible so I used the VCSKICKS timing class to measure their performance

                  Average        Total (10,000)

    IQueryable 0.0072  0.0432    72      432
*Measured in Seconds using http://www.vcskicks.com/algorithm-performance.php*


I created the hashset through a for loop over the web-service response (adding to the hashset).

The List & IQueryable were created using LINQ.

**Question**
I can understand why HashSet takes longer to create (the foreach loop vs linq); but why would IQueryable take longer to sort than the other two; and finally is there a better way to assign the HashSet.

Thanks

Which can be found [HERE][2].

I while some of the differences are obviously related to the differences in the platform etc. There are some that I just wonder why they would be different at all. If anyone has some thoughts or actual concrete information on this, I would be interested to hear your input.

Here are a few of the things that seemed strange, especially the last point in my list, which is what actually prompted me to post this.

 1. **Char.ToLower(Char, CultureInfo)** - On the MAC the current culture is used rather than the specified culture.
 2. **Decimal/Single/UInt16/UInt32/UInt64** - The document states that these types are not supported, is it that the OS does not support them so they are 'emulated' (I use the term 'emulated' loosely since the underlying CPU definitely supports them excluding Decimal of course).
 3. **Double/Single *Infinity properties** - Why have these return different strings on the different platforms. Now I am not saying people should use the string representation for comparisons, that would be silly, but why make them different, isn't that just looking for portability problems?
 4. **CultureInfo Constructor** - On Windows if an invalid culture string is passed to the constructor and ArgumentException is thrown, on the MAC the CultureInfo is initialized as the current culture.

Now none of these are serious differences given that if the code is written according to commonly understood best practices, but I wonder why what I possibly incorrectly consider to be part of a behavior contract (though not explicit in .NET) like the fact that passing an invalid culture string to a constructor does not provide the consistent behavior across platforms.

Im doing well redesigning most of the layers except how to partition the domain properly (I should mention at this point that we are using .Net 4.0).  My original thought was that these were bounded contexts because of the way they were working, they really seemed to have different sets of users, but I believe now the reality is people who use this site may and do use many areas at once.  Sure, some groups ONLY use one service exclusively, but a lot use several.  The goal of the site is one-stop management of ""members"".  Between the modules we have classes unique to the module and then we have some shared classes, for example, the concept of a member is known and used by all modules.  Member is actually a core concept, the site adds value by tracking member's information in all these areas at once.  That's basically it, a few closely related but separate areas in the system and a shared area.  I hope that is clear enough to answer the question I have.

I am thinking I would still have a shared kernel, even if these are not bounded contexts, for the common entities and shared domain interfaces such as a generic repository interface.  Would it be wise to put all the common code (generic repository, core domain model, shared kernel etc) into the same namespace or namespace hierarchy and should I isolate this namespace in it's own assembly?  Likewise, would I then break out each area (""training"", ""Opportunities""...) into their own assemblies or is it better to have them all in one assembly and logically partition them by namespace.  On one hand, it's a bit easier to see the modules physically partitioned, but I am worried about situations where two modules need to work together to solve a problem.  How would they communicate and keep things acyclic (through services in the application layer I am guessing).

Imagine that user called a controller GetDocuments, but he was redirected to FormsAuthentication.LoginUrl.

First of all I'll supply a little background in to what's going on.  There's a login page at default that leads to a menu that allows you to select previous forms in progress or create new forms.  When this occurs it does grabs (either one) it grabs an ID (either from the gridview or creates one) and then populates the form fields on the next page from that information.   It's fairly simple and works just fine locally from the intranet test folder.

However, the problem starts when I try to run it from the internet folder that goes through our ISA server.  We had some problems with it before in that the .axd files that are used for AJAX were being blocked due to a limit in the length of the URL the connection string created.  Generally, after I go for a new form or try to open a previous form, it will throw a ""There is no row at position 0."" error.  Apparently the session variable that holds the ID for the form is blank for some reason.   However, if I refresh with this error on the screen, it will (most of the time) show up just fine as if nothing happened.

I really can't seem to wrap my head around why this would happen.  Since it has to query the database to load the form information (even with a new form, it loads creates the row and loads empty fields) is the routing that has to occur through the internet lagging behind and loading the page before it returns the row information?  I'm really just speculating, but because it's occuring only when going through the external portion, I'm assuming it's a server problem of some sort... but I can't begin to know where to look.

In my MS Unit Test unit test project I'm testing a piece of code which uses a COM dll for some date conversion calculations (this in turn uses some other COM DLLs so in all three COM DLLs are involved).

When running in a normal application/service set-up, I have no problem getting the side-by-side execution to work through use of manifests linking to the COM dlls' assembly identities, but when trying to do the same from my unit test project, I always get failure due to 'class not registered' exceptions.

Now, I've tried this already:

- Embedding the test DLL manifest
- Embedding both the test DLL manifest, the COM dlls manifests + the COM DLLs themselves

But to no avail. So I'm wondering: how could I make the unit test environment aware of the COM linking through the manifests? To me, it seems like the DLL manifest linking isn't quite working (the EXE manifests are working fine), but usually those kinds of thoughts equals doing something wrong ...

I'm usually pretty successful in searching for stuff like this, but on this one, I've had very few hits, and nothing which resembles this, so please, if you have any thoughts or input, do share :) And if elaboration is needed, please let me know.

(I know, that the use of the COM dlls could probably be avoided by some dependency injection the right place, but for now I'd like to explore this case regarding unit testing a side-by-side setup).

I have a class R containing 2 integer elements, say X and Y. I then have two 24 element arrays named A and B where each element contains an instance of class R. I would like to iterate through the arrays to determine how to use R.Y to populate a third array C as follows:

If R.Y at index i of A is larger than R.Y at index i of B then put R from A into index i of C.

If R.Y at index i of B is larger than R.Y at index i of A then put R from B into index i of C.

If R.Y at index i of A is equal to R.Y at index i of B then put either R into index i of C.

It's the third of these conditions that has me perplexed. For example, if indexes 7, 15, and 19 of arrays A and B have R.Y equal to each other, then I want to try each element of both A and B at those indexes in C to determine which one is required based on a CRC check of C. So I could put the following R values into the same index values of C:

A[7], A[15], A[19]

A[7], A[15], B[19]

A[7], B[15], A[19]

A[7], B[15], B[19]

B[7], A[15], A[19]

B[7], A[15], B[19]

B[7], B[15], A[19]

B[7], B[15], B[19]

These 8 combinations come from 2^3 (2 arrays to the power of the number of times R.Y are the same), so if I have 4 indexes in A and B where R.Y are equal, then there would be 16 combinations, 5 indexes = 32 combinations, 6 = 64, etc.

The issue is I'll never know how many times R.Y will be identical in A and B for all the indexes; it could be 0 to 24. So to make a long description short, I need an algorithm to populate C with all the possible R classes from A and B where R.Y are equal in both arrays, iterate through all the possible combinations of C and stop when that first instance of C passes the CRC check.

Sound simple? I hope so. Let me know if you need any further clarification or point me to a thread that has something similar to this already answered. TIA

To be exact, it's a [KryptonHeaderGroup][1]'s ButtonSpec Click event, but it also happens with a plain vanilla `System.Windows.Forms.Button`.

In the click event, the user interface is brought down (there's a label and a cancel button left), and then an expensive LINQ query is built from previous user input, compiled and then executed. There are `Application.DoEvents()` calls in the foreach which actually executes the query (it's LINQ to objects, so it's lazy). This enables the user to press cancel, and after the `DoEvents`, a cancel flag is tested and the foreach is cancelled, and some clean up happens. So far, so good.

However, when I press the Cancel button after the first few results come in (the label shows how many are already there), the whole Click event handler is restarted! After adding some traces, it seems that this happens *before the previous handler returns*. In other words, it happens in one of the `DoEvents` calls. The button is, of course, not pressed again. It does not happen if the button is disabled in the event handler. But since the button is not pressed, it should not fire its Click event again, should it?

I'm baffled. Obviously the workaround is to disable the button, but I'd like to know what may be the actual problem here. Can the event handler be restarted if `DoEvents` is called before the handler finishes? Is calling `DoEvents` not recommended / allowed in event handlers? But then, since everything is an event handler in an event-driven application, you could never call it :)

Additional hints that may be required to answer this question:

- The LINQ query takes a long time initially before supplying first results, i.e. before the first `DoEvents` call is made.
- The LINQ query runs in the GUI thread because it would not make sense to allow the user to access the rest application, because the access will interfere with the underlying API both the GUI and the LINQ query use.
- I know I should load the LINQ query into a separate app domain and execute it there, to be able to unload it. But there will only be few different queries run by a typical user, and the resulting assembly is cached (for the same query string).
- The problem no longer happens if I either have a break point enabled (*sigh* - Heisenberg, anyone?) or if I cancel later during the query.

I appreciate anything that would explain the behaviour, even if it's just speculation :)

I have column in SqlServer that is typed - decimal(18,6).
When I fetch these values, the .net decimals that are created match the precision in the database.  They look like this:

    1.100000
    0.960000
    0.939000
    0.844400
    0.912340

I need to present (ToString) these values according to these rules:

* Non-zeroes are always shown.
* Trailing zeroes on or before the nth decimal place are shown.
* Trailing zeroes after the nth decimal place are not shown.

So, this is what I want when n is 3:

    1.100
    0.960
    0.939
    0.8444
    0.91234

Now, I have written some code that ToString's the decimal - removing all trailing zeroes, and then analyzes the string looking for a decimal point and counts the number of decimal places to see how many trailing zeroes need to be added back on.  **Is there a better way to accomplish this?**

Also, I know I said ToString in the question above... but if I could modify the decimals on their way out of my data-access layer, such that consumers always get decimals with the proper precision, that would be better.  Is it possible to perform this operation on the decimal itself without string manipulation?

And that works great, I get detailed logs of what is hitting the service. But when I tried to use that in a .NET 1.1 site, it gave an error - it does not recognize the <source> tags. So using what I could find while googling, I trimmed it down to:

    		</listeners>
    	</trace>
    </system.diagnostics>

(I added the ""General"" and ""Data"" lines .. because I saw that in the MSDN page for the switches...)

But nothing is written to my log file. The file gets created, but no output. Anyone have any insight on how to get tracing?

(My problem is, a consumer of our web service is getting a ""network error"" - We can see a IIS log entry when they try to access the service, but there's no other indication it gets past the initial IIS hit - no other logs are written.

",.net,debugging,web,service,,06/22/2011 17:19:51,too localized,1,392,7,"Trace a .NET 1.1 Web Service call I'm having an issue trying to find an error with a web service using .NET 1.1. In .NET 2.0/3 I can add a trace section to my web config like:

          <add name=""System.Web.Services.Asmx"" value=""Verbose""  />
        </switches>
      </system.diagnostics>

And that works great, I get detailed logs of what is hitting the service. But when I tried to use that in a .NET 1.1 site, it gave an error - it does not recognize the <source> tags. So using what I could find while googling, I trimmed it down to:


    <system.diagnostics>
    	<switches>
    	  <add name=""General"" value=""4"" />
    	  <add name=""Data"" value=""1"" />

    		</listeners>
    	</trace>
    </system.diagnostics>

(I added the ""General"" and ""Data"" lines .. because I saw that in the MSDN page for the switches...)

But nothing is written to my log file. The file gets created, but no output. Anyone have any insight on how to get tracing?

(My problem is, a consumer of our web service is getting a ""network error"" - We can see a IIS log entry when they try to access the service, but there's no other indication it gets past the initial IIS hit - no other logs are written. We can hit the web service using the discovery page (hitting the .asmx page), and it works fine.)

Thanks.

For example, you have a form to create a new user profile. If a user doesn't fill out a necessary field, the `Label` of that `TextBox`, or `NumericUpDown` or what not, turn red. Somehow, the `Label` has to know which `Control` it belongs to, and vice versa.

What I do right now is search for the correct label by its `.Name` property, which matcher (partly) with the `.Name` property of my text box. That ugly method looks somewhat like this (VB.NET):
    Dim redLabel As Label
    
    For Each txt As Control In Me.Controls
        If (TypeOf txt Is TextBox And txt.Text = """") Or _

            boxesNotFilled.Add(redLabel.Text)

        End If
    Next



I could make a custom control that does the job, but I don't want to if I don't have to (the classic problem of reinventing the wheel).

My standard approach for pages is to create a ""base page"" that extends the System.Web.UI.Page class and then have my pages inherit from this, rather than directly from the Page class.

I now want to expose some of these functions to my web controls (ascx) and web services. I can think of a number of ways to do this, but they seem a little clumsy and I think I'm missing a trick.

Is there an easy way to provide some common functions to both my pages, web services and controls using inheritance, or do I need to wrap these functions in a class that all of them can access?

An example to clarify:

- I have a singleton that handles most functionality for my web application.
- At the start of each request I want to check that the class exists in the web cache and initialise it if not.

Initially this was handled in a page base that the pages all used. Now I need to be able to access my singleton safely from services and controls, with the same checks. I have therefore extracted the checking and initialisation logic into another class, that then each of my base page, control and web service, all instantiate. Even with this model I have the same code repeated in 3 places (each of my base classes for controls, ws and pages), albeit not much code, this seems wrong too!

It works, but it seems clumsy...I look forward to you guys humbling me with your wisdom!
