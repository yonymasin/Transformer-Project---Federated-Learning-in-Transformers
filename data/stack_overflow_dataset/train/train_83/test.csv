That sounds fair. The limits appear not be be reached (user uses 0% of the account and does not send a whole lot of mail, but you never know what massive e-mail campaign do-it-yourself might undertake). So assuming this was a client-related issue, we waited 1-24 hours. In fact, we waited 6 days. But nothing has happened. The account remains suspended and can not be unsuspended by us. As recommended by other threads, I:

- Changed the password of the user
- Tried the 'unlock captcha' option
- Tried logging in normally through webmail and then type the captcha (but it tells me account is disabled without showing a captcha).
