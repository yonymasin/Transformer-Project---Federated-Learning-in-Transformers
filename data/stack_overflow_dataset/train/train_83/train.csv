Two Issues I am having with this. When using the template, Signatures are entered below the code of the html Stationary file I have created. I would like to pick where the signature goes. Is this possible?

Secondly im having issues with background images. I can apply background against the body (but have no control of if it repeats.. it just does!) also A background doesn't appear when applied to a table

- Check the IP address of the email's sending server
- Check the DNS records of the email's sending server
- Verify the sending agent of the email (i.e. web interface, Outlook, Thunderbird, etc)

He's using IMAP because he's checking his email in about 5 different places, (iPhone, iPad, laptop, webmail, etc.) - so switching to POP is not an option. And neither is switching to another provider (too many people to migrate).

I think I'm correct in thinking that it is not possible to split accounts on a single domain across different MX services.

My question is, if I set up a forwarder to push the email from the receiving account to a separate service, and treat that as the incoming mail ""storage"" but send out using the original account - is that going to cause any nasty issues?

Thanks!",1

11441318,07/11/2012 20:53:40,1493883,07/01/2012 05:18:57,1,1,trouble registering new email addresses in dovecot/postfix setup,"I'm trying to add additional email addresses to a dovecot/postfix email server. I'm a complete newb to both.
The original developer used straight text files (instead of a database) for adding all the different email addresses. 
Originally there were only 4 email addresses: nick, administrator, amanda and gail (each @earlychildhoodeducator.com), and I've added all the other ones. So I added an entry for each one in both /etc/dovecot/users.conf as well as /etc/postfix/virtmbx (and I also remembered to create the hashmap version of /etc/postfix/virtmbx (which is virtmbx.db) by using the postmap command). Then I restarted dovecot and postfix, and thought the new email addresses should now exist, right?
But when I use Windows Live to access the emails for one of these new accounts, I'm told my username and password are incorrect. And when I try to send an email to one of these accounts, I'm told the 'entry doesn't exist in the virtual user table' or something. 
Is there another configuration file I should edit, or another command I should run to make these email addresses work?

I have an application that handles requests in a loop. During this loop for each request multiple actions are taken. These actions are sitting inside try / catch / log blocks. 
I am now extending this to notify administrators of severe errors via email. 

This is all very easy, except for 1 thing. We are relying on the client/s to implement their own email delivery redundancy, and I know from experience there will always be 1 client who just has 1 smtp exchange server, and this is bound to go down from time to time. 

So here is the dilemma 

Scenario 1 (don't handle the error during failed send) - when I send an email to admin and smtp is down it will break the app (app will stop running, and additional loops will stop processing, because the error is unhandled) This means that the error reporting which was supposed to be beneficial to the app suddenly becomes the reason why 99/100 requests don't get processed because there was an issue with request 1.

Scenario 2 (handle the exception during failed send) - this means that I surround send code in try/catch/log blocks, great! the application processes all requests 99 of them , except 1, but the admin now has no notification of this 1 error via email because when it tried to send smtp was down, and that error was simply logged to the application log, the admin who doesn't check this log for days (even weeks) at a time now has no way to know that error took place. 

So is there a win/win way to solve this problem or am I always going to be at a loss, and in the mercy of smtp being up. Remember it is out of our scope to manage email server redundancy.

Now this is how what I'm thinking: The user will send the email from home which contains information about which thread he's posting to, his username, the posters username (so we don't cause too much confusion, obviously he won't remember the whole title of the thread), and the body of the reply. We get that information, and automatically post it into the thread. And since we already can implement email notifications, he will get a reply in HIS inbox when the thread is updated. Basically, he will communicate with the post via email. It's a work around to the network restrictions in class. What do you think? Can you help me?

To summarize, I'm wondering why there are messages about bad signatures, and why verifications are coming out 'fail' or 'neutral'. Details follow.

I'm using opendkim-2.0.2+dfsg-0ubuntu1 with postfix 2.7.0-1 (all from apt) on a current Ubuntu 10.04, and I'm getting a bunch of syslog messages like the following:

    opendkim[664]: A522C4E379 s=gamma d=gmail.com SSL error:04077068:rsa routines:RSA_verify:bad signature
    ...
    opendkim[664]: CFB494E4B6 s=salesforce.dkim d=salesforce.com SSL error:04077068:rsa routines:RSA_verify:bad signature
    ...
    opendkim[664]: B78CF4E88C s=081107 d=returnpath.net SSL error:04077068:rsa routines:RSA_verify:bad signature

Example syslog entries for an email from gmail.com, via returnpath.net:

    opendkim[664]: 7B8C44E4BF smtp.corp.returnpath.net [38.109.196.7] not internal
    opendkim[664]: 7B8C44E4BF not authenticated
    opendkim[664]: 7B8C44E4BF s=gamma d=gmail.com SSL error:04077068:rsa routines:RSA_verify:bad signature
    opendkim[664]: 7B8C44E4BF: bad signature data

opendkim outputs 'neutral' on the corresponding email:

    Authentication-Results: destination.com; dkim=neutral
            (verification failed; insecure key) header.i=@gmail.com;
            dkim-adsp=none (insecure policy)
    ...
    DKIM-Signature: v=1; a=rsa-sha256; c=relaxed/relaxed;
            d=gmail.com; s=gamma;
            h=domainkey-signature:received:received:subject:from:content-type
             :x-mailer:message-id:date:to:content-transfer-encoding:mime-version;

Another example, this one from returnpath.net:

    opendkim[664]: B78CF4E88C smtp.corp.returnpath.net [38.109.196.7] not internal
    opendkim[664]: B78CF4E88C not authenticated
    opendkim[664]: B78CF4E88C s=081107 d=returnpath.net SSL error:04077068:rsa routines:RSA_verify:bad signature
    opendkim[664]: B78CF4E88C: bad signature data

opendkim labels the email with 'dkim=fail':

    Authentication-Results: destination.com; dkim=fail
            (verification failed; insecure key) header.i=@returnpath.net;
            dkim-adsp=none (insecure policy)
    ...
    DKIM-Signature: v=1; a=rsa-sha256; c=relaxed/simple; d=returnpath.net;

According to <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5451>:

       fail:  The message was signed and the signature or signatures were
          acceptable to the verifier, but they failed the verification
          test(s).

       neutral:  The message was signed but the signature or signatures
          contained syntax errors or were not otherwise able to be
          processed.  This result SHOULD also be used for other failures not
          covered elsewhere in this list.

Shouldn't both examples above have resulted in 'dkim=neutral', given that both had what opendkim identifies as bad signatures?

Not all messages are getting this treatment. The following email is from gmail.com, directly:

    Nov  3 12:09:47 ip-10-162-226-167 opendkim[664]: E4EB64E884 mail-gx0-f182.google.com [209.85.161.182] not internal
    Nov  3 12:09:47 ip-10-162-226-167 opendkim[664]: E4EB64E884 not authenticated

with the headers:

    Authentication-Results: destination.com; dkim=pass
            (1024-bit key; insecure key) header.i=@gmail.com; dkim-adsp=pass
    ...
    DKIM-Signature: v=1; a=rsa-sha256; c=relaxed/relaxed;
            d=gmail.com; s=gamma;
            h=domainkey-signature:received:mime-version:received:in-reply-to
             :references:from:date:message-id:subject:to:cc:content-type;
            bh=kjBYW2EbN8CtuVV3W79wQAjKhodGJuzRfnDc3abQM88=;

             q598sqlwbGFjN5fCUlXMxLLj/Rv/ND6aSRNC8=

Why is the gmail-via-returnpath email getting a bad signature, when emails directly from gmail are getting verified fine? (The gmail-produced DKIM-Signatures seem formatted identically in both.)

Are there simple ways I can verify independently or manually that the signatures are bad (e.g. on the command line)? Or otherwise gather more information on what precisely is bad about the signatures?

As another data point, I tried [another DKIM implementation](http://hewgill.com/pydkim/), and while it doesn't complain about the signatures being bad (it might just be incapable of doing that), it also fails the gmail-via-returnpath example and the returnpath example, while passing the gmail example.  I'm mainly wondering if there's something I'm misconfiguring either in Postfix or in OpenDKIM that may be causing this mayhem.

",email,postfix,dkim,,,09/04/2011 15:49:06,off topic,1,2799,7,"Debugging OpenDKIM/Postfix ""bad signatures"" and verification failures I've been spending a while on a couple related problems, and I thought I'd turn here for help. To summarize, I'm wondering why there are messages about bad signatures, and why verifications are coming out 'fail' or 'neutral'. Details follow.

I'm using opendkim-2.0.2+dfsg-0ubuntu1 with postfix 2.7.0-1 (all from apt) on a current Ubuntu 10.04, and I'm getting a bunch of syslog messages like the following:

    opendkim[664]: A522C4E379 s=gamma d=gmail.com SSL error:04077068:rsa routines:RSA_verify:bad signature
    ...
    opendkim[664]: CFB494E4B6 s=salesforce.dkim d=salesforce.com SSL error:04077068:rsa routines:RSA_verify:bad signature
    ...
    opendkim[664]: B78CF4E88C s=081107 d=returnpath.net SSL error:04077068:rsa routines:RSA_verify:bad signature

Example syslog entries for an email from gmail.com, via returnpath.net:

    opendkim[664]: 7B8C44E4BF smtp.corp.returnpath.net [38.109.196.7] not internal
    opendkim[664]: 7B8C44E4BF not authenticated
    opendkim[664]: 7B8C44E4BF s=gamma d=gmail.com SSL error:04077068:rsa routines:RSA_verify:bad signature
    opendkim[664]: 7B8C44E4BF: bad signature data

opendkim outputs 'neutral' on the corresponding email:

    Authentication-Results: destination.com; dkim=neutral
            (verification failed; insecure key) header.i=@gmail.com;
            dkim-adsp=none (insecure policy)
    ...
    DKIM-Signature: v=1; a=rsa-sha256; c=relaxed/relaxed;
            d=gmail.com; s=gamma;
            h=domainkey-signature:received:received:subject:from:content-type
             :x-mailer:message-id:date:to:content-transfer-encoding:mime-version;

             lTmrbNU9u/WkdoDBq2XwNcBDXw3h8PWGlVoZw=

Another example, this one from returnpath.net:

    opendkim[664]: B78CF4E88C smtp.corp.returnpath.net [38.109.196.7] not internal
    opendkim[664]: B78CF4E88C not authenticated
    opendkim[664]: B78CF4E88C s=081107 d=returnpath.net SSL error:04077068:rsa routines:RSA_verify:bad signature
    opendkim[664]: B78CF4E88C: bad signature data

opendkim labels the email with 'dkim=fail':

    Authentication-Results: destination.com; dkim=fail
            (verification failed; insecure key) header.i=@returnpath.net;
            dkim-adsp=none (insecure policy)
    ...
    DKIM-Signature: v=1; a=rsa-sha256; c=relaxed/simple; d=returnpath.net;
            s=081107; t=1288879270;

             ngqr+2zrt9f5IEq8YT6a02Tf+pwkh8FQJOrmTTFg=

According to <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5451>:

       fail:  The message was signed and the signature or signatures were
          acceptable to the verifier, but they failed the verification
          test(s).

       neutral:  The message was signed but the signature or signatures
          contained syntax errors or were not otherwise able to be
          processed.  This result SHOULD also be used for other failures not
          covered elsewhere in this list.

Shouldn't both examples above have resulted in 'dkim=neutral', given that both had what opendkim identifies as bad signatures?

Not all messages are getting this treatment. The following email is from gmail.com, directly:

    Nov  3 12:09:47 ip-10-162-226-167 opendkim[664]: E4EB64E884 mail-gx0-f182.google.com [209.85.161.182] not internal
    Nov  3 12:09:47 ip-10-162-226-167 opendkim[664]: E4EB64E884 not authenticated

with the headers:

    Authentication-Results: destination.com; dkim=pass
            (1024-bit key; insecure key) header.i=@gmail.com; dkim-adsp=pass
    ...
    DKIM-Signature: v=1; a=rsa-sha256; c=relaxed/relaxed;
            d=gmail.com; s=gamma;
            h=domainkey-signature:received:mime-version:received:in-reply-to
             :references:from:date:message-id:subject:to:cc:content-type;
            bh=kjBYW2EbN8CtuVV3W79wQAjKhodGJuzRfnDc3abQM88=;

Why is the gmail-via-returnpath email getting a bad signature, when emails directly from gmail are getting verified fine? (The gmail-produced DKIM-Signatures seem formatted identically in both.)

Are there simple ways I can verify independently or manually that the signatures are bad (e.g. on the command line)? Or otherwise gather more information on what precisely is bad about the signatures?

As another data point, I tried [another DKIM implementation](http://hewgill.com/pydkim/), and while it doesn't complain about the signatures being bad (it might just be incapable of doing that), it also fails the gmail-via-returnpath example and the returnpath example, while passing the gmail example.  I'm mainly wondering if there's something I'm misconfiguring either in Postfix or in OpenDKIM that may be causing this mayhem.

Here is my /etc/opendkim.conf:

    # installation. For more advanced options, see opendkim.conf(5) and/or

3. Wiki - I like wikis, but getting people to use them can be hard and no good for instant response. A better place for reference information than directly in emails

Something like Gmail/Gtalk with its searchable archive would be an improvement on what we have, but I don't know how this could integrate with 'standards' like Outlook.
