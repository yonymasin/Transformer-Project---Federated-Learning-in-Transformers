I love the dynamic workspaces, but I love having at least 4 available as well as dynamically adding more if need be.

I created a patch for myself that adds a minimum of X workspaces and does not break the dynamic desktop feature, and thought that maybe someone else may like it.

I know it sucks to patch gnome-shell itself, and it may be better to make this thing an extension, but I have almost no javascript experience and even less gnome3 development experience. This is ok for my needs.

This patch may stop working if gnome-shell updates, and enough changes are made to make the patch get rejected. If you wish to try it out, make sure you backup everything before applying the patch. If something goes wrong, you can restore the file and have a working desktop again.

I deleted some allow and deny rules and added http_access allow all so that all the request would be allowed.

After configuring my computer, I got this error:


    Access control configuration prevents your request from being allowed at this time. Please contact your service provider if you feel this is incorrect.

And the log in the server showed that my TCP requests had all been denied.

So, first of all, is what I am trying to do achievable? If so, how to configure the squid in the server so that I use it as a proxy to surf the Internet?

My computer and the server both run Ubuntu11.04. 

And server IP:10.1.242.26 my IP:10.1.232.23

I need to convert file *.3gp to PCM *.wav. I'm using for that ffmpeg program. 

When it's installed from repository by using aptitude install ffmpeg it's installing some basic version of it and I cannot convert what I need. 

I've read some stuff on the Internet and I've made what there was written. 
I've installed the latest yasm ver.1.1.0 and the newest x264 - 0.125.2208. After that I got ffmpeg using git from http://ffmpeg.org/download.html (git clone git://source.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.git ffmpeg).

I`ve tried to configure ffmpeg by myself using:

    ./configure --enable-gpl --enable-version3 --enable-postproc

    --enable-libx264 --enable-libopencore-amrnb --enable-libopencore-amrwb

than: time make && make install.

Till this time everything was ok. After conversion (ffmpeg -i audiotest.3gp -f s16le -ar 8000 -acodec pcm_s16le audio.wav) I wanted to check information about this PCM *.wav file (ffmpeg -i audio.wav) and I`ve got this error:

",ubuntu,ffmpeg,3gp,,,07/31/2012 03:57:55,off topic,1,1746,12,"How to configure ffmpeg on ubuntu to convert *.3gp to pcm *.wav I'm using linux Ubuntu ver 10.04.
I need to convert file *.3gp to PCM *.wav. I'm using for that ffmpeg program. 

When it's installed from repository by using aptitude install ffmpeg it's installing some basic version of it and I cannot convert what I need. 

I've read some stuff on the Internet and I've made what there was written. 
I've installed the latest yasm ver.1.1.0 and the newest x264 - 0.125.2208. After that I got ffmpeg using git from http://ffmpeg.org/download.html (git clone git://source.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.git ffmpeg).

I`ve tried to configure ffmpeg by myself using:

    ./configure --enable-gpl --enable-version3 --enable-postproc 
    --enable-nonfree --enable-swscale --enable-pthreads --enable-libmp3lame 
    --enable-libx264 --enable-libopencore-amrnb --enable-libopencore-amrwb

than: time make && make install.

Till this time everything was ok. After conversion (ffmpeg -i audiotest.3gp -f s16le -ar 8000 -acodec pcm_s16le audio.wav) I wanted to check information about this PCM *.wav file (ffmpeg -i audio.wav) and I`ve got this error:

I am having a whole host of issues with redis esp when using chef.  I am using chef on ubuntu 64. I do not want redis as a service but would like a pid.  One is not created.  So..below are my issues.  I am using the lastest version of redis 2.4.10

    /etc/init.d/redis_6379: 1: -e: not found

    sudo killall -9 redis-server


3) When starting redis server...well...it starts but the command line just hangs. But redis is started though.  This    messes up my chef install.  Chef never finishes.

    sudo /etc/init.d/redis_6379 start
    /etc/init.d/redis_6379: 1: -e: not found
    Starting Redis server...

 
Chef command to restart Redis

    execute ""restart_redis"" do
      command ""/etc/init.d/redis_6379 stop; /etc/init.d/redis_6379 start""
      action :nothing
    end

    sudo killall -9 redis-server


3) When starting redis server...well...it starts but the command line just hangs. But redis is started though.  This    messes up my chef install.  Chef never finishes.

    sudo /etc/init.d/redis_6379 start
    /etc/init.d/redis_6379: 1: -e: not found
    Starting Redis server...

 
Chef command to restart Redis

    execute ""restart_redis"" do
      command ""/etc/init.d/redis_6379 stop; /etc/init.d/redis_6379 start""
      action :nothing
    end

So...below...great run still I have to restart redis.....

I Have some questions about the following Command in Hadoop (as I am new to Linux/Ubuntu): 

       bin/hadoop dfs -copyFromLocal /tmp/folder /user/hduser/folder
This copies the files from the local file system to HDFS; would it be possible to access the HDFS from Ubuntu's GUI? without using ""-ls"" in shell? like in, I want to open the folder where the HDFS files are located in...Would this be possible?

Thank you",2

    start-stop-daemon --start --exec /home/ubuntu/programs/play/current/play 
                      --chuid ubuntu:ubuntu -- start /home/ubuntu/myapp/src/ --%id

Play starts up ok, but it then fails to create the log4j file. I believe `start-stop-daemon` does not correctly sets the folder for log4j. Log4j is configured to create a log file at relative path `logs/play.log`, which translates to `/home/ubuntu/myapp/logs/play.log`. The folder `/home/ubuntu/myapp/logs/` does exist, but I get this error when Play starts:

> log4j:ERROR setFile(null,true) call failed.

Meaning that the ""current directory"" for Play is not the play home dir, but rather something else. Now, I can change it by providing an absolute log4j path, but it seems like a hack, and I wonder if other components that rely on the Play current folder will exhibit similar problems.

So, how I can ensure Play's current directory is identical to the app's homedir?

My Ubuntu 12.04 server and a WinXP personal computer are sit behind a home router (using the network 192.168.1.0/24) which connects to the Internet. I have also setup a remote computer to connect to the Ubuntu 12.04 server through VPN using the network 10.0.0.0/8. 

As a newbie in using Squid, I want to know how to make changes to the Squid 3.1 default config file so that the VPN remote computer (i.e. 10.0.0.0/8 network) could browse the Internet through the Squid http proxy installed in the Ubuntu 12.04 server. Or has the default Squid configuration handled this for me and I do not have to make any change ? Moreover, in the home router, do I need further setup other than redirecting TCP/UDP port 3128 (the default Squid proxy port) traffic to the Ubuntu server through NAT ?

In the VPN remote computer, I am using firefox. If my Ubuntu server has a network address of 10.0.0.3/8 in the VPN network, should I just fill in ""HTTP proxy""=10.0.0.3 and ""Port""=3128 in the ""Manual proxy configuration"" section of the firefox preference ?

What's with the hardware change? If it has 2, how can i make the AR9285 always load and disable AR5008, or, is it the same and it's just showing it different? :|

Thanks in advanced.",ubuntu,wireless,,,,03/24/2012 17:40:34,off topic,1,637,4,"Ubuntu + Atheros Wireless Hi I've been fighting these wireless drivers for a few days and just recently i noticed that the model the Wireless controller appears in lspci is different sometimes. This is the data i have after installing Ubuntu Server 64 bit

> ~# lspci -k
....
>

	Subsystem: AzureWave Device 1d89
	Kernel driver in use: ath9k
	Kernel modules: ath9k

ran some updates, restarted, all was good, all though it did say that linux-headers-server linux-image-server linux-server where beeing kept back.

After that i installed ubuntu-desktop (aptitude install ubuntu-desktop --without-recommends) restarted and not only is the wireless not working anymore, but the hardware is listed as a different card

> ~# lspci -k

....

> 04:00.0 Ethernet controller: Atheros Communications Inc. AR5008 Wireless Network Adapter (rev 01)

has no available drivers for it, still i tried to modprobe ath9k, they show up in lsmod as loaded, but still iw list shows nothing.

this is what it looked like before the ubuntu-desktop instalation
