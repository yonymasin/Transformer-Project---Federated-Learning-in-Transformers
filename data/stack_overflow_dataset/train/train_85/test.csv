What I've noticed however, is that this only works if I *first* start my tornado server, then invoke the above command. If I invoke this command first, and then try to start my server, Python tells me the address is in use. Once this happens, I can't seem to get the port back. For example, if I then invoke the iptables comand above for port 22001, and 'sudo iptables -t nat -L -n -v' gives me:

Chain PREROUTING (policy ACCEPT 6 packets, 384 bytes)
 pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination         
    6   376 REDIRECT   tcp  --  eth0   *       0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0           tcp dpt:80 redir ports 22001 

And I then try to start another Python sever on port 22000, Python still tells me the port is in use, even after a '/sbin/iptables -F'. What am I doing wrong here?

I don't need to use Dynagen because I'm not running a lab of emulated routers on a single machine... I'm simply using one machine to run one instance of a router for a larger experiment.

I can start the single instance of Dynamips without using Dynagen by executing the following command:

I am no long time user; I have been using GNU/Linux for 2 years only. I used **Slackware** for the first year and **Arch Linux** for the second, both obviously having their pro's and cons.

I know Slackware offers *sbopkg*, but **Arch Linux**'s *pacman* was just marvelous.
I liked **Arch Linux** so well that I thought I had found ""my"" distro. As the second year passed, I grew kind of tired of the system instability (nothing else can be expected, I know) from a bleeding-edge package management system in a rolling release distro. At this point I really started missing **Slackware**'s stability.

So just today, I peeked at this **Ubuntu** I have been hearing about. I was, frankly, a bit horrified, as I tried to make myself consider using it permanently. In regards to where I came from (**Slack** / **Arch**), **Ubuntu** felt very bloated, sluggish and, well, more about show than effect. I have been hearing a great variety of opinions regarding *Unity*, but I have absolutely no knowledge about Ubuntu, so I need your help.

I do not care for visual candy, but the WM / DE *must* support Java applications well, as this is what I will be programming for the coming years.

**TL;DR - I seek a distribution which is stable, but still supports modern hardware and packages.**

I *REALLY* value lightweight, customizable solutions (I cannot stress this enough. I felt like I was in a cage while using Ubuntu(Unity).

Am I asking too much? If not - what are your suggestions? 

Thanks a lot in advance,

As the title states, I am searching for a distribution that can prove reliable, but still not too conservative, in terms of hardware-support, modern packages, and such.

I am no long time user; I have been using GNU/Linux for 2 years only. I used **Slackware** for the first year and **Arch Linux** for the second, both obviously having their pro's and cons.

I know Slackware offers *sbopkg*, but **Arch Linux**'s *pacman* was just marvelous.
I liked **Arch Linux** so well that I thought I had found ""my"" distro. As the second year passed, I grew kind of tired of the system instability (nothing else can be expected, I know) from a bleeding-edge package management system in a rolling release distro. At this point I really started missing **Slackware**'s stability.

So just today, I peeked at this **Ubuntu** I have been hearing about. I was, frankly, a bit horrified, as I tried to make myself consider using it permanently. In regards to where I came from (**Slack** / **Arch**), **Ubuntu** felt very bloated, sluggish and, well, more about show than effect. I have been hearing a great variety of opinions regarding *Unity*, but I have absolutely no knowledge about Ubuntu, so I need your help.

I do not care for visual candy, but the WM / DE *must* support Java applications well, as this is what I will be programming for the coming years.

**TL;DR - I seek a distribution which is stable, but still supports modern hardware and packages.**

I *REALLY* value lightweight, customizable solutions (I cannot stress this enough. I felt like I was in a cage while using Ubuntu(Unity).

Am I asking too much? If not - what are your suggestions?

My purpose is:

1. To set up a local mail server which will fetch mails from an external server in deliver the same to the local clients like outlook
2. The mails sent through the outlook clients to other recipients would be forwarded to them, not directly, but through this local server.

For example, there are 5 users having account in **gmail.com**: **user1@gmail.com, 
user2@gmail.com, user3@gmail.com, user4@gmail.com, user5@gmail.com**. Now, my purpose is to fetch those mails into **my-local server** so that users get access to them. Also, their sent mails would be collected in this mail server, and forwarded to gmail for forwarding (The clients would be configured so).
