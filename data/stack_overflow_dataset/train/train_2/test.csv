The problem that I'm having is that the content below the message isn't sliding elegantly, it's ""jumping"" to the full height of the message before the animation has even started.  The same is true for when the message gets hidden - the message slides up, but the height stays the same until the animation has completed and then the content pops back into place.

Super simplified JSFiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/U94qD/2/

Code (in case JSFiddle is down):

HTML:

    <div class=""slide"" style=""display:none;"">Sliding Something into place</div>
    <div>This is always shown, but jumps down when the slide animation starts instead of sliding down with the element as it's displayed and it stays in place as the div above hides instead of sliding smoothly with it.</div>

JS: 

    setTimeout(function() {
        show();
    }, 500);
    
    function show() {
        $("".slide"").show('slide', {
            direction: 'up'
        }, 1000, function() {
            hide();
        });
    }
    
    function hide() {
        setTimeout(function() {
            $("".slide"").hide('slide', {
                direction: 'up'
            }, 1000);
        });

**NOTE:** I have tried using the ""slideDown"" and ""slideUp"" methods instead, but the animation doesn't function the same.  Instead of sliding the content down, the height of the div is adjusted to reveal the content, which is what I would call a ""blind"" animation, not a ""slide""",jquery,jquery-ui,jquery-effects,jquery-slide-effects,,,open,0,354,13,"jQuery UI show using slide animation jumps to full height before animation starts I am trying to create a simple message that slides in and ""elegantly"" slides the content below it down while it slides in.  The problem that I'm having is that the content below the message isn't sliding elegantly, it's ""jumping"" to the full height of the message before the animation has even started.  The same is true for when the message gets hidden - the message slides up, but the height stays the same until the animation has completed and then the content pops back into place.

Super simplified JSFiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/U94qD/2/

Code (in case JSFiddle is down):

HTML:

    <div class=""slide"" style=""display:none;"">Sliding Something into place</div>
    <div>This is always shown, but jumps down when the slide animation starts instead of sliding down with the element as it's displayed and it stays in place as the div above hides instead of sliding smoothly with it.</div>

JS: 

    setTimeout(function() {
        show();
    }, 500);
    
    function show() {
        $("".slide"").show('slide', {

http://www.carbondelight.co.uk./home.php

I have 6 images/products on an infinite loop powered by the BxSlider (http://bxslider.com/), that bit is simple.

I have then coded in jQuery a function that displays the products name when you hover over the respective product image.

The problem I'm having is that the hovering only works on each loop and does not cross over to the next loop. For example if you take a look at the page mentioned earlier you'll notice that the last image in the loop is two back seats of a red car, and if you try and hover between that image and the boat image next to it you will get no change in the product name. But if you move completley into the next loop all of the jQuery works again. And for the life of me I cannot solve this issue. Does anyone have any ideas?

The first dialog box I change the title of the box with using the following `.attr(""title"", ""Confirm"")` -- it change the title of the first box to 'Confirm', like it should have. Now when the second box pops up it should change the title to 'Message' since did the same thing for the second box -- `.attr(""title"", ""Message"")`. Right? But it doesnt. It keep the title from before. However, the message change like it should have. I have tested in IE8, Chrome, and FF3.6.

How can I solve that the image is already loaded when the page is shown?

What I also tried is to hide the ""#page-start"" (with style=""display:none"" initially) and performed on javascript:

    $(document).bind('pageinit', function() {
        $(""#page-start"").show();
    });

but it didn't solve my problem, the page is displayed directly and the image takes 2,3,4 seconds until it's shown up and the page jumps down a bit (exatly the image height).

Thanks in advance.

I am using jQuery to grab a populated form (for editing content) using ajax.  This form has a textarea that I am replacing with CKEditor.

I have a div with a gradient from white to gray. In this div there is a image with a outerglow (css). This image needs his right top corner 'cut off' with an angle of 45 degr.

Not a big issue one might think. Put a transparant image with a colored corner over it, or use css3. But the problem is the gradient. At the bottom there's the gray color. If you use the image with a colored corner, the colors won't match anymore. I can't use the css3 border radius because of IE/older browsers.

Is there a way to 'physically' cut off the corner with jQuery? The website is in ASP.NET C# so csharp solution would also work.

    <div id=""UniqueID"" class=""request"">
    <div class=""request_main""></div> //VISIBLE
    <div class=""request_info""></div> //HIDDEN
    </div>

On clicking a div, the jQuery click listener handles a click on a ""request_main"" element and searches the parent div for the ""request_info"" div. It then shows the ""request_info"" div if it's not already visible. 

    $("".request_main"").live('click', function(){
		
	$("".nrl"").removeClass('blue').addClass('grey');
					
	if($(this).parent().find("".request_info"").css('display') == 'none'){
				
	$("".request_info"").hide();
				
	$(this).parent().find("".request_info"").stop(false,true).show(""slide"",   {direction:""up""},300,function(){});

	$("".links"").removeClass('white').addClass('grey');

	$(this).find("".links"").removeClass('grey').addClass('white');
	$(this).find("".links"").css('background-color','#1B75BB');
						
	}			
    });

In firefox, safari, chrome and even IE9 this works fine. In IE8 however, the function works only on divs that haven't been clicked before e.g. Click on ""UniqueID_1"" -> ""request_info"" displays.

I'm stuck.",jquery,div,internet-explorer-8,show-hide,,,open,0,202,10,"jQuery div click post hide not working properly in IE8 I have a list of divs created with javascript on the page that have the format:
        
    <div id=""UniqueID"" class=""request"">
    <div class=""request_main""></div> //VISIBLE
    <div class=""request_info""></div> //HIDDEN
    </div>

On clicking a div, the jQuery click listener handles a click on a ""request_main"" element and searches the parent div for the ""request_info"" div. It then shows the ""request_info"" div if it's not already visible. 

    $("".request_main"").live('click', function(){
		
	$("".nrl"").removeClass('blue').addClass('grey');

I have the page set up so when a thumb is clicked the Jquery UI contents is replaced with Jquery UI contents from another page.  The sliders work fine when the page first loads, but when you load the external content in the sliders don't show up at all.  Any ideas on why this is happening?

http://www.klossal.com/portfolio/example.html  click the thumb at the top to prompt the contents to replace what's there.

Sorry there's no fiddle, the elements wouldn't work correctly, but here is the code, or you can look it up on the page.

http://www.klossal.com/portfolio/example.html  is what gets loaded into example.html, it's exactly the same as the html from example.html, and there is not scripts with it, just the html code because the scripts are in the page it's getting loaded into.

I'd really appreciate any help I can get with this, I just can't figure it out.

4) domain2 has ShadowBox installed in the HTML too

The issue is basically down to crosssite scripting:

The swf embedded on domain2 fires domain2 ShadowBox to open this popup, but the javascript call in the Flash is from domain1 which causes crossdomain permissions problems.

I created a simple example here: [http://jsfiddle.net/wDKPN/][1]

Notice if you include 1.4.4 the .change() function will **not** fire when the .click() event is triggered.  But when switching to 1.6, the .change() event **is** fired when .click() is triggered.

Two questions:

 1. **Is this a bug?**  It seems that programmatically triggering .click() *shouldn't* also fire other events (for example, it would seem wrong to also automatically fire .blur() and .focus(), to help ""mimic"" a user's click).

 2. **What is the proper way for me to bind a change() event *and then* trigger *both* a click() and change() event for that element?**  Do I simply call .click(), and rely on the fact that .change() will also fire?

        $('#myelement').change(function() {
             // do some stuff
        });

        $('#myelement').click(); // both click and change will fire, yay!

In my old code I'm using this pattern to initialize some checkboxes (and their checked states and values) after an ajax call:

        $('#myelement').change(function() {
             // do some stuff including ajax work
        }).click().change();

But in 1.6.1 my logic fires twice (once for .click() and once for .change()).  Can I rely on just removing the .change() trigger and hope that jQuery continues to behave this way in future versions?

Thanks for any feedback!

I'm working on a rather complicated site.  We have an update panel that contains some controls.  When one of the controls is clicked, a jQuery dialog box opens. 

When the dialog box closes, I want to signal the update panel to change its display.  To do that I need to post back to the update panel.  

I know the dialog box has a handy callback event that you can hook up to.  But here's the thing.  The javascript that manipulates the dialog is all in a separate .js file.  I want to continue keeping it separate.  So the code that does the postback has either be in that .js file, or injected as a parameter into some method in the .js file.

        $.get( url, function(){});
    }

On the server (PHP) I record the value of the request uri `($_SERVER[""REQUEST_URI""])` and I see a difference between what FF/Chrome send up versus what IE sends up.

Chrome and FireFox cause the value of `($_SERVER[""REQUEST_URI""])` to be 

> /test/Beyonc%C3%A9/

but requests from IE 8 show the value of `($_SERVER[""REQUEST_URI""])` to be 

> /test/Beyonc\xe9

This is causing my dispatcher's regular expression handler to not match correctly on the server.

Any ideas what the root issue here is, and how I can fix it for IE?

Thanks!",4

Any help is greatly appreciated, thank you very much in advance! If you check the source you can check the jQuerydocuments, their at the top of the document.

 - As soon as the modal dialog appears, the link within it is automatically focused, so there is a blue box around it (just like with any element onto which I am focused), but I don't want this behavior.
 - Also, there is an X button to allow the user to close the dialog, and I want to get rid of it.

Whenever you want to navigate to a new page, you simply make the following call:

    $.address.value([some url])

Our app has a very detailed user management system that allows our users to define which users have access to which functions in the app.  We decorate each action method with a customized Authorize attribute that determines whether or not the user has permission to use the function supplied by that action method.  The authorization works great but the problem is that if the user doesn't have permission to utilize the given action method, the browser url still reflects as if they are on the page of the link they clicked.

For instance, if the url /SomeController/UnpermittedAction represents an action method that the user should not be able to utilize, when they click on the link to that method, we execute the following

    $.address.value('/SomeController/UnpermittedAction')

Then, the action returns an Unauthorized response and we display to the user that they are not permitted to utilize that function.  But, understandably, the user's browser window now shows:

    somedomain.com/#/SomeController/UnpermittedAction

That in of itself isn't really a problem, the problem is that if the user goes to some other page and then clicks the back browser button, they see the unauthorized message again and it appears somewhat confusing as they aren't sure why they are seeing that message.

Basically, what I want to achieve is a simple horizontal dropdown menu with JQuery's hover (in Drupal's DHTML menu module). However, there are some annoyances that I could not fix.

So the main menu and their child `<li>`s are all links. When I click one of the child menu, everything is fine (I got directed to the destination, menu resets to normal unhovered state). But when I click the parent menu, after arriving at the destination, even though the dropdown menu resets back the mouse is still hovering above the link. This results in the dropdown being activated briefly again as I move my mouse away.

What I want is that the dropdown activates only when the mouse enters the element, not when it exits. I've tried separating `.hover()` into `.mouseenter()` and `.mouseleave()`, but this instead results in the dropdown not working at all. Help!

I have some divs inside a tab panel div which is set to display.

One div '**mainpic**' holds an img. The second '**mainpicblurb**' holds text and links inside a sub-div '**piclinks**'. Div '**altpic**' is empty and hidden (display:none) but otherwise an exact copy of 'mainpic'.

I am trying to write a script which does the following:

 1. hides 'mainpic'
 2. grabs href (img src) and adds it as img src to 'altpic'
 3. shows 'altpic'

Here's what I have done.

    $(document).ready(function() {
		$('#piclinks div a').click(function() {
			var link = $(this).attr('href');
			$('#mainpic').hide();
			$('#altpic img').replaceWith('<img align=""middle"" src=""' + link + '"">');
			$('#altpic').show();
		return false;
		});	
	});

This does not work overall. The href is successfully grabbed. The img src is successfully dumped into 'altpic' and 'return false' works ok, but neither 'mainpic' or 'altpic' have the right display attribute. 

It may be that the tabs CSS is overriding whatever I do, although looking at it in Firebug I can't see how.

It's perfectly possible the above is a long string of howlers. My gut instinct is that the selection process is wrong. I need to traverse the DOM from #piclinks div a back up the tree to gather in #mainpic and #altpic, using parent() and siblings(), possibly. 

Anyway, suggestions/understanding criticism welcome.

I need the child items to be sortable as well as droppable onto other items, and I need the parent items to also be sortable (but not droppable on each other or on child items.) I've ALMOST got this working correctly. Originally, I used Sortables for the parents and Draggable/Droppable for the children, but that didn't let me sort the children. I'm now using the common nested sortable setup where the sortable is connected to itself. This works okay for the children, but when I try to sort the parents, the DOM starts... well check out the fiddle below to see for yourself :)

http://jsfiddle.net/nVk8G/5/

I've tried setting a toleranceElement, though I've only just discovered that exists so I don't think I'm using it right. I've looked at Manuele Sarfatti's [nestedSortable][1] plugin, which is awesome, but unfortunately doesn't work with the markup I have. I'm fairly convinced that the markup is the problem, but as you can probably guess, I can't change that.

One thing I didn't include in the fiddle above is the code I have in the `receive` event, which checks to see if the dragged item is a parent and is being dropped on a parent, in which case I call `.sortable(""cancel"")` to stop the item from being placed under another parent. This event is only supposed to be called when a connection between lists is called.

Any and all advice is appreciated! I've read through nearly all the questions on here relating to jQuery UI nested sortables without finding an answer. Nested sortables seem to be one of those things that work great if conditions are just right, but cause huge headaches otherwise.

One last thing, I've applied the patch [here][2] to correct some jumpy behavior with nested sortables. You can't see that on the jsfiddle link though, obviously.

However, I would also like for the table (of database content) to be automatically filtered as I enter the search string. How do I go about this? Please keep in mind when answering that the solution has to fit the ASP.NET MVC 3 framework (and that I'm new to web development).",4

I'm very comfortable with the framework I have been doing it for a 1.5 years and I have been able to do anything I need with the framework.  The rich UI components seem better than jQuery's
Cons:
Custom stylings with sprites and such aren't very nice in 3.3.  It seems like 4.0 will handle most of these things but who knows when it will be released.

jQuery

Pros: 
Better styling.  I noticed a couple of plugins that ExtJS doesn't have that I would like to use.  Once I learn the language having ExtJS/jQuery knowledge will be a plus.
Cons:
I don't know the language and the syntax looks funky :)

Any advice on switching frameworks will help.  My only technical question on jQuery vs ExtJS is how their data/ajax utilities compare to each other.  Thanks in advance and **please no framework bashing.**

    	Name: jQuery iPhone Plugin
    	Release: 0.1.2
    	Date: 2008-04-21 15:20:45
    
    	About jQuery iPhone Plugin
    	--------------------------
    
    		jQuery is a lightweight JavaScript library that emphasizes interaction between JavaScript and HTML, allowing you to easily include many components that enrich and benefit the developer's coding experience.
    
    		jQuery iPhone Plugin extends jQuery's functionality for specific iPhone usages.
    
    		Further documentation for jQuery can be found at: http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:How_jQuery_Works
    
    		Javascript Example of jQuery:
    			$(document).ready(
    				function(){
    					$('body').html('<p>The entire site body was replaced with this text before you even saw it!</p>');
    				}
    			);
    
    
    	Object: version
    	---------------
    
    		version allows you to detect the current version of Safari and Webkit currently installed on the iPhone.
    
    		If no version of safari or webkit is present, either will return false.
    
    		Javascript Example of version:
    			$(document).iPhone.orientchange(
    				alert('Your current version of safari is: ' + $.iPhone.version.safari);
    				alert('Your current version of webkit is: ' + $.iPhone.version.webkit);
    			);
    
    
    	Function: orientchange
    	----------------------
    
    		orientchange allows you to write javascript that is to be executed when the user rotates their iPhone display.
    
    		By default one function is passed and this function will execute on any iPhone rotation.
    
    		Javascript Example of orientchange:
    			$(document).iPhone.orientchange(
    				function(){
    					alert('the iphone has rotated the screen');
    				}
    			);
    
    		By passing in a second function, separated by a comma, you can now specify separate functions for portrait and landscape rotations.
    
    		Javascript Example of orientchange (two arguments):
    			$(document).iPhone.orientchange(
    				function(){
    					alert('the iphone has rotated the screen to portrait');
    				},
    				function(){
    					alert('the iphone has rotated the screen to landscape');
    				}
    			);
    
    		By passing in a third function, separated by a comma, you can now specify separate functions for portrait, 90 degree landscape, and -90 degree landscape rotations.
    
    		Javascript Example of orientchange (three arguments):
    			$(document).iPhone.orientchange(
    				function() {
    					alert('the iphone has rotated the screen to portrait');
    				},
    				function() {
    					alert('the iphone has rotated the screen to a 90 degree landscape');
    				},
    				function() {
    					alert('the iphone has rotated the screen to a -90 degree landscape');
    				}
    			);
    
    
    	Function: hideURLbar
    	--------------------
    
    		hideURLbar allows you to tuck the URL bar above the visibile portion of the screen if the URL bar is currently visible.
    	
    		By default hideURLbar will check to see if the position of the page would already indicate that the address bar was hidden.
    
    		Javascript Example of hideURLbar:
    			$(document).ready(
    				function(){
    					$.iPhone.hideURLbar(); // This will hide the URL bar when the page first appears.
    				}
    			);
    
    		By passing an argument into hideURLbar you can now force it to shift the user to the top of the document where the URL bar is still hidden.
    
    		HTML Example of hideURLbar:
    			<!-- TAKES USER TO THE TOP OF THE PAGE WITHOUT SHOWING THE ADDRESS BAR -->
    			<a href=""javascript:$.iPhone.hideURLbar(1);"">Back to top</a>
    
    
    	Function: disableTextSizeAdjust
    	-------------------------------
    
    		disableTextSizeAdjust allows you to keep the iPhone from automatically resizing text on your page.
    
    		Javascript Example of disableTextSizeAdjust:
    			$(document).ready(
    				function(){
    					$.iPhone.disableTextSizeAdjust();
    				}
    			);
    
    		If the function is excuted after the page has loaded, the text may resize itself to it's originally intended size, where it will then cease resizing.
    
    		HTML Example of disableTextSizeAdjust:
    			<a href=""javascript:$.iPhone.disableTextSizeAdjust();""></a>
    
    
    	Function: enableTextSizeAdjust
    	--------------------
    
    		enableTextSizeAdjust allows you to specify or reenable the iPhone to automatically resize text on your page.
    
    		Javascript Example of enableTextSizeAdjust:
    			$(document).ready(
    				function(){
    					$.iPhone.enableTextSizeAdjust();
    				}
    			);
    
    		If the function is excuted after the page has loaded and text resizing has been previously disabled, the text may resize itself to it's newly desired size, where it will then continue to resize.
    
    		HTML Example of enableTextSizeAdjust:
    			<a href=""javascript:$.iPhone.enableTextSizeAdjust();""></a>

Have tried to create a JSFiddle to illustrate ([Fiddle Link][1]), but it seems that JSFiddle does not support secondary navigation panes, as no matter how much I expand the width it simply renders as continuous page content..

    </html>",jquery,html,,,,,open,0,1973,12,"My html page is showing html elements during rendering of the page I have some pages with tabs. Whenever I click on these tabs, the html takes somes time to be rendered. Take a look at this video I uploaded to understand what I mean: http://screencast.com/t/9cgWWAQD2Qff 

As you can see on this video, when a tab is clicked, we see links in blue for about 0.5 secs.I would like to avoid to see it.

Is there a way to only show rendered html when everything is ready on the page? Or something similar?

I am using JQuery UI. I have an `<input id=""#myfield"" type=""text"">` field and I call `$('#myfield').datepicker()`. The datepicker shows whenever the field gets focus. But the field is the first one in my form and is already in focus when it loads, so clicking on the field doesn't show it. Also, if I close the datepicker with the Esc key, then I can't open it again by clicking on the field, for the same reason: it's already in focus.

I am aware that I could set the parameter `.datepicker({showOn: 'button'})` but I don't want the button. Is there any way to have the datepicker appear when the field gets focus OR is clicked when already in focus? I already tried `$('#myfield').click( function () { $(this).focus() } )` and it makes the datepicker open correctly when I click the input field, but then when I select a date it doesn't appear in the field.",jquery,jquery-ui,focus,datepicker,onfocus,,open,0,171,8,"Show JQuery UI datepicker on input field click?

The current action is you can drag the smaller box to the edge, the code in drag event will stop it from going over the edge, but the drag event is still firing on the smaller box. Only when the mouse button is lifted, and then you can drag the big box...

I used the jquery draggable and droppable libraries to implement on the html-side, but when I pulled it up on the webview, it didn't work. After searching the forums, I tried several fixes and none of them worked. I think that this post could be the answer, but it also didn't work out: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5186441/javascript-drag-and-drop-for-touch-devices. Although, I don't think I implemented it properly, since I just added it on to the code which uses the draggable/droppable from jquery.ui. 

  
Here's the draggable/droppable code:

     $(document).ready(function() {
		init(); 
     $( ""#draggable"" ).draggable({
				snap:""#droppable"", snapMode: ""inner"", revert: ""valid""});
  		$( ""#droppable"" ).droppable({
  			drop: function( event, ui ) {
  				$( this )
  					.addClass( ""ui-state-highlight"" )
  					.find( ""p"" )
  						.html( ""Dropped!"" );
  			},
  			out: function( event, ui ) {
  				$( this )
  					.removeClass( ""ui-state-highlight"" )
  					.find( ""p"" )
  						.html( ""Drop here"" );
  			}
  		});
      });

here's the touch handler implementation:
    
     function touchHandler(event)
    {
     var touches = event.changedTouches,
    first = touches[0],
    type = """";

     switch(event.type)
    {
    case ""touchstart"": type = ""mousedown""; break;
    case ""touchmove"":  type=""mousemove""; break;

In the body of the html, I am using divs to call out the draggable and droppable. 
Not sure why it's not working...any guidance would be appreciated. ",jquery,android,html,webview,,,open,0,462,9,"How to implement drag and drop through android webview I implemented the simple webview app through android to point to an html file which will be used to drag and drop icons like a simple puzzle game. I used the jquery draggable and droppable libraries to implement on the html-side, but when I pulled it up on the webview, it didn't work. After searching the forums, I tried several fixes and none of them worked. I think that this post could be the answer, but it also didn't work out: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5186441/javascript-drag-and-drop-for-touch-devices. Although, I don't think I implemented it properly, since I just added it on to the code which uses the draggable/droppable from jquery.ui. 

  
Here's the draggable/droppable code:

     $(document).ready(function() {
		init(); 
     $( ""#draggable"" ).draggable({
				snap:""#droppable"", snapMode: ""inner"", revert: ""valid""});
  		$( ""#droppable"" ).droppable({
  			drop: function( event, ui ) {
  				$( this )
  					.addClass( ""ui-state-highlight"" )
  					.find( ""p"" )
  						.html( ""Dropped!"" );
  			},
  			out: function( event, ui ) {
  				$( this )
  					.removeClass( ""ui-state-highlight"" )
  					.find( ""p"" )
  						.html( ""Drop here"" );
  			}
  		});
      });

here's the touch handler implementation:
    
     function touchHandler(event)
    {
     var touches = event.changedTouches,
    first = touches[0],
    type = """";

     switch(event.type)
    {
    case ""touchstart"": type = ""mousedown""; break;
    case ""touchmove"":  type=""mousemove""; break;        
    case ""touchend"":   type=""mouseup""; break;
    default: return;
    }
    var simulatedEvent = document.createEvent(""MouseEvent"");
    simulatedEvent.initMouseEvent(type, true, true, window, 1,
                          first.screenX, first.screenY,
                          first.clientX, first.clientY, false,
                          false, false, false, 0/*left*/, null);

When you click the button for the 2nd time, I want the animation to play exactly in reverse, at the same slow speed... bringing the container back to the top, and hiding the top content.  Currently, the code im using is making the entire page disappear totally when the button is pressed the second time.  I do not want that.

*-Bonus-*

I also would like to, if at all possible, lock the header to the bottom of the page at a min-height when the button is first pressed to slide down.  The header would only be able to come up only so high when the window is shrunk, but if the window is fully expanded, the header is locked to the bottom of the page.  In a nutshell, You basically will see the header become the footer when the button is first pressed.

Not only that, I want to remove the ability to scroll the page down so that you can see the slid down container contents.  There should be no scroll bars once the container drops after pressing the slide down button.

*-Final Bonus-*

I would like to externally load another page automatically into the topContent div once the container is slid down and the top content is fully revealed.

I hope I can get help on this. Itd also be great if the coders who provide answers have contact info avaliable in case I need to need to follow up on your response",jquery,css,div,,,,open,0,280,16,"Push content in container down on click, load content into space revealed Jquery - Part 2 Before I begin, please reference this link which is Part 1 of my issue:

I want to make this as user-friendly as possible, since the FogBugz site (if any of you are familiar with it) already has a method of logging time on assigned bugs, though my boss isn't a big fan of the UI for it. Anyway, I am using the jQuery Tabs functionality to have multiple ways to enter time, and one tab simply shows a table of all of the bugs currently assigned to a user, displaying the bug ID, Status, Title, etc. I would like to try to use the jQuery Accordion to allow the user to click on a table row (or bug, as it were) and have a new container drown below it that lists the possible modifications which can be made (add time interval, remove time interval, edit time interval, etc).

I can see how to use both widgets separately just fine (more or less), but is it possible to make an entire table row (`<tr></tr>`) into a header for the accordion?

",jquery,html,jquery-ui,table,jquery-ui-accordion,,open,0,1281,12,"How Can I Turn a Table Row into a jQuery-UI Accordion Header? So I'm writing a web application for my company that is meant to aide programmers in modifying the time they claim to have spent on particular bugs assigned to them by their team leader or supervisor. I want to make this as user-friendly as possible, since the FogBugz site (if any of you are familiar with it) already has a method of logging time on assigned bugs, though my boss isn't a big fan of the UI for it. Anyway, I am using the jQuery Tabs functionality to have multiple ways to enter time, and one tab simply shows a table of all of the bugs currently assigned to a user, displaying the bug ID, Status, Title, etc. I would like to try to use the jQuery Accordion to allow the user to click on a table row (or bug, as it were) and have a new container drown below it that lists the possible modifications which can be made (add time interval, remove time interval, edit time interval, etc).

I can see how to use both widgets separately just fine (more or less), but is it possible to make an entire table row (`<tr></tr>`) into a header for the accordion?

I use the background image as part of an animation. On top of the background image I rotate a pointer image inside the canvas. The problem:


If I watch the animation inside the normal browser everthing is fine. 
If I build the App with Phonegap and use this html page as the first page everything is fine. 

But if I use this page inside the app as maybe the second page and I watch the animation. The whole canvas is white. It overlays the whole background image. Why is it white? Whats the problem in this special cases?

Commenting out `.siblings().removeAttr('disabled')` simply never removes the disabled attribute...but, I want to remove it ONLY if it isn't selected in any one of the select boxes. 

Basically, I only want an option to be selected in one of the selects at a time. I would think that if I could only `.removeAttr('disabled')` on the item that was just changed, I think that would work.  But, I'm not sure how to go about this.

Does anyone have any ideas?

Thanks!",jquery,jquery-selectors,,,,,open,0,441,10,"jQuery <select> option disabled if selected in multiple <select> boxes I have a question similar to the one asked here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4610652/jquery-select-option-disabled-if-selected-in-other-select

But, mine varies in that there will be more than two select boxes.  In the answer provided, when an option is selected, it is set to disabled in the other select boxes (which I want to happen), but I don't want any other options selected in a different select box to have disabled removed.  

Does that make sense?

    		J('#' + tinymce.activeEditor.id + '_parent').fadeTo(0, 0.5);
    	}
    }

But, if I call the function within the jQuery .ready the editor DOM obj is null.

How and where in code can I set/change the editor setting?

    	echo $editor->display('emailText', $this->articleFullText, '960', '700', '20', '20', false);
    ?>

Is it possible to set the editor settings in the default.php (view)? 
(I did not find any specific parameter)

I created the following function (thanks to stackoverflow) which enables or disables the editor

    function setEditorEditable(editable) {
    	if (editable == 1) {
    		tinymce.get(tinymce.activeEditor.id).getBody().setAttribute('contenteditable', 'true');
    		J('#' + tinymce.activeEditor.id + '_parent').fadeTo(0, 1);
    	} else {
    		tinymce.get(tinymce.activeEditor.id).getBody().setAttribute('contenteditable', 'false');
    		J('#' + tinymce.activeEditor.id + '_parent').fadeTo(0, 0.5);
    	}
    }

But, if I call the function within the jQuery .ready the editor DOM obj is null.

How and where in code can I set/change the editor setting?

Thanks!

7528493,09/23/2011 11:49:56,784841,06/05/2011 15:30:42,1,1,Flash overlay in IE,"I have a flash player on my website and I would like to add an overlay where I can insert HTML. The idea is that the div containing the flash will animate its opacity to 0.5 before display the HTML. I got this working great in Google Chrome and Firefox, but as always, IE is giving me a headache. I set wmode to opaque (and also tried transparent), but IE is behaving strangely. To make my div show on top of the flash video, I set its position to absolute and give it higher z-index than any other element.

The problem is that IE9 does not show the HTML I append to my div from jQuery. Fair enough, I can live with adding it from PHP in a hidden div. However, the big problems are that IE will not let me animate the flash player's opacity unlike Chrome and Firefox (and possibly other browsers) as well as let me interact with the flash player. When the overlay is displayed, the player is no longer responding when I click on it.

Some workarounds are needed for IE, but I have not been able to find a workaround for the opacity fading so far. Now for the code.

    </div>


**JavaScript (jQuery):** -- simplied for illustration purposes

    // Animate opacity to 0.5
    $('.videoWrapper').animate({ opacity: 0.5 }, { duration: 1000, queue: false, complete: function() { showOverlay(); } });

    function showOverlay() {

    	text-align: center;

    }

In the code above, the HTML that I append with jQuery is not shown, but like I said, I can fix that by adding it directly into the DOM, because then IE displays it. However, I would like the opacity animation to work, but IE9 does not appreciate it. Also, when doing like this, I cannot click on the player to start/stop the playback.

If i click on the ""CLICK"", ""ANIMATION ONE"" is executed correctly; at the end of the animation if i click again on the ""CLICK"" ""ANIMATION TWO"" is executed correctly; if i click on the ""CLICK"" while animation one is going (or while animation two is going) everything mess up.... the behavior that i would like to have is that if i click on the ""CLICK"" while an animation is going, the animation continue to go until his end, and after, the other animation start to go and if i click again the same behavior and so on... basically i would like to have a queue: anim one, anim two, anim one, etc... depending from my clicks. 

I tried using the .queue() and .dequeue() methods applied to $container but without success; i cannot tell that on the click my app should put the animation in the queue and not execute it...

please help me i'm getting crazy :D

Body markup for the content (they are not contained in the same div, nor can they be):

      <div class=""block"">

      </div>
      <div class=""block"">
        <p>Lorem ipsum</p>
      </div>

I'm trying to do two things. 1.) Hide everything except the first block of content (which corresponds with the first list item, hence .active, on load. 2.) On click of any of the list items it hides all the other blocks of content and shows the appropriate one, while adding an .active class to it in the nav.

Would really appreciate the help.",3

The first one has a list of Drupal themes and the second is a list of available regions.  In Drupal, certain themes have certain regions which are available to put blocks into so when a theme is chosen, I want the region selector to be populated by the available options associated to the selected theme.

I want my javascript file to use jQuery to listen to the theme selector so that on change, it will update the region selector. 

I have the module PHP set up so that there is a 2D array of values such that array['theme'] = array() of possible region values. Like this:

Array
(
    [garland] => Array
        (
            [left] => left
            [] => 
            [right] => right
        )

    [zen] => Array
        (
            [] => 
            [sidebar_first] => sidebar_first
            [sidebar_second] => sidebar_second
        )
)
That is done by this code:

    $themeQuery = db_query('SELECT DISTINCT theme from {blocks}');
    	while($row = db_fetch_object($themeQuery)){ 
    		$regionQuery = db_query('SELECT DISTINCT region from {blocks} WHERE theme=""%s""',$row->theme);
         while($regions = db_fetch_object($regionQuery)){
         	$regionOptions[$row->theme][$regions->region] = $regions->region;
         }
         $themeOptions[$row->theme] = $row->theme;
      }

And here is the form:

    $form = array();
     $form['title'] = array(
         '#type' 	=> 'markup',
     	 '#value'	=> '<br/><h4>Update block: <strong>'.$module.': '.$delta.'</strong></h4>'
      );
     $form['theme'] = array(
     	'#title' 			=> 'Theme',
        '#type'  			=> 'select',
        '#options' 			=> drupal_map_assoc($themeOptions),
     	'#default_value'	        => $currentTheme,
      );
      $form['region'] = array(
     	'#title' 			=> 'Region',
        '#type' 			=> 'select',
     	'#options'			=> array(''),
      	'#default_value' 	=> $currentRegion,
      );
    

The javascript is this so far:  
   

    $(document).ready(function(){

---------

I have designed a very easy to use MVC wizard.  The cherry on the cake is a spinner gif that will appear when I change wizard step.  I want it to center on the page, regardless of the size of the browser window.

You can see an example of this at:

[Sample Wizard][1]

PLEASE DON'T COMPLETE THE WIZARD, UNLESS YOU HAVE ENCEPHALITIS...

The Problem
-----------


Problem is, I have a centered CSS layout, controlled with the following rule:

    #PageContainer
    {
    	position:relative;
    	width:800px;
    	left:50%;	
    	margin:0px 0px 0px -400px;
    	text-align:left;
    }

And this rule seems to interact badly with the jquery code that centers the div with the spinner gif.  Ie, it doesn't center.

The Code
--------

My MVC form code is:

        @using (Ajax.BeginForm(Model.Step.ActionName, 
                 null, 
                 new AjaxOptions { UpdateTargetId = ""wizardStep"", OnBegin=""isValid"", LoadingElementId=""PleaseWait"" }, 
                 new {@name=""wizardForm"", @id=""wizardForm"" } ))
            { 
            @* do ajax stuff, see my ""Loading... panel below *@
    
            <div id=""PleaseWait"" style=""display:none;"">
                Please Wait...
            </div>
            } 

jQuery code is:

    <script type=""text/javascript"">
            jQuery.fn.center = function () {
                this.css(""position"", ""absolute"");
                this.css(""top"", ($(window).height() - this.height())/ 2 + $(window).scrollTop() + ""px"");
                this.css(""left"", ($(window).width() - this.width()) / 2 + $(window).scrollLeft() + ""px"");
                return this;
            }
            });
            function isValid() {
                $('#PleaseWait').center();
                if (true) // In case i whant to return true
                {
                    return true;
                }
                else // I whant to return false
                {
                    $('#PleaseWait').hide(); // Manually hide the LoadingElementId
                    return false;
                }
            }   
    </script>

My Analysis
---------------------------

As the jQuery code sets up the div panel to have an absolute position, it therefore has an absolute position relative to the first parent item that does not have position static (the default).

Therefore, as a result of the margin hack used to center the page, there is something creeping into the jQuery calculation that upsets the apple cart.

Ie:

The jQuery calculation is based on the size of the window, but the position of the #PleaseWait panel is positioned with respect to the #PageContainer div (this div is part of the layout).  Obviously, these are two very different things.  I therefore thought I would get away with figuring out the constant values to subtract from the top and left calculations for the #PleaseWait div.

However, the results are unpredictable and I am now too befuddled to figure it out.  Help!

Any help much appreciated.

Notice I let the browser render three cells in one table, and since I can visually see that #qcell2 is the longest, I draw a second table setting all the widths to what I determine the width from #qcell2 to be.  Since I can let the browser first render all the cells and the table is amply wide such that the browser is not trying to compress the cells I get what a comfortable maximum width for all the cells should be.  I want to use that info to now calculate how many cells per row I can draw such that they are all uniformly sized and use all the real estate available to the table.

Again, ultimately, I will begin with a simple array of strings and create a table with cells for as many of the strings as I can comfortably place in the table such that they are all uniformly sized to be the size of the cell holding the widest string.

I hope someone could guide me.

Thanks.",3

I tried using class instead of ID, but when I do that the slider just disappears as jQuery Ui seem to attach few of its own class on runtime to the slider.

my first approach was to create a div with the floorplan as background.  
inside that div i added 100 smaller divs, all with dimensions 10%x10%. (10 accross, 10 down)

this actually displays the little rectangular divs on top of the floorplan and my idea was to have jquery display different pictures or options depending on what div the user will be hovering.

my problem with that approach was that i could not restrict the main div's dimensions to the aspect ratio of the floorplan image, which is not convinient as i want a solution that will work for multiple plans i might upload.

my other approach is to include the image inside the main div with an img tag and display the smaller divs on top of it, but i am not able to do that with css, anything i do would put the small divs after the img

any other ideas/ways i could achieve that?
is there a way to restric the div to it's background picture's ratio?

Thank you.",jquery,asp.net,,,,05/21/2012 17:34:07,not a real question,1,1168,6,"jQuery show elements inside each td I've tried to make visible some elements depending of a X value, but I tried to put it as static for (""div:nth-child(5)"") this div contains all controls hidden after page onLoad event, so I used .show(); and also attempted to remove attributes with .removeAttr(); but I can't figure out why I can't get out this. 

This is an asp.net 2.0 webforms app, I need to use client side so I decided to use jQuery 1.7.1

**First things first**: set `multiselect: true` in the grid definition (I didn't set any other multiselect options)

Development page in question:  [http://allwebcafe.com/newsite/][1]

###First Issue
Click on the green arrow in the top nav under ""Results"".  This is supposed to slide out a menu from right to left.  It behaves as it should in Firefox, but IE and Safari start the slide left animation way over in the middle of the page and then shift the menu back where it belongs.  I have no idea why it's doing this since the menu itself is absolutely positioned in the CSS. Another issue is once the menu is open and you attempt to close it (using the similarly colored arrow), it transitions as it should in Firefox, but then reappears once the transition is complete.  In IE and Safari, the menu disappears permanently, but the animation again starts in the middle of the page.

###Second (sorta) Issue
If this slide thing can be worked out, I'd like to apply a similar effect to the bottom ""buckets"", which slide up and down as you click on the gray arrow box beneath them.  Currently, I'm hacking at the .animate function in jQuery to first increase the height, then apply a negative margin, like so:

    $('#footer-bucket1')
        .animate({ height: '392px' }, 300)
        .animate({ marginTop: '-306px'}, 300)
        .addClass('bucket-open');

When I applied a slide up transition to it, I could see that the box was getting bigger, but in a downward direction, off the page (which has overflow: hidden applied to it).  Is there a way to specify that the box literally slide up to reveal the content, much like it does now? Thanks in advance!

Why it's not work? 
Side by side by the way - I checked and they work both. However, as a nested <ul> - mean, when I tried to put the horizontal inside the vertical it's not work.

This is a game were a user enters a random number, then clicks ""Play"",
they'll see a set of boxes appear with randomly generated numbers. They object of the game is to click on the box that has your number to build points.

My site members are now just sitting on one box and waiting for their number to show up. To help stop that I made it so they can't click on the same box twice (with the help of stackoverflow). Now they just switch back and forth between 2 boxes.

A stack member had suggested a great idea to combat that. Which is if there are 7 boxes in the game and the user's number appears in a box they did not click, then they should lose a point. This will force them to play all the boxes instead of just 2 boxes. And adding a count down timer as well so they don't take all day..

",jquery,,,,,11/16/2010 21:51:58,not a real question,1,730,4,"Jquery random numbers game Hey All, I've tried everything, but this is still just too easy for the user.

This is a game were a user enters a random number, then clicks ""Play"",
they'll see a set of boxes appear with randomly generated numbers. They object of the game is to click on the box that has your number to build points.

My site members are now just sitting on one box and waiting for their number to show up. To help stop that I made it so they can't click on the same box twice (with the help of stackoverflow). Now they just switch back and forth between 2 boxes.

A stack member had suggested a great idea to combat that. Which is if there are 7 boxes in the game and the user's number appears in a box they did not click, then they should lose a point. This will force them to play all the boxes instead of just 2 boxes. And adding a count down timer as well so they don't take all day..

There is an existing jQuery quote in place that switch the tabs content and makes the div active based on click function.

The jQuery code is

     if ($('#body.search-form .component.tab').length) {
        	$('.tab-wrapper > div').not('.tab-wrapper > div:nth-child(1)').hide();

                $(this).addClass('active');
            });
        }; 

The problem I have and this is a long outstanding ticket that I had to repost is:

A user after clicking search from within each tab, it lands to a search results page. In each page of the results page there is a redefine search link. That link is in the form
of `<a href=""./redefine"">redefine search</a>`

There is java code in place the redefine controller that recognise what was the last search.

So basically I have statements in place in my form page as follows

   

    <c:if test=""${searchArguments.type=='shirts'}"">
       $(""div#2"").hide();
       $(""div#3"").hide();
       $(""div#1"").show();
     </c:if>
     <c:if test=""${searchArguments.type=='jeans'}"">
       $(""div#1"").hide();
       $(""div#3"").hide();
       $(""div#2"").show();     
      </c:if
    <c:if test=""${searchArguments.type=='shoes'}"">
        $(""div#1"").hide();
        $(""div#2"").hide();
        $(""div#3"").show();    
    </c:if>

the above jquery inside the statements doesn't work for me as it is overwritten from the existing jquery. I want to know what jQuery needs to be inside each one of them, so it make the relevant tab open and active for each scenario.

            });
        }; 

The problem I have and this is a long outstanding ticket that I had to repost is:

A user after clicking search from within each tab, it lands to a search results page. In each page of the results page there is a redefine search link. That link is in the form
of `<a href=""./redefine"">redefine search</a>`

There is java code in place the redefine controller that recognise what was the last search.

So basically I have statements in place in my form page as follows

   

    <c:if test=""${searchArguments.type=='shirts'}"">
       $(""div#2"").hide();
       $(""div#3"").hide();
       $(""div#1"").show();
     </c:if>
     <c:if test=""${searchArguments.type=='jeans'}"">
       $(""div#1"").hide();
       $(""div#3"").hide();
       $(""div#2"").show();     
      </c:if
    <c:if test=""${searchArguments.type=='shoes'}"">
        $(""div#1"").hide();
        $(""div#2"").hide();
        $(""div#3"").show();    
    </c:if>

the above jquery inside the statements doesn't work for me as it is overwritten from the existing jquery. I want to know what jQuery needs to be inside each one of them, so it make the relevant tab open and active for each scenario.

I know this can be done in a different way but thats the set up I have to work on, will that be possilbe to have the javascript in place",4

The result that I see after a call to createNewRadioButton is made is a new label with the desired text is added but no new radio button.  So instead of a nice new jQuery radio button sitting underneath whatever was already there, I see just a new label with text equivelant to product.Name (in the given example).

I've also noticed this warning output in firebug after a call is made to createNewRadioButton - could this have anything to do with it?

This feature is particularly useful if I use a dialog to add/edit/delete elements in a grid: I can pass a function that does a grid update and when the dialog is closed the grid will update itself.

I am experiencing that, in some cases, the function binded to the `dialogclose` event is called more than once and I am suspecting that the problem is related to the fact that multiple calls to my `loadDialog` function will bind multiple reference of the same close handler.

Am I correct? Do I have to explicitly unbind everything whn the dialog close?

in a class, so I can do something like

    var child = new Element(); and var subchild = new Element();

and then use `child.label , child.text and child.key`...
But again, not sure how to use the jquery methods with these... I have more nodes to process and I don't want to keep doing stuff like `var label = $(this).get(0).tagName; and then var childLabel = $(this).get(0).tagName;`

		$(""book, site"", xml).children().each(function() {
			var label = $(this).get(0).tagName;
			var text = $(this).text();
			var key = toCamelCase(label);
			if ((key in siteData) && (text != -1)){
			if (isArray(siteData[key]))
			{   
				$(this).children().each(function (){
					var childLabel = $(this).get(0).tagName;
					var childText = $(this).text();
					var childKey = toCamelCase(childLabel);
					if(isArray(siteData[key][childKey]))
					{
					  siteData[key][childKey].push(childText);  
					}
					else {
						siteData[key].push(childText);
					}
				});  
			}
			else 
			{
				siteData[key] = text;
				}
			};
		}); 
		}
		});

I want to place 

    var label = $(this).get(0).tagName; var text = $(this).text(); var key = toCamelCase(label);

in a class, so I can do something like

    var child = new Element(); and var subchild = new Element();

and then use `child.label , child.text and child.key`...
But again, not sure how to use the jquery methods with these... I have more nodes to process and I don't want to keep doing stuff like `var label = $(this).get(0).tagName; and then var childLabel = $(this).get(0).tagName;`


Thanks.

In order to make the `<a>` anchors work, I'm using the following two calls:

    $('#dialog a.ok').click(function() {
        $.ajax({ ... });
        $(this).closest('#dialog').dialog('close');

    $('#dialog').execute(function() {

That would also degrades gracefully.

I tried the following menu, which seemed promising, but is confusing with the function it calls.

0. In Internet Explorer (7 and 8), the first thumbnail never displays the lightbox (the `onload` event never fires).
0. In IE7, the code to fix the ClearType bug doesn't work. `$(this).css( 'opacity', '' )` should remove the opacity style (in this case, the 'filter' property) but it doesn't remove it. In IE's dev tools it still has `style=""filter: ;""`
0. In Opera, it never runs after it has loaded once. In other words, if an image is in the browser cache the `onload` event never fires.

I know I can probably put each of the dropdown lists into their own seperate classes, but is there a way to do this with an array? To be able to click on a top-level list item and bring the appropriate dropdown list.
