On my main content page I am working on im running into an issue with creating a tables using CSS and div ids. 

Overview
=========
The table is compromised of 2 rows and 6 columns and then spilt into 12 boxes which each box 200px X 200px. Now the content of each box contains a new item (@books) which is generated from a separate controller(used the built in generate scaffold command).  I am also using pagination to limit the items on the page (12) so older items just roll on back. 

Issue
=======
I am able to populate each of the 12 boxes with new content by using the following code on my controller and view

controller
  

    def content
    @books= Book.paginate(:page => params[:page], :per_page => 12)
    respond_to do |format|
      format.html # content.html.erb
    end

      <div id=""column1"">
    	  <tr>
    	    <td><%= book.name %></td>
    	    <td><%= book.title %></td>
    	    <td><%= book.content %></td>
    	    <td><%= link_to 'Show', video %></td>
    	 </tr>
      </div>
    	<% end %>
    <br />
    <div id=""paginate"">
    	<%= will_paginate(@books, 
    ) %)
    </div>
    </div>

What happens when I generate the view is that everything is rendering perfectly but all of my books are using the same 'column 1'

 

         <div id=""column1"">
    	  <tr>
    	    <td>Title</td>
    	    <td>Name</td>
    	    <td>Content</td>

    	 </tr>
      </div>

I would like for each book to have its own column {2, 3,4,5,6,7-12} so i can target each individually if i needed to using jquery. The other is that i would like to use render partial for everything in the <tr></tr> but when i use the render partial it places all the items within the 1 column so it just repeats all the contained information. I have a feeling im suppose to use another method or edit the current one to complete this but I'm unsure what goes were. Thanks!

6301081,06/10/2011 01:30:17,328421,04/29/2010 01:03:04,132,8,How to deal with different gem dependencies within Bundler for scripts within a single Rails project?,"Our Rails application pulls feeds from multiple sources. The workers that pull these feeds need gem dependencies for rmagick, oracle databases, and many other gems. In short, they have very different dependency needs than the main web application. Until Rails 3 and Bundler, life was good.

These worker gem dependencies are irrelevant to our actual production website. Under Rails 3, one Gemfile is expected to contain all these dependencies. This has the nasty side effect of requiring all gem dependencies to be loaded within the production app, which would cause pointless bloat, possible security issues, memory leaks, complicate deployment, and other ills. Sadly, Bundler breaks the standard require mechanism, which would have provided a way out of the quagmire by allowing us to simply requiring the necessary gems only in the worker and having them somewhere on the system. The workers use our rails models to file their data.

Can anyone suggest solutions to make the system practical in Rails 3? I am tempted to make the Gemfile use conditional environment variables in places to drive the gem commands, however, it seems the Gemfile.lock could make this problematic going from working on one worker script (for the feeds) to the next, which would have different dependencies.  Help???

In Rails 3.2.2, I have the following stylesheets:
<pre>
    app/assets/stylesheets
    |
    |-- <b>application.css</b>
    |-- <b>bootstrap_and_overrides.css.less</b>
    |
    |-- annotations.css.less
    |-- maps.css.less.erb
    `-- users.css.less.erb
</pre>

The two first ones are more or less system-default. The other ones are where I define my custom styles.

So, `application.css`, as usual, includes all the other files:

    *= require_self
    *= require_tree .

And `bootstrap_and_overrides.css.less`, of course, includes Twitter Bootstrap as well as some other custom defined LESS variables.

    @import ""twitter/bootstrap/responsive"";
    // other stuff
    @brown_text: #332820;


----------


### What doesn't work:

Now, in `annotations.css.less`, I'd like to use `@brown_text`, but it gives me:

> <code>variable @brown_text is undefined</code>

I figure this is because there's no reference from `annotations.css.less` to the ""master"" file where the variable would be defined. And it seems that `annotations.css.less` is compiled first – note that I'm currently in development environment.

So, how can I use my custom LESS variables then, and make them available in other stylesheet files?

    <% form_tag('switch_car', :method => :put, :name => ""switch_car"", :remote => true) do %>
    <div class=""field"">
        <label>Car Name:</label>
        <%= select_tag(:id, options_from_collection_for_select(active_cars, ""id"", ""name""), :onchange => ""submitForm('switch_car')"", :include_blank => true)%>
    </div>
    
    <% end %>

Here is my javascript function: just a simple submit.

        <script type=""text/javascript"" charset=""UTF-8"">
    	function submitForm(formname){
    		document.switch_car.submit();
    	}
      </script>

Here is the HTML generated:

    <form accept-charset=""UTF-8"" action=""switch_car"" data-remote=""true"" method=""post"" name=""switch_car""><div style=""margin:0;padding:0;display:inline""><input name=""utf8"" type=""hidden"" value=""&#x2713;"" /><input name=""_method"" type=""hidden"" value=""put"" /><input name=""authenticity_token"" type=""hidden"" value=""PEbdqAoiik37lcoP4+v+dakpYxdpMkSm7Ub8eZpdF9I="" /></div><div class=""field""> 
        <label>Car Name:</label> 
        <select id=""id"" name=""id"" onchange=""submitForm('switch_car')""><option value=""""></option><option value=""9"">Truck</option> 
    <option value=""10"">Car</option></select> 
    </div> 

Anybody know why the javascript submit causes a different result than the button on the same form?  If so can I get the javascript submit to work with an Ajax result?

My problem is the next:

I am coding a wizard form with multiple models and relations. So My application has products which has many images through Image model (Its has been mounted with carrierwave).

Because the form has many steps I want save temporaly the images with cache option in CarrierWave. then i last step i want recover the images and load my product. So I create a model called TempData which save temporaly data (In this case cache_name), a type_identifier and a mark can_be_deleted.

For example these are my models:

Now imagine a client comes up and tells me ""Hey, this app looks good ! Could I have just the same one, but with my logo and votes also on comments ?""

So ok I clone the app, make the changes, then I deliver the tweaked app to the client, and then I get back to my original app and continue to make it better. 

A couple on months later another client come and also wants the same app (now improved) but with votes also on comments.

Of course I realize cloning the app in the first place what a crappy idea.

What I'd like to know is how would you do from the beginning to make it as easy, maintainable and DRY to reuse the feature made for the first client in the second's project ?

Then, imagine lots of clients come with lots of different requested features. Now you realize it would be just awesome to be able to 'build' a new app with just this feature or this one, but not this one, and so forth.

How would you achieve that ?

I imagine git branches could be a nice way to achieve that, or maybe Rails Engines/Gems, or I don't know, but I'm definitely not git or rails skilled enough to clearly see in my mind how it would be.

I've decided to go with the mysql2 gem. There's some legacy code in the app that makes calls like:

results = ActiveRecord::Base.connection.execute(sql)

In the 2.3.x version, it used
results.each_hash do |row|
...

But with gem mysql2, results is type Mysql2::Result, which has only an 'each' method. Checked the docs and they specify results should be a hash keyed on field name. Great!

But in fact, it is an Array, not a Hash.

When I use the rails console and instantiate my own Mysql2::Client and run the query there, the results *are* a Hash, which is what I want.

In the rails application, I think it's better to use ActiveRecord::Base.connection, since it's been instantiated with options from database.yml. 

Note, unfortunately the result does not map to a model, so I can't use that.

What I've done for now is, for example:
result = ActiveRecord::Base.connection.execute(sql)
field_index = result.fields.index(""field"")
result.each do |row|
  row[field_index]
end

Which is ugly as sin.

Does anyone how I can get it to return a Hash instead of Array?

Right now I am modifying scaffolded forms and such.  

My question is with the ""create"" method in one of my controllers. There are two entities I am concerned with:  the User table and the Habit table.  I created a dropdown box in the _form partial for the Habit views to allow a person to select a user from a list of all available when creating a habit as below

    <%= collection_select  :user, :id, @users, :id, :first_name %>

The habit controller, of course, has

    def new
      @users = User.all
      ...    
    end

This works fine, and when the form submits it posts two hashes of parameters :habit and :user. Now, when I want to process the form input in the create method, I'm not sure how to use the syntax correctly and assign the user_id to the newly create habit.  What I WANT to do is something like this

    def create

This, of course, is improper syntax. 

    def create

    end

What works is the following, but the code is very lengthy, assigning each value manually.

I have both `user` and `profile` models. As part of the sign-up process I'm mixing fields for both `user` and `profile`, so I'm using nested forms.

I'm trying to get the nested forms to work in a controller that handles my static pages, because I want to initiate the signup process on the home page.

The sign-up process can be initiated two ways: Directly from the homepage or skipped on the homepage and initiated at a /signup/skip view.

My InfoController (where the `home.html.erb` file with the form exists):

    def home
      if logged_in?
        redirect_to current_user.profile
      end
    end

Nested form in `home.html.erb`:

    <%= form_for(:profile, :url => 'signup', :html => {:id => 'homepage'}) do |f| %>
      <p class=""hometext"">I'm&nbsp;</p>
      <div>
        <%= f.label :first_name, :placeholder => 'First name' %>
        <%= f.text_field :first_name, :size=> 8, :id => ""profile[first_name]"" %>
      </div>
      <div>
        <label for=""profile[last_name]"">Last name</label>
        <%= f.text_field :last_name, :size=> 8, :id => ""profile[last_name]"" %>
      </div>
      <%= f.fields_for :user do |f| %>
      <p class=""hometext"">.&nbsp;My&nbsp;email&nbsp;is&nbsp;
        <div>
          <label for=""user[email]"">Email</label>
          <%= f.text_field :email, :size=> 13, :id => ""user[email]"" %>
        </div>
      <% end %>
      <p class=""hometext"">.&nbsp;I want to&nbsp;</p>
      <div>
        <label for=""user[goal]"">ex: be President</label>
        <%= f.text_field :goal, :size=> 13, :id => ""user[goal]"" %>
      </div>
      <p class=""hometext"">when I grow up.&nbsp;</p>
      <div id=""button"">
        <%= submit_tag 'Join', :class => 'button orange' %>

Profile Model:

    class Profile < ActiveRecord::Base
      attr_accessible :first_name, :last_name ...
      belongs_to :user
      accepts_nested_attributes_for :user

      attr_accessor :password, :email
      accepts_nested_attributes_for :profile
      has_one :profile, :dependent => :destroy
    end

For some reason, when I enter data in the form I am redirected to /login, which is in `Routes.rb` as `Sessions#new`. So here's SessionsController:

    class SessionsController < ApplicationController
      def create
        if user = User.authenticate(params[:email], params[:password])
          session[:user_id] = user.id
          redirect_to user.profile, :notice => ""Logged in successfully""
        else
          flash.now[:alert] = ""Invalid login/password. Try again!""
          render :action => 'new'
        end
      end

And last but not least the ProfilesController:

    class ProfilesController < ApplicationController
      def new
        @profile = Profile.new
      end

      def create
        @profile = Profile.new(params[:profile])
        if @profile.save
          redirect_to profile_path, :notice => 'User successfully added.'
        else
          render :action => 'new'
        end
      end

I have both `user` and `profile` models. As part of the sign-up process I'm mixing fields for both `user` and `profile`, so I'm using nested forms.

I'm trying to get the nested forms to work in a controller that handles my static pages, because I want to initiate the signup process on the home page.

The sign-up process can be initiated two ways: Directly from the homepage or skipped on the homepage and initiated at a /signup/skip view.

My InfoController (where the `home.html.erb` file with the form exists):

    def home
      if logged_in?
        redirect_to current_user.profile
      end
    end

Nested form in `home.html.erb`:

    <%= form_for(:profile, :url => 'signup', :html => {:id => 'homepage'}) do |f| %>
      <p class=""hometext"">I'm&nbsp;</p>
      <div>
        <%= f.label :first_name, :placeholder => 'First name' %>
        <%= f.text_field :first_name, :size=> 8, :id => ""profile[first_name]"" %>
      </div>
      <div>
        <label for=""profile[last_name]"">Last name</label>
        <%= f.text_field :last_name, :size=> 8, :id => ""profile[last_name]"" %>
      </div>
      <%= f.fields_for :user do |f| %>
      <p class=""hometext"">.&nbsp;My&nbsp;email&nbsp;is&nbsp;
        <div>
          <label for=""user[email]"">Email</label>
          <%= f.text_field :email, :size=> 13, :id => ""user[email]"" %>
        </div>
      <% end %>
      <p class=""hometext"">.&nbsp;I want to&nbsp;</p>
      <div>
        <label for=""user[goal]"">ex: be President</label>
        <%= f.text_field :goal, :size=> 13, :id => ""user[goal]"" %>
      </div>
      <p class=""hometext"">when I grow up.&nbsp;</p>

        <%= submit_tag 'Join', :class => 'button orange' %>

Profile Model:

    class Profile < ActiveRecord::Base
      attr_accessible :first_name, :last_name ...
      belongs_to :user
      accepts_nested_attributes_for :user
    end

User Model:

    class User < ActiveRecord::Base
      attr_accessor :password, :email
      accepts_nested_attributes_for :profile
      has_one :profile, :dependent => :destroy
    end

For some reason, when I enter data in the form I am redirected to /login, which is in `Routes.rb` as `Sessions#new`. So here's SessionsController:

    class SessionsController < ApplicationController
      def create
        if user = User.authenticate(params[:email], params[:password])
          session[:user_id] = user.id
          redirect_to user.profile, :notice => ""Logged in successfully""
        else
          flash.now[:alert] = ""Invalid login/password. Try again!""
          render :action => 'new'
        end
      end

And last but not least the ProfilesController:

    class ProfilesController < ApplicationController
      def new
        @profile = Profile.new
      end

      def create
        @profile = Profile.new(params[:profile])
        if @profile.save
          redirect_to profile_path, :notice => 'User successfully added.'
        else
          render :action => 'new'
        end
      end

      validates :attribute_2, presence: true,  uniqueness: {scope: :user_id, message: ""must be unique.""} # This fails!
    end

The first validation works great, but the second fails with and *undestandable* `undefined method 'text?' for nil:NilClass`.

In database everything is stored in yaml format. but we cannot be sure about the order, so which is the best way to perform such validation?

**Disclaimer**

I know that, maybe, in this case store the attributes together is not a great idea, mostly for performance issues, but it's an interesting topic anyway.

    @ans = Answer.where(user_id = current_user.id)
    @answers = @questions.map { |q| [q, @ans.find_by_question_id(q.id)] }

Each answer record has a question_id field so it can be linked to the appropriate question. I am trying to get the answers array to list out in the same order as the questions.

The following code in a view renders the answers but not in the correct order.

    <% @ans.each do |q| %>
      <%=q.score%><br/>
    <% end %>

I then changed the array to the mapped array which should produce the answers in the appropriate order.

    root :to => ""portal#index""

In the portal controller, Devise steps in to authenticate the user

    before_filter :authenticate_user!

and redirects users to /users/sign_in

All that works fine...

I'm seeing a lot of intrusion attempts in my logs that have this type of url

    example.com/?gclid=CPTKkZqfu6kCFVOFzAodLUa9-Q

I want to log visitors to the site *WITHIN* the Rails app and I want to use this string to distinguish real visitors from intrusion attempts

But I lose that query string through the redirection to /users/sign_in...

Is there any way to capture that initial query string within the Rails app, other than in the web server logs?

One thought...I am using Rails3 so I'm using Rack under the hood - might I have access to the string through Rack?

thanks

All regular users have the same abilities. I was just about to use cancan to separate abilities based on user roles. Then it occurred to me that using cancan may just be overkill. does it make sense to just create a different class of user instead? Am I giving anything up by doing this? 

I can foresee in the future that if this app is successful, there may be different roles for users (a free versus paid account, etc). Even in that case, does it make sense to NOT have an admin user via devise? Thoughts?
