- Infrastructure (Think national level)
- Computer industry business management

These are my desired topics for the next 8 months or so, and I would like to immerse myself into said topics in different methods.
Note that I'm not asking about what is everybody's top 10 books, rather I'm asking about each of the above categories. 
For example in **Security**, what do you think is the solid reference, which one do you think is the interesting, thought provoking read, and which one do you think is the Hidden Gem that is amazing but not well known?

Thanks in advance! ",4
