I'm especially interested in books about languages, but I'd like to hear about other kinds of programming books as well.

For example, JVM languages are hot topic, and there's at least two new books that are partially completed, and available in web:
[Programming Clojure][1] and [Programming Scala][2].

   a. Start by reading a book about it.

   b. Dig in, learn as you go, and when you are comfortable with the technology grab a book to perfect your knowledge.

I'd personally go with a) (and have so far) but I'm pretty much the only one around in my shop doing this, lots of developers chose b), so I'm interested to know what would you chose and why.

<hr />

I posted a <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/220896/should-i-find-a-new-career"">question</a> on this site back in October about how my job was causing me health problems.  

Fortunately, things got better when I returned and I was able to handle the job pretty well for the last four months. I've started to notice, however, that I've gotten very complacent about my goals of training myself to get out of the job.

I got my start late (I was in Grade 10 - I was 15 or so, much later than most of my close college friends) and had high school classes which used VB6 and (Turbo) Pascal. I discovered I liked it, and seemed to do well in the class without really trying in a year when I was practically failing everything else due to personal issues. I decided to try it out in college (university not being an option due to grades - snowball effect from the bad year. I'm Canadian, so there's a solid distinction between College and University for me).  

College was very vocational. I literally had classes in C++ and COBOL - language syntax classes, really, with the hope that some theory and good foundations would magically form.  

So, now I'm doing maintenance on a system which essentially boils down to multi-million LOC worth scripts in an MPE (HP) offshoot JCL (a proprietary unix shell to emulate deprecated hardware) and COBOL. I essentially consider this job career suicide, and I desperately want to escape.  

The problem I see is that when I get home from work, I'm mentally wiped and just want to zone out. Although I love programming, I just can't bring myself to do it when I get home (plus, I have a serious problem of finding interesting projects to code). I end up reading blogs like Coding Horror and lurking the programming subreddit all night.  

What I need to know is, how can I start over with programming. I've caught myself thinking in a very COBOL mindset, and I need to get rid of it. Is it entirely reckless for me to quit my job and spend a month hammering the books and the compiler, trying to find my way? I hesitate to do this for financial reasons - I'm very close to paying off my student debts, but my finances for the moment are technically credit-based and I don't want to fall back further in debt.

For those of you on this site who are in charge of hiring, what would you think of an unsolicited email from someone with shockingly little real experience who wants to take on a junior programmer role, essentially using you as training (a post-grad co-op sort of thing). I know the best way to get ahead is to find great mentors and learn from them, and that's just what I want to do. I just don't know how I can convince someone to take a chance on me.

I want to dedicate an hour each night to bringing myself up to speed, but I need direction. How do I start over to get into the career I want, rather than the death spiral I'm in now?

Although I love programming, I just can't bring myself to do it when I get home (plus, I have a serious problem of finding interesting projects to code). I end up reading blogs like Coding Horror and lurking the programming subreddit all night.  

What I need to know is, how can I start over with programming. I've caught myself thinking in a very COBOL mindset, and I need to get rid of it. Is it entirely reckless for me to quit my job and spend a month hammering the books and the compiler, trying to find my way? I hesitate to do this for financial reasons - I'm very close to paying off my student debts, but my finances for the moment are technically credit-based and I don't want to fall back further in debt.

For those of you on this site who are in charge of hiring, what would you think of an unsolicited email from someone with shockingly little real experience who wants to take on a junior programmer role, essentially using you as training (a post-grad co-op sort of thing). I know the best way to get ahead is to find great mentors and learn from them, and that's just what I want to do. I just don't know how I can convince someone to take a chance on me.

I want to dedicate an hour each night to bringing myself up to speed, but I need direction. How do I start over to get into the career I want, rather than the death spiral I'm in now?

In this semester I am taking a course named : Information System Design. Teachers refereed to [System Analysis Design by Alan Dennis](http://www.amazon.com/Systems-Analysis-Design-Alan-Dennis/dp/0470228547) for this course. But I dont like this book at all. Whenever I am reading it I feels like I just have to read and memorize all of these pointless(mostly old) stuff to write then on the answer script. I was looking for something which is biased toward the real world practical work oriented, and on the fly I will learn differnt approaches with examples.

For example, I am an aspiring indie game developers. I haven't worked out any TDD or Agile development methodology in my workflow. So, I want to study them in such a way, so I can use those knowledge directly.

I am looking for a good book, that will teach me all the necessary things about modern Software Development Life Cycle(SDLC), and I will grab necessary juice to use them with my workflow. Rather then following classes I prefer to study book.

Any other ideas or guidelines are welcome.",books,suggestions,,,,07/26/2011 09:43:18,off topic,1,178,8,"Picking a good book for Information System Design I am a Computer Science student.

It would be OK if I go to Wiki and search for any questions that appear in mind, but I want a book that organized and cover all the stuffs from the basics so that I can understand clearly about the computers in order to write good software as well as scale large websites in the future ?
Really glad to see your help, thanks !
