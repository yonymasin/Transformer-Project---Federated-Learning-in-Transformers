I have a UILabel holding various amounts of text (from single characters to several sentences). The text should always be displayed in the largest possible font that fits all the text within the UILabel.
The maximum number of lines is set to 4 and the line break mode is set to word wrap.

Since multiple lines are used, adjustsFontSizeToFitWidth won't work for resizing the text.

Thus I am using a loop to determine the largest possible font size for each string as such:

>         //Set the text  
>         self.textLabel.text = text;
>         //Largest size used  
>         NSInteger fsize = 200;  textLabel.font = [UIFont
>         fontWithName:@""Verdana-Bold""
>         size:fsize];
>  
>         //Calculate size of the rendered string with the current parameters
>         float height = [text sizeWithFont:textLabel.font
>             constrainedToSize:CGSizeMake(textLabel.bounds.size.width,99999) 
>             lineBreakMode:UILineBreakModeWordWrap].height;
>         
>         //Reduce font size by 5 while too large, break if no height (empty string)
>         while (height > textLabel.bounds.size.height and height != 0) {   
>             fsize -= 5;  
>             textLabel.font = [UIFont fontWithName:@""Verdana-Bold"" size:fsize];   
>             height = [text sizeWithFont:textLabel.font 
>                 constrainedToSize:CGSizeMake(textLabel.bounds.size.width,99999) 
>                 lineBreakMode:UILineBreakModeWordWrap].height;
>         };

This approach works well for the most part.
The exception are long words.
Let's take the string @""The experience foo."" as an example.
The word ""experience"", being much longer than the others will be split in half without being word-wrapped correctly and the string split across 4 lines.
I am looking for a way to reduce the size further so that each individual word fits in one line.

Example:

-old-

Font size: 60
>     The
>     Exper
>     ience
>     foo

should be

-new-

Font size: 30

Is there another way to detect if the software keyboard is shown?,1

There are some samples, but they are usually quite detailed (on the developer forum there is one for iCloud and CoreData which is massive). The [apple docs][1] are OK, but I still can't see the big picture. So please bear with me, some of these questions are quite fundamental, but possible easy to answer.

**Context:** I'm have a very simple iCloud app running. There is only one UITextView shown to the user and his/her input is saved in a file called text.txt. This file is pushed to the cloud and made available to all devices. Works perfectly, but:

**Main problem: What about users who do not use iCloud?**

When I launch my app (see code below), I check if the user has iCloud enabled. If iCloud is enabled, everything is fine. The app goes ahead and looks for text.txt in the cloud. If found, it will load it and display it to the user. If text.txt is not found in the cloud, it will simply create a new text.txt and will display that to the user. 

If the user does not have iCloud enabled, nothing will happen. How will I make it possible that non-iCloud users can still work with my text app? Or do I simply ignore them? Would I need to write separate functions for non-iCloud users? I.e. functions in which I simply load a text.txt from the documents folder?

[Apple writes][2]: 

> Treat files in iCloud the same way you treat all other files in your app sandbox.

However, in my case there is no 'normal' app sandbox anymore. It's in the cloud. Or do I always load my text.txt from disk first and then check with iCloud if there is something more up-to-date?

**Related problem: File structure - Sandbox vs. Cloud**

Perhaps my main problem is related to a fundamental misunderstanding of how iCloud is supposed to work. When I create a new instance of an UIDocument, I'll have to overwrite two methods. First `- (BOOL)loadFromContents:(id)contents ofType:(NSString *)typeName error:(NSError **)outError` to get files from the cloud and then `-(id)contentsForType:(NSString *)typeName error:(NSError **)outError` to get files into the cloud.

Do I have to incorporate separate functions which will also save a local copy of text.txt into my sandbox? Will this work for non-iCloud users? As I understand iCloud, it will save a local copy of text.txt automatically. So there shouldn't be any need for me save anything into the 'old' sandbox of my app (i.e. as it used to be). Right now, my sandbox is totally empty, but I don't know if this is correct.

MY CODE

This is loosely based on an example I found in the developer forum and on the WWDC session video. I stripped it down to the bare minimum. I'm not sure that my MVC structure is any good. The model is in the AppDelegate which isn't ideal. Any suggestions to make it better are welcome.

1. Set the text inside all the labels
2. Ask for the width of all the labels with this new text
3. Resize all the labels with this new width
4. Move label2 to label1.x + label1.width, and so on

This is really the only way in iPhone for do that?

I came from Android and there is a ""wrap_content"" property for every view and ""relative_layouts"" where you can define something like.. put label2 rightOf label1. So I'm looking of something simple and automatic like that, but in iPhone.

Thanks!

I can do a transition with the same view, no problem, but I dont get it working trying to replace the view with a completly different view.

i need to...
1) take data from a field
2) convert it to a float
3) do some math
4) then plop the results in a label

i've gotten a version of this working where i pull the text from a filed and plop the results into a label upon clicking on a ""Calculate"" button, that was easy. so i know that points 1 and 4 are good. now for the tough part...

i've setup an initial version to ensure i can do points 3 and 4 by setting my float variables as static bits of data...

    float float_DiameterA, float_DiameterB;
    float myR1, myR2;
    
    float_DiameterA = 20;
    float_DiameterB = 5;
    	
    myR1=(float_DiameterA-float_DiameterB)/2;
    myR2=1;
    
    r1.text=[[NSNumber numberWithFloat:myR1] stringValue];
    r2.text=[[NSNumber numberWithFloat:myR2] stringValue];
    a1.text = txtLength.text;

results : r1 displays ""7.5"" and r2 displays ""1"". this works perfectly BUT i need to take txtDiameterA.text and put it into float_DiameterA as a floating point.

here's what i've tried for step 2...

    str_DiameterA = [txtDiameterA.text text];
    float_DiameterA = [[str_DiameterA text] floatValue];

but that didn't work ;-/

i've even tried several versions of
	if(EOF == sscanf(str_DiameterA, ""%f"", &float_DiameterA)){
		//error
	};
	
and 
	
	float_DiameterA = sscanf(txtDiameterA.text, ""%f"", &f);

but none of those worked either. i think that's when i started to realize this wasn't C++ as i thought it was lol...

think you'll get the idea by now.

so...

**how do you take the input from txtDiameterA.text and convert into a float?** please don't tell me to use Root Beer instead of a Cola lol.

oh, here's a few more bits of information that might have some impact...

    myR2=1;
    
    r1.text=[[NSNumber numberWithFloat:myR1] stringValue];
    r2.text=[[NSNumber numberWithFloat:myR2] stringValue];
    a1.text = txtLength.text;

results : r1 displays ""7.5"" and r2 displays ""1"". this works perfectly BUT i need to take txtDiameterA.text and put it into float_DiameterA as a floating point.

here's what i've tried for step 2...

    str_DiameterA = [txtDiameterA.text text];
    float_DiameterA = [[str_DiameterA text] floatValue];

but that didn't work ;-/

i've even tried several versions of
	if(EOF == sscanf(str_DiameterA, ""%f"", &float_DiameterA)){
		//error
	};
	
and 
	
	float_DiameterA = sscanf(txtDiameterA.text, ""%f"", &f);

but none of those worked either. i think that's when i started to realize this wasn't C++ as i thought it was lol...

think you'll get the idea by now.

so...

**how do you take the input from txtDiameterA.text and convert into a float?** please don't tell me to use Root Beer instead of a Cola lol.

oh, here's a few more bits of information that might have some impact...

part of my .h file

	IBOutlet UITextField *txtDiameterA;
	IBOutlet UITextField *txtDiameterB;
	
	IBOutlet UILabel *r1;
	IBOutlet UILabel *r2;

i designed my UI using the Interface Builder.

Perhaps even make it a ""one time install"" that automatically gets downloaded from the App Store the first time one downloads an app build with Mono Touch, making every subsequent Mono Touch app much lighter to download (without the runtime).

Doing so would be similar in a way to adding Bootcamp to OS X: it would make it easier for C# developers to join the party, but that wouldn't mean these developers will all stick to C#... What convinced me to buy a Mac is Bootcamp - I figured I could always install Windows if I didn't like OS X (and I liked the hardware, so no problem there). 6 months later, I'm using OS X full time...

Would there be any technical issues in doing so? I see only advantages for all parties, not one disadvantage to anyone (except maybe for the few unfortunate Apple employees who would have to test the crap out of the Mono Touch runtime before bundling it):

 - Novell wins because Mono Touch becomes much more viable (Mono Touch apps become much lighter all of the sudden)
 - Developers win because now there's one more tool in the tool belt
 - Many C# Developers would be very interested by this
 - Apple wins because that would bring even more attention to the platform, more revenue in developer fees, more potential great apps, etc
 - Users win because less space is used by different Apps having copies of the same runtime accumulating on their devices

    NSLog(@""%@"", myPrimaryinfo);

My plist looks like this:

    <?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?>
    <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC ""-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN"" ""http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"">
    <plist version=""1.0"">
    <array>
    	<string>Test string1</string>
    	<string>Test string2</string>
    	<string>Test string3</string>
    	<string>Test string4</string>
    </array>
    </plist>

Thanks in advance! :D

I have a basic memory issue I don't understand, that I'm sure just about any one of you will see in a second. I'm playing around, trying to learn various ways of using UIWebViews, getting strings from URLs, and so on. Specifically, I'm trying to obtain one URL from another. In other words, I have uploaded an html page to the web, containing a URL. The address for that page is coded into the app, giving me a ""hook"" into the app - I can change the contents of that page and send the app a new URL any time I want. Make sense?

So...retrieving the URL? No problem. Passing it into a string for later use - no problem. But when I set up a tap gesture recognizer, which should take that string, convert it back to an NSURL, and open it in Safari, I get a runtime crash. An NSLog call tells me that the string in question keeps being assigned to all sorts of random things.

The relevant bits of my code follow. I'm sure some of you will tell me there are much better ways to do what I want - and that's certainly welcome. But I'd also really love to know what I'm doing wrong for this particular implementation, as I'm sure it's a basic misunderstanding that I'd like to correct.

**Target the latest iOS release.** 

    Targeting the latest release allows you to take advantage of all the features 
    available in the latest version of iOS. However, this approach may offer a smaller 
    set of users capable of installing your application on their devices because your     
    application cannot run on iOS releases that are earlier than the target release.`

**Target an earlier iOS release.** 
        
    Targeting an earlier release lets you publish your application to a larger set of 
    users (because your application runs on the target OS release and later releases), 
    but may limit the iOS features your application can use.`

Right now, if my app is built for iOS5, which will work only on the iOS5 devices. And so, is it more advisable will have to launch the product in the iOS 4.3 version ?

When should I consider the launch of the app for iOS5 devices (1 week after ios5 is released, 1 month after ios5 is released ) ?? What about the methods in my app that are specific for ios5 ? should I change them back to ios4.3 ?

Kindly advise on the best practice that is being followed.

**Note:** *iOS5 is under NDA. This question does not involve any breach of contract as there is no specific question on the operation or methods of ios5 Beta. Please do not flag the question. The question is mainly for the best practice for application launches.*

    Targeting the latest release allows you to take advantage of all the features 
    available in the latest version of iOS. However, this approach may offer a smaller 
    set of users capable of installing your application on their devices because your

2. Enter text in 5 fields distributed in the top half of the page [basic stuff, I can do this]

4. Hit a button to either send PDF via e-mail [bare minimum] or print [ideal]
5. Hit a button to clear the form and start a new one

    2) This .nib file instantiates the Delegate object.
    3) When the appDidFinishLoading method runs, it generally initializes the UIViewController object.

I've been working on a number of apps over the last few months, some of which are just test ideas, some will eventually become real apps. I've submitted a few to the store (one a free one i did for a client, the other a paid app) 

in the case of the free app, i waited until the app was complete (from my perspective), and the client had signed off on it, and then allocated an app id (ie until this point the name was not decided, so there was little point in allocating an app id before then), and then generated a development profile, and assigned it to the app, generated a distribution profile and uploaded the app, it was approved, and i moved onto my next project.

with the paid app, (which is nearing completion) i decided for various reasons to decided on an app name, allocate an id, then generate an development & distribution profile, and upload the app, knowing it would not ""pass muster"", but to see if a few features that i had built into the app would cause it to be rejected, in which case the product as a whole would not be worth considering - i am not going to disclose what these features are here on this forum, lets just say they are borderline in terms of the app store guidelines, possibly acceptable, depending on the interpretation of those guidelines. :)

anyway, and there is question coming - it's clear from the names ""development profile"" and ""distribution profile"" that apple intend you to 

a) come up with an app name before you start writing code.<br>
b) register an app id based on that app name<br>
c) generate a development profile<br>
d) create your project with the app name, and assign the bundle id etc, install the ""development profile""<br>
e) begin development<br>
<br>
(some time later)<br>
<br>
f) generate a distribution profile<br>
g) upload the app, and get it accepted, possibly with some rewrites and bug fixes.<br>
e) sit back and wait for the pina coladas to be delivered to your poolside table (i jest)<br>

anyway. i'm curious to know how many people actually use this model?

the thing is, for an app to be successful, 70-95% of it is in fact the name of the app (imho). the name either needs to describe clearly and succinctly what the app does, or be interesting and catchy enough to get people to read the blurb, and download/buy it. sure it has to work, and look the part etc, but in most cases, the name of the app is a major part of the development process - you might not know what it is going to be called until just before completion.

if you do happen to come up with a ""killer name"", to go along with your ""killer app"", is it really that smart to give the game away to one of your potential competitors (apple?) if your app name says what it does, and it really is something so unique, just how long do you think it would take a team of wizz kids to duplicate the concept and beat you to the finish line?

on the flip side to that, i can see a ""pro"" in coming up with a name early and registering it as an app id, along with an app specific development profile (instead of just developing the app with the generic team distribution profile). when you do come to upload the app, it's clear it's something you have been working on for a while, and you didn't just happen to lift a bunch of source code files of someones macbook and rename it, and pass it off as your own.

and a FriendInfo Class that takes the id and gets all the info about this friend.

I thought I do it this way! 
Create an object of FriendsManager let it get all my friends (not really a problem),
in the FriendsManager create an Object of FriendInfo give it the id and let it get all the info I need including geocoding of hometown, and then save all this with core data!

I also do all the getting info & geocoding with grand central dispatch so do not really know when a FriendInfo got all the data it needs and is ready!

Unfortunately, all I get is this lousy error message from the attempt to invoke `insertTimeRange:ofAsset:atTime:error:`

What am I missing?

Why is it not possible to insert the item into the composition? 

When inspecting the `AVURLAsset` of that `AVPlayerItem` I also noticed that the tracks array is allocated but empty. Could that be the reason, and if so, how do I get the asset to properly hold valid tracks?

",iphone,crash,watchdog,,,12/06/2011 21:07:45,not a real question,1,1703,14,"iPhone App Fails to Launch in Time 8badf00d - Crash Log  PLEASE HELP!!! I have been searching for days on this topic and cannot come up with a straight answer on how to cut down on the launch time of my app.  Can anyone take a couple minutes to interpret this crash log for me (or teach me how)?  Cuz I have no clue and I have tried searching and even contacting Apple.  Thanks so much in advance.  This forum is amazing!

I tried [the method found here][1], but when I type in any of the memory addresses, the output is just that same memory address. Is this the most information I can get out of the crash logs, or is something wrong here?

I thought Xcode handles symbolicating the crash reports for me automatically? Why am I not getting any line numbers or methods? And why are my exception codes 0x00000000?

I tried [the method found here][1], but when I type in any of the memory addresses, the output is just that same memory address. Is this the most information I can get out of the crash logs, or is something wrong here?

I will be honest, I am a bit nervous as I come closer to being ready to release something.

**Legalities**
Yes, I understand you are presumably not a lawyer, and any advice given on the web should be discussed with a lawyer, but lets get at the basics...

1) If my app involves user data being stored on a database, am I at liberty to STOP offering this data? What if the cost of storing/accessing this data becomes much more than the profit from app sales and/or advertising? If the data is no longer accessible, the app is essentially worthless, is this legally problematic for me, or is it just a ""tough shit"" situation for the user.

2) Can I remove my app at any time for any reason? This is similar to question 1. What if I decide I am no longer passionate about the project? Am I in a lifetime of servitude to my users, who have now paid for this product? Furthermore, WHAT EXACTLY are users paying for, the app or the service it provides? Are they paying .99 cents for the app, which can access a database (assuming the database still exists) or are they paying .99 cents for the service to access a database.

3) Should I release an app under an LLC? I assume it would be beneficial to have liability on a company vs. an individual. To what extent will apple defend it's developers, if at all? What sort of protection for the developer is provided through the app store TOS?

4) Should I release an app with a TOS or disclaimer, relieving myself of responsibility for misuse, bugs, data security, etc? Is this even possible? Is is bad practice to force a new user into TOS before they even get to use the app or is this an ideal thing to do?

**Questions**

1) Is it more beneficial to offer a free app with designated ad space or an ad-free app with a price tag? More specifically, if the app is one that involves user data being stored remotely, is it better to have ads, that could potentially offer continual revenue, to help offset the costs of data management? I understand this may be an answer of opinion, but I would love to step aside and view the discussion between those with first-hand experience.

2) Related to question 1, would it be wise to release a first version of an app that ONLY stores user data on the device, especially if I am a new developer? I assume remote storage of local data could be offered in an update, if I found the app to be desirable and used in the first round. But at the same time, am I limiting the app in fear that it could become something I cannot handle to continue with my lower-level development skills? Opinions?

3) Does app usage and number-of-users generally coincide with the ability to afford data management? Do I NEED to have a bulletproof plan for the future in the event of an unexpected ""app is doing well"" situation, or should I just have fun and worry about that in the rare event that the app takes off?

4) My current apple developer account is a personal one. If I were to release under an llc, would it be best to just create a new developer account OR to contact apple to change the one I already have to reflect that I am a business, and use my business name.

I will be honest, I am a bit nervous as I come closer to being ready to release something.

**Legalities**
Yes, I understand you are presumably not a lawyer, and any advice given on the web should be discussed with a lawyer, but lets get at the basics...

1) If my app involves user data being stored on a database, am I at liberty to STOP offering this data? What if the cost of storing/accessing this data becomes much more than the profit from app sales and/or advertising? If the data is no longer accessible, the app is essentially worthless, is this legally problematic for me, or is it just a ""tough shit"" situation for the user.

I'll intercept the navigation events and directly integrate camera events, etc. 

I'd like to have a nice, clean, tiny HTML framework for these pages. Currently I'm using Bootstrap/Twitter for the web site proper, and started to use that for the content in the UIWebViews, but it's not really mean for that purpose (yes, I could use the fluid layout, but I know exactly what each presentation should be... besides I'd then have to hack out all of the unnecessary styles). I would love to use something like jQueryMobile, but that is way too heavy for my needs. 

My question is: can you recommend a good, very lightwight html/css template to use for iOS that renders similar to jQM, but without all of the jquery & javascript? I want me presentation to be clean and crisp and most definitely FAST. I don't need any of the javascript for animations or transitions as I'll be handling that directly on the device. 

I am familiar with a lot of the major frameworks out there that are intended to be used with PhoneGap. But I don't need all of those features. Just the markup. For example, I wouldn't use sencha because of this (the server side will emit exactly what is necessary). I seem to recall that there is another jQM alternative in alpha right now, but my googling skilz have failed me.

Here is a collection of common questions and their answers. Feel free to edit and add your own.

*I obviously learnt all this information from somewhere too. Various forum posts, StackOverflow answers and my own experimenting brought me to all these solutions. Credit goes to those who posted some sample code that I've since used and modified. I don't remember who you all are - but hats off to you!*

## How Do I Select An Image From the User's Images or From the Camera? ##

You use `UIImagePickerController`. The documentation for the class gives a decent overview of how one would use it, and can be found [here][1].

Basically, you create an instance of the class, which is a modal view controller, display it, and set yourself (or some class) to be the delegate. Then you'll get notified when a user selects some form of media (movie or image in 3.0 on the 3GS), and you can do whatever you want.

## My Delegate Was Called - How Do I Get The Media? ##
The delegate function signature is the following:
	
	-(void)imagePickerController:(UIImagePickerController *)picker didFinishPickingMediaWithInfo:(NSDictionary *)info;
	
You should put a breakpoint in the debugger to see what's in the dictionary, but you use that to extract the media. For example:
	
	UIImage* image = [info valueForKey:@""UIImagePickerControllerOriginalImage""];
	
There are other keys that work as well. You can figure them out by looking in the debugger.

## OK, I Got The Image, But It Doesn't Have Any Geolocation Data. What gives? ##
Unfortunately, Apple decided that we're not worthy of this information. When they load the data into the `UIImage`, they strip it of all the EXIF/Geolocation data.

## Can I Get To The Original File Representing This Image on the Disk? ##
Nope. For security purposes, you only get the `UIImage`.

## How Do I Modify The Pixels of the `UIImage`? ##
The `UIImage` is immutable, meaning you can't change it. However, you can get a copy of the pixels in order to modify them. One method is the following:

	UIImage* image = ...; // An image
	NSData* pixelData = (NSData*) CGDataProviderCopyData(CGImageGetDataProvider(image.CGImage));
	void* pixelBytes = [pixelData bytes];
	
	// Take away the red pixel, assuming 32-bit RGBA
	for(int i = 0; i < [pixelData length]; i += 4) {
	        bytes[i] = 0; // red
	        bytes[i+1] = bytes[i+1]; // green
	        bytes[i+2] = bytes[i+2]; // blue
	        bytes[i+3] = bytes[i+3]; // alpha
	}

And if you wanted to create a new image using these pixels, you can do:
	NSData* newPixelData = [NSData dataWithBytes:pixelBytes length:[pixelData length]];
	UIImage* newImage = [UIImage imageWithData:newPixelData]; // Huzzah
	
There are other ways, and Apple wrote a very nice article that goes over the various methods. You can find it [here][2].

## After I Select 3 Images From The Camera, I Run Out Of Memory. Help! ##
You have to remember that even though on disk these images take up only a few hundred kilobytes at most, that's because they're compressed as a PNG or JPG. When they are loaded into the `UIImage`, they become uncompressed. A quick over-the-envelope calculation would be:

	width x height x 4 = bytes in memory
	
That's assuming 32-bit pixels. If you have 16-bit pixels (some JPGs are stored as RGBA-5551), then you'd replace the `4` with a `2`. 

Now, images taken with the camera are `1600 x 1200` pixels, so let's do the math:

	1600 x 1200 x 4 = 7,680,000 bytes = ~8 MB
	
8 MB is a lot, especially when you have a limit of around 24 MB for your application. That's why you run out of memory.

## OK, I Understand Why I Have No Memory. What Do I Do? ##
There is never any reason to **display** images at their full resolution. The iPhone has a screen of `480 x 320` pixels, so you're just wasting space. If you find yourself in this situation, ask yourself the following question: Do I need the full resolution image?

If the answer is yes, then you should save it to disk for later use.

If the answer is no, then read the next part.

Once you've decided what to do with the full-resolution image, then you need to create a smaller image to use for displaying. Many times you might even want several sizes for your image: a thumbnail, a full-size one for displaying, and the original full-resolution image.

## OK, I'm Hooked. How Do I Resize the Image? ##
Unfortunately, there is no defined way how to resize an image. Also, it's important to note that when you resize it, you'll get a new image - you're not modifying the old one.

There are a couple of methods to do the resizing. I'll present them both here, and explain the pros and cons of each.

**Method 1: Using UIKit Functions**

	+ (UIImage*)imageWithImage:(UIImage*)image scaledToSize:(CGSize)newSize;
	{
		// Create a graphics image context
		UIGraphicsBeginImageContext(newSize);
		
		// Tell the old image to draw in this new context, with the desired
		// new size
		[image drawInRect:CGRectMake(0,0,newSize.width,newSize.height)];
		
		// Get the new image from the context
		UIImage* newImage = UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext();
		
		// End the context
		UIGraphicsEndImageContext();
			
		// Return the new image.
		return newImage;
	}

This method is very simple, and works great. It will also deal with the UIImageOrientation for you, meaning that you don't have to care whether the camera was sideways when the picture was taken. **However**, this method is not thread safe, and since thumbnailing is a relatively expensive operation (approximately ~2.5s on a 3G for a `1600 x 1200` pixel image), this is very much an operation you may want to do in the background, on a separate thread.

**Method 1: Using CoreGraphics Functions**
	+ (UIImage*)imageWithImage:(UIImage*)sourceImage scaledToSize:(CGSize)newSize;
	{
		CGFloat targetWidth = targetSize.width;
		CGFloat targetHeight = targetSize.height;
			
		CGImageRef imageRef = [sourceImage CGImage];
		CGBitmapInfo bitmapInfo = CGImageGetBitmapInfo(imageRef);
		CGColorSpaceRef colorSpaceInfo = CGImageGetColorSpace(imageRef);
		
		if (bitmapInfo == kCGImageAlphaNone) {
			bitmapInfo = kCGImageAlphaNoneSkipLast;
		}
		
		CGContextRef bitmap;
		
		if (sourceImage.imageOrientation == UIImageOrientationUp || sourceImage.imageOrientation == UIImageOrientationDown) {
			bitmap = CGBitmapContextCreate(NULL, targetWidth, targetHeight, CGImageGetBitsPerComponent(imageRef), CGImageGetBytesPerRow(imageRef), colorSpaceInfo, bitmapInfo);
			
		} else {
			bitmap = CGBitmapContextCreate(NULL, targetHeight, targetWidth, CGImageGetBitsPerComponent(imageRef), CGImageGetBytesPerRow(imageRef), colorSpaceInfo, bitmapInfo);
			
		}	
		
		if (sourceImage.imageOrientation == UIImageOrientationLeft) {
			CGContextRotateCTM (bitmap, radians(90));
			CGContextTranslateCTM (bitmap, 0, -targetHeight);
			
		} else if (sourceImage.imageOrientation == UIImageOrientationRight) {
			CGContextRotateCTM (bitmap, radians(-90));
			CGContextTranslateCTM (bitmap, -targetWidth, 0);
			
		} else if (sourceImage.imageOrientation == UIImageOrientationUp) {
			// NOTHING
		} else if (sourceImage.imageOrientation == UIImageOrientationDown) {
			CGContextTranslateCTM (bitmap, targetWidth, targetHeight);
			CGContextRotateCTM (bitmap, radians(-180.));
		}
		
		CGContextDrawImage(bitmap, CGRectMake(0, 0, targetWidth, targetHeight), imageRef);
		CGImageRef ref = CGBitmapContextCreateImage(bitmap);
		UIImage* newImage = [UIImage imageWithCGImage:ref];
		
		CGContextRelease(bitmap);
		CGImageRelease(ref);
		
		return newImage; 
	}
	
	The benefit of this method is that it is thread-safe, plus it takes care of all the small things (using correct color space and bitmap info, dealing with image orientation) that the UIKit version does.
	
## How Do I Resize and Maintain Aspect Ratio (like the AspectFill option)? ##
It is very similar to the method above, and it looks like this:

	+ (UIImage*)imageWithImage:(UIImage*)sourceImage scaledToSizeWithSameAspectRatio:(CGSize)newSize;
	{  
		CGSize imageSize = sourceImage.size;
		CGFloat width = imageSize.width;
		CGFloat height = imageSize.height;
		CGFloat targetWidth = targetSize.width;
		CGFloat targetHeight = targetSize.height;
		CGFloat scaleFactor = 0.0;
		CGFloat scaledWidth = targetWidth;
		CGFloat scaledHeight = targetHeight;
		CGPoint thumbnailPoint = CGPointMake(0.0,0.0);
		
		if (CGSizeEqualToSize(imageSize, targetSize) == NO) {
	        CGFloat widthFactor = targetWidth / width;
	        CGFloat heightFactor = targetHeight / height;
			
	        if (widthFactor > heightFactor) {
				scaleFactor = widthFactor; // scale to fit height
			}
	        else {
				scaleFactor = heightFactor; // scale to fit width
			}
			
	        scaledWidth  = width * scaleFactor;
	        scaledHeight = height * scaleFactor;
			
	        // center the image
	        if (widthFactor > heightFactor)	{
				thumbnailPoint.y = (targetHeight - scaledHeight) * 0.5; 
			}
	        else if (widthFactor < heightFactor) {
				thumbnailPoint.x = (targetWidth - scaledWidth) * 0.5;
			}
		}     
		
		CGImageRef imageRef = [sourceImage CGImage];
		CGBitmapInfo bitmapInfo = CGImageGetBitmapInfo(imageRef);
		CGColorSpaceRef colorSpaceInfo = CGImageGetColorSpace(imageRef);
		
		if (bitmapInfo == kCGImageAlphaNone) {
			bitmapInfo = kCGImageAlphaNoneSkipLast;
		}
		
		CGContextRef bitmap;
		
		if (sourceImage.imageOrientation == UIImageOrientationUp || sourceImage.imageOrientation == UIImageOrientationDown) {
			bitmap = CGBitmapContextCreate(NULL, targetWidth, targetHeight, CGImageGetBitsPerComponent(imageRef), CGImageGetBytesPerRow(imageRef), colorSpaceInfo, bitmapInfo);
			
		} else {
			bitmap = CGBitmapContextCreate(NULL, targetHeight, targetWidth, CGImageGetBitsPerComponent(imageRef), CGImageGetBytesPerRow(imageRef), colorSpaceInfo, bitmapInfo);
			
		}	
		
		// In the right or left cases, we need to switch scaledWidth and scaledHeight,
		// and also the thumbnail point
		if (sourceImage.imageOrientation == UIImageOrientationLeft) {
			thumbnailPoint = CGPointMake(thumbnailPoint.y, thumbnailPoint.x);
			CGFloat oldScaledWidth = scaledWidth;
			scaledWidth = scaledHeight;
			scaledHeight = oldScaledWidth;
			
			CGContextRotateCTM (bitmap, radians(90));
			CGContextTranslateCTM (bitmap, 0, -targetHeight);
			
		} else if (sourceImage.imageOrientation == UIImageOrientationRight) {
			thumbnailPoint = CGPointMake(thumbnailPoint.y, thumbnailPoint.x);
			CGFloat oldScaledWidth = scaledWidth;
			scaledWidth = scaledHeight;
			scaledHeight = oldScaledWidth;
			
			CGContextRotateCTM (bitmap, radians(-90));
			CGContextTranslateCTM (bitmap, -targetWidth, 0);
			
		} else if (sourceImage.imageOrientation == UIImageOrientationUp) {
			// NOTHING
		} else if (sourceImage.imageOrientation == UIImageOrientationDown) {
			CGContextTranslateCTM (bitmap, targetWidth, targetHeight);
			CGContextRotateCTM (bitmap, radians(-180.));
		}
		
		CGContextDrawImage(bitmap, CGRectMake(thumbnailPoint.x, thumbnailPoint.y, scaledWidth, scaledHeight), imageRef);
		CGImageRef ref = CGBitmapContextCreateImage(bitmap);
		UIImage* newImage = [UIImage imageWithCGImage:ref];
		
		CGContextRelease(bitmap);
		CGImageRelease(ref);
		
		return newImage; 
	}
	
The method we employ here is to create a bitmap with the desired size, but draw an image that is actually larger, thus maintaining the aspect ratio.

## So We've Got Our Scaled Images - How Do I Save Them To Disk? ##
This is pretty simple. Remember that we want to save a compressed version to disk, and not the uncompressed pixels. Apple provides two functions that help us with this (documentation is [here][3]):

	NSData* UIImagePNGRepresentation(UIImage *image);
	NSData* UIImageJPEGRepresentation (UIImage *image, CGFloat compressionQuality);
	
And if you want to use them, you'd do something like:

	UIImage* myThumbnail = ...; // Get some image
	NSData* imageData = UIImagePNGRepresentation(myThumbnail);
	
Now we're ready to save it to disk, which is the final step (say into the documents directory):

	// Give a name to the file
	NSString* imageName = ""MyImage.png"";
	
	// Now, we have to find the documents directory so we can save it
	// Note that you might want to save it elsewhere, like the cache directory,
	// or something similar.
	NSArray* paths = NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains(NSDocumentDirectory, NSUserDomainMask, YES);
	NSString* documentsDirectory = [paths objectAtIndex:0];
	
	// Now we get the full path to the file
	NSString* fullPathToFile = [documentsDirectory stringByAppendingPathComponent:imageName];
	
	// and then we write it out
	[imageData writeToFile:fullPathToFile atomically:NO];
	
You would repeat this for every version of the image you have.

## How Do I Load These Images Back Into Memory? ##
Just look at the various `UIImage` static initialization functions, such as `imageWithContentsOfFile:` in the Apple [documentation][3].

The method we employ here is to create a bitmap with the desired size, but draw an image that is actually larger, thus maintaining the aspect ratio.

## So We've Got Our Scaled Images - How Do I Save Them To Disk? ##
This is pretty simple. Remember that we want to save a compressed version to disk, and not the uncompressed pixels. Apple provides two functions that help us with this (documentation is [here][3]):

	NSData* UIImagePNGRepresentation(UIImage *image);
	NSData* UIImageJPEGRepresentation (UIImage *image, CGFloat compressionQuality);
	
And if you want to use them, you'd do something like:

	UIImage* myThumbnail = ...; // Get some image
	NSData* imageData = UIImagePNGRepresentation(myThumbnail);
	
Now we're ready to save it to disk, which is the final step (say into the documents directory):

	// Give a name to the file
	NSString* imageName = ""MyImage.png"";
	
	// Now, we have to find the documents directory so we can save it
	// Note that you might want to save it elsewhere, like the cache directory,
	// or something similar.
	NSArray* paths = NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains(NSDocumentDirectory, NSUserDomainMask, YES);
	NSString* documentsDirectory = [paths objectAtIndex:0];
	
	// Now we get the full path to the file
	NSString* fullPathToFile = [documentsDirectory stringByAppendingPathComponent:imageName];
	
	// and then we write it out
	[imageData writeToFile:fullPathToFile atomically:NO];
	
You would repeat this for every version of the image you have.

## How Do I Load These Images Back Into Memory? ##
Just look at the various `UIImage` static initialization functions, such as `imageWithContentsOfFile:` in the Apple [documentation][3].

What I want to do is add a cell, like in this video at about 0:12 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAebrhW3SHg

In this example, a new cell just pops right out when the add button is pushed. How can I do this?",4

It appears that the controller is not releasing its subviews when it is dealloc'd.  I placed NSLog messages in all of the subview's dealloc method as well as the view controller.  The view controller dealloc gets called but the subview's do not.  However, if I then push another instance of that view controller on to the navigation stack, it appears that all of the subviews of the previous instance are then released (I get a bunch of NSLog messages in the console letting me know).  I've check and I have no separate reference to the custom view controller in the presenting view controller (the one that's doing the pushing).

One small (maybe) detail: The custom view controller does receive a block it stores and then executes before popping.  However, I did send nil to it and I get the same behavior.  Plus, the presenting view controller does dealloc when popped of the stack, so no retain cycle.

Also, I did try explicitly releasing each view in the dealloc method of the custom view controller.  Same behavior.

Is it possible the navigation controller would be holding on to it?  It doesn't seem to do this to any of my other view controllers.

My problem is that this does represent a memory leak (of all those subviews) though the leak doesn't stack, it's still a leak.

This routine dumps the view hierarchy to NSLog starting at the view passed in. Subviews show their index in the subviews array and all super classes in order separated by a colon with the frame size at the end. 

To dump the entire view hierarchy of your application, call the method like this:

    dumpViews([[UIApplication sharedApplication] keyWindow], @"""", @"""");

To display the hierarchy of the the camera view, override this method in your controller:

    navigationController:willShowViewController:viewController:animated

and call the dump routine like this:

    dumpViews(self.modalViewController.view, @"""", @"""");

For all other views:

    dumpViews(myView, @"""", @"""");

What is wrong with this method? Becase there are libraries like WSDL2ObjC which creates code from my wsdl, or cSOAP which is a client/server SOAP library. 

Is the only point of using a SOAP library is that I dont need to write the classes that my XML will be parsed into? with my aprroach above it only seems like after parsing the xml everything will be ok, or I am missing something?

I used the recommended fork of the facebook api and tried the latest from:

My problem starts with the following error:
    
    < failure xmlns=""urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xmpp-sasl"">< not-authorized/></failure>

The error is a reply from facebook to xmppframework s response to a authentication challenge. The response that is made by the iphone is base64 encoded msg when i decode it i find 2 of the values are null:
api_key=(null)
and the
session_key=(null)

This is obviously the reason facebook is returning that error. But the problem i have is i cant seem to find any where to set these values in the framework. Besides i think the session_key should be pulled in from facebook anyway.

I guess what i want to know is a couple of things. 

Has any one got the xmppframework working with facebook on a iDevice? 

If you have got it working did you have to stray from the path of the instructions on http://code.google.com/p/xmppframework/wiki/FacebookChatHowTo   ?

I need to create an app, like the amazon app or any other app which deals with selling items and is just an (smartphone) extension of their core business(internet sales). Now I'm sure given enough time I could cobble something together that works, but if I'm going to do this I want to do it as right as possible the first time :)

My question is where do I start? (sorry, that was the broad part) But really I'm looking for as much advice as possible, I don't want anyone to write the code for me, but I've read some books now and my biggest problem is deciding on an approach to this, i.e. what I should be using for identification, loading in the stock, handling the actual orders the general things you come across when buying online.

So my real question, is more a cry for advice on which techniques I should be using for the different parts(mentioned above), things to read that can help me, tutorials, books etc. anything you can think of relevant to helping me sleep at night :)

Many, many thanks in advance for any help I can get

as a note, I should mention I already have the following books:

3. or apple also takes some share of the money.

Is there any other way to so the same thing taking out the option of App Store.

Another query:

1. If I have Standard License and I wanted to keep the application on App Store, but only want to allow Enterprise specific customers to download the application ? is it possible?
2. Is there any kind of secured download on App Store.

In case there is no internet connection I would like to show cache results of the last time we had internet connection and the tables were updated.

I'm using NSURLCache for that like so:


NSURLRequest *theRequest = [NSURLRequest requestWithURL:[NSURL URLWithString:xmlLink]
            cachePolicy:NSURLRequestReturnCacheDataElseLoad timeoutInterval:60];
 
 NSURLCache *sharedCache = [NSURLCache sharedURLCache];

 } else {
  NSLog(@""Didn't got Response"");  
 }

 self.objectFeedConnection = [[[NSURLConnection alloc] initWithRequest:theRequest               delegate:self startImmediately:YES] autorelease];

I can see that for the first time the response is Didn't got response since it's the first time visit.
I can also see that the response is being cached, since i implemented the willCacheResponse method like so:

- (NSCachedURLResponse *) connection:(NSURLConnection *)connection 
       willCacheResponse:(NSCachedURLResponse *)cachedResponse
{
    NSLog(@""willCache Reponse""); 
    NSCachedURLResponse *newCachedResponse = nil;    
    if ([[[[cachedResponse response] URL] scheme] isEqual:@""http""]) {
  newCachedResponse = [[[NSCachedURLResponse alloc]
                initWithResponse:[cachedResponse response]
                data:[cachedResponse data]
                userInfo:nil
                storagePolicy:[cachedResponse storagePolicy]]
                autorelease];
    }
   return newCachedResponse;
}


The second time i visit this site i can clearly see that NSLog spits out Got Response from cache that mean that there was a hit, hence willCacheResponse should not be called again, but for some strange reason it is called again and again and does not pull the information out of the cache, it try to cache it again.

Any idea what causing this issue ?

Workflow lets users take pictures of sheets of paper while I will afterwards detect corners/the outline so I know the 4 corner points of the original sheet of paper in the photograph. It then is easy to inverse the perspective transformation of the camera to gain a ""flat"" image of the photographed sheet of paper. However, my question is how do I maintain or even calculate the correct (original) aspect ratio?

[Image of UI with detected corners of sheet of paper (can't post images, sorry)][1]

As you can see above I have the coordinates for the corner points and I also know how to construct a matrix to map the top left corner to the point (0,0), the top right corner to (width,0), the bottom right corner to (width, height) and the bottom left corner to (0,height). The question now is: How do I get the correct width/height aspect ratio the sheet of paper originally has. I'm pretty sure I can figure it out using the angles to determine the perspective transformation but I'm stuck finding the right formula. I also have a hunch that I also would need the focal length of the camera but it would be great not to need that.

Any ideas would be appreciated.

How do I make sure the PolygonViewController's aPolygon is the same(instance) as polygon created in mainController?

I tried to add `@property Polygon* aPolygon;` to PolygonViewController then in MainController I did `polygonViewController.aPolygon = polygon;` However, aPolygon in PolygonViewController awakeFromNib method is always null.

Really, I'll have to load another image, but the effect I'm looking for is exactly like Google's Street View transition.  

In Street View, you see somewhere in the distance you want to go to, you click to ""zoom"" to that area, and the transition is basically:
- Blur current image
- Stretch bottom image
- Load new image behind (looks like the top half of the image view is the new image, and the bottom half of the image view is the old image)
- Unblur (sharpen) the new image

I'll be doing this transition using vector artwork creating in Adobe Illustrator, so I can make the original images as big as needed.  I just don't know how to perform the actual transition.  I want it to appear to the user that they touch inside the image to ""zoom to the next hill"" but I need to actually load another image with new artwork on it.

Can I do this with one UIImageView?  Or will I need two to accomplish the effect?  Is it even possible to do like Google's transition?

    -(UIImage *)renderToImage;

That does a lot of rendering work and returns me an image. This includes the generation of FBOs, textures, etc.

Lately, I've found myself needing to enhance this. The image generation takes four seconds, so I want to pass off the work to another thread and let the app continue. This seemed simple enough. I made a method with this code:

    -(void) generateRandomNewImage:(MyViewController *)evc{
	UIImage * renderedImage = [self renderToImage];
	NSString * fileLoc = [self writeToTempFile:renderedImage];
	NSLog(@""File location:%@"",fileLoc);
	[evc performSelectorOnMainThread:@selector(imageGenerationComplete:) withObject:fileLoc waitUntilDone:NO];
    }

Hopefully you can see the logic going on here. This method renders the image, saves it to the filesystem, and calls a method on the main thread's viewcontroller to let it know the file is ready. This code is inside my opengl renderer. It's called here, in the main thread's viewcontroller:

                               object:self];
    [thread start];

To me, that seems fine too. When I run this code, I get told in my console that my framebuffer object status were error'ed, with a status of zero. I have no idea why. As a result, I get a blank image (saving to the temp files work, by the way, I've tested them).

To test, I put all of this code into the main thread, didn't create any new threads or anything. It all worked fine. As soon as I try and pass off the image generation to another thread, I hit problems.

Navigating using the back button is working normally.  Is this a bug, or am I doing something wrong?",iphone,ios,monotouch,,,,open,0,229,7,"app crashes when handling navbar button event In my app, I have a navbar button that allows the user to pop back to the top of the navigation stack.  This has been there for a while and has been working fine.  However, when I build with MT 4.0 it crashes.

    # in constructor
    UIButton btn = UIButton.FromType(UIButtonType.Custom);
    btn.Frame = new RectangleF(0,0,29,29);
    btn.SetBackgroundImage(UIImage.FromFile(""images/Home_button.png""),UIControlState.Normal);
    btn.TouchDown += delegate {
      this.NavigationController.PopToRootViewController(true);
    };
    UIBarButtonItem bar = new UIBarButtonItem(btn);
    this.NavigationItem.RightBarButtonItem = bar;			

The button is drawn correctly, but the app crashes when the button is pressed.  If I change the delegate to just do a Console.WriteLine() it still crashes.

As far as I can tell, this was working up until I installed MT 4.0.

The exception it shows when it crashes is

I initialize topViewController(initWithNibName), resize the view to 70% of the height and add the topViewController.view to  containerView subviews

Similarly for BottomView, except that the height is 30%

These 2 views now span the height of the container view.


However, the bar plot drawn in the bottom view does not respect the super views height coordinates and draws the bars out of range resulting in the need for a vertical scroll. I've also tried adjusting the plotScale post addition of graph, but causes me to lose some alignment.

Strangely, the scatter chart view in the top view seems to behave better and scales when i flip  the top: bottom ratio to 3:7 from the original 7:3.


Are bar plots supposed to behave differently ? Or am i missing something here. Attached are the images for my issue. notice that in both cases , the top scatter chart seems to have scaled correctly.

Also, i tested by using the scatter chart code in the bottomViewController (to make sure that this wasn't some nib issue) and again with scatter chart the scaling seems to just work.

Thanks a lot.

Are bar plots supposed to behave differently ? Or am i missing something here. Attached are the images for my issue. notice that in both cases , the top scatter chart seems to have scaled correctly.

Also, i tested by using the scatter chart code in the bottomViewController (to make sure that this wasn't some nib issue) and again with scatter chart the scaling seems to just work.

Thanks a lot.

PS: i didn't use google groups because i could not post images there.

I need to be able to navigate through a number of views, during which I can send and receive data asynchronously. The goal is to have the app automatically update data in real time.

What I'd like to do is have a separate socket manager class inheriting from NSObject that has the delegate functions of CocoaAsyncSocket plus some helper functions, and then when stuff happens with the persistent socket, that is handled within the class and it sends out notifications that have different effects depending on which view you are currently on.

What is the preferred way of doing this? Set up a protocol for this socket manager and have every UI view be a delegate*? Or would I be better off having the socket manager sit in a background thread and send notifications? Is there a preferred choice vis a vis battery life?

I can successfully create apps using audio graphs including mixers and applying effects, create callbacks, render music from individual songs or input from the microphone, but I have not figured out how to access the iPod music stream.

I want to apply FFT to the music stream for further analysis and to pass the music through to the output without further modification--no effects changing the audio stream--just a pass through, if that matters. I want the FFT rendering to occur when the iPod music player is playing and stop when the player stops, i.e., the iPod controls when the rendering occurs.

The Apple AddMusic example mixes an audio stream with an iPod music stream, but I could not see that the iPod music was exposed in any way that provided a means to extract the iPod music data for rendering.

Jeroen van Rijn's //mobile.tutsplus.com/tutorials/iphone/ios-sdk-music-library-access/ is an example Music Player app that plays iPod music that can be controlled by either the Music Player app or the iPhone iPod app. That app or the iPod app selects one or more songs and plays them to the iPhone speakers. I can get callbacks to execute in that app up to the AudioUnitRender method, but the callback audio buffers are empty. I can not figure out the approach needed to populate the buffers with audio data for the AudioUnitRender to function.

My rather vague question is ""how to access the music stream played by the Music Player/iPod and process that music stream by a render callback""? After rendering, I want to pass the music on to the speakers or other selected output device. What is the approach for accessing the music data? Audio Units and Audio Graphs, or iPodAssetReader, or some other approach? Circular buffers seem to be an approach for processing a continuous stream of music but I do not know the specific location where/how to access the iPod music data stream to pass to the callback.

I have a `CardModel` (NSObject) that has some integer properties to hold data, and a `Deck` (NSObject) that has an array to hold a bunch of `CardModels` and then a `CardView` (UIView) that has a `CardModel` as a property that I make when I select a `CardModel` from a `Deck`.  And then I've got a bunch of `UIViewControllers` that I move around on a `UINavigationController`.

My question is about where and when to use the `@class` compiler directive.

If I subclass a `UIViewController` by making a new file and subclassing it, should I use the `@class MyViewController` in the header of `MyViewController.h` or `.m` and does it go in the header of the file that actually uses the controller (like when one controller is going to instantiate another controller type and push it to the stack).  Or do I need to use it at all?  Is it only required if I actually add new properties to my class beyond what's in the stock implementation?

6222142,06/03/2011 01:36:57,683387,03/30/2011 06:19:28,3,0,Using CGDataProviderCreateWithData callback,"I'm using CGDataProviderCreateWithData to (eventually) create a UIImage from a malloced array of bytes.  I call CGDataProviderCreateWithData like this:

     provider = CGDataProviderCreateWithData(NULL, dataPtr, dataLen, callbackFunc);

where 

dataPtr is the previously malloced array of data bytes for the image,
dataLen is the number of bytes in the dataPtr array, and
callbackFunc is as described in the CGDataProviderCreateWithData documentation:

     void callbackFunc(void *info, const void *data, size_t size);

The callback function is called when the data provider is released so I could free() dataPtr there, but I may want to continue using it (dataPtr) and at some later stage free it.  This block of code will be called multiple times, and the flow will look something like:

1. malloc(dataPtr)
2. create image (call CGDataProviderCreateWithData etc)
3. display image
4. release image (and so release data provider created by CGDataProviderCreateWithData)
5. continue to use dataPtr
6. free(dataPtr)

so 1..6 may be executed multiple times.  I don't want dataPtr hanging around for the entire execution of the program (and it may change in size anyway), so I want to malloc/free it as necessary.

The problem is that I can't free(dataPtr) in the callback from CGDataProviderCreateWithData because I still want to use it, so I want to free it some time later - and I can't free it until I know that the data provider no longer needs it (as far as I can tell CGDataProviderCreateWithData uses the array I pass, it doesn't take a copy).  

I can't do (1) above until I know it is ok to free and re-malloc dataPtr, so what I really want to do is block waiting for the data provider to be freed (well, I want to know whether I should re-enter the 1..6 block of code, which I can't do until the data provider is freed).  It will be - I create the data provider, create the image and immediately display it and release the data provider.  The trouble is that the data provider isn't actually released until the UIImage is released and is finished with it.

",iphone,objective-c,,,,,open,0,352,3,"Using CGDataProviderCreateWithData callback I'm using CGDataProviderCreateWithData to (eventually) create a UIImage from a malloced array of bytes.  I call CGDataProviderCreateWithData like this:

     provider = CGDataProviderCreateWithData(NULL, dataPtr, dataLen, callbackFunc);

where 

dataPtr is the previously malloced array of data bytes for the image,
dataLen is the number of bytes in the dataPtr array, and
callbackFunc is as described in the CGDataProviderCreateWithData documentation:

     void callbackFunc(void *info, const void *data, size_t size);

The callback function is called when the data provider is released so I could free() dataPtr there, but I may want to continue using it (dataPtr) and at some later stage free it.  This block of code will be called multiple times, and the flow will look something like:

1. malloc(dataPtr)
2. create image (call CGDataProviderCreateWithData etc)
3. display image
4. release image (and so release data provider created by CGDataProviderCreateWithData)
5. continue to use dataPtr
6. free(dataPtr)

so 1..6 may be executed multiple times.  I don't want dataPtr hanging around for the entire execution of the program (and it may change in size anyway), so I want to malloc/free it as necessary.

The problem is that I can't free(dataPtr) in the callback from CGDataProviderCreateWithData because I still want to use it, so I want to free it some time later - and I can't free it until I know that the data provider no longer needs it (as far as I can tell CGDataProviderCreateWithData uses the array I pass, it doesn't take a copy).

I have been able to get a MIDI to play, so my sequence is there and populated with something useful but I can't seem to get access to the tracks (or in this case track, as there is only one music track, the other is a tempo track).

If I run a MusicSequenceGetTrackCount on ""mySequence"" I get a return of 2; this is expected.

If I run a MusicSequenceGetInfoDictionary, it returns 3 entries:

    Printing description of sequenceInfo:
    {
        tempo = 120;
        ""time signature"" = ""4/4"";
        title = ""RHand"";
    }

This makes sense since all of this info matches up with my track.

So, all of this would make me think if I use the method MusicSequenceGetIndTrack(MusicSequence inSequence, UInt32 inTrackIndex, MusicTrack *outTrack) I should be able to output the track so I can make some modification.

Here's my code so far. If anyone could take a look and see where I'm going wrong, that'd be great. Also, if anyone has some good resources about using MusicPlayer, I'd be really grateful. Thanks.

1. Send items that need to sync from iPhone to website
2. Add items to website MySql database
3. Send back items that need to sync from website to iPhone
4. Add items on iPhone Sqlite database

All this is done using one request to the server. Often the user just have a few items (<20) to sync but sometimes a user might have 2000 items to sync. Adding 2000 items to a MySql database can take some time. I'm using transactions and commit on the website when adding the items, something like this:

    mysqlTransaction.BeginTransaction();
    foreach item sent from iPhone
    {
        mysql.CommandText = //Sql query
        mysql.ExecuteNonQuery();
    }
    mysqlTransaction.Commit();

Sometimes when a user have a lot of items to add, this can take a veeery long time. My idea is therefore to change the sync procedure a little bit and instead of using one large request I divide the request into chunks, maybe sending and recieiving 50 items at a time.

I'm not sure if i'm doing it right. Because i don't get a result back in 'output' like ""MinMax"" to get the positions of the found match... Am i even passing the right variables to the matchTemplate function...??

Anyway, can someone please tell me what i'm doing wrong and how to make this work?


Thanks for any help!",4
