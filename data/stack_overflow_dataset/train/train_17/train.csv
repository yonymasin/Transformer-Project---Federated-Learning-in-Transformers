I've tried this [HTML5 Outliner][3] and I know that it is functional from outlining other HTML5 pages I've found on the Internet.  

The trouble with it is that this doesn't work on all pages (mainly the ones I have written for a Wordpress theme), and the error messages are cryptic; they seem to refer to the problem element in question (`<section>` for example), but don't do much to specify which element it is talking about on the page; i.e. specifying a line number, like the [validator][4] does.

I've found some other [programs][5] that are capable of reading html5 outlines, but I'm concerned that [they][6] may be early implementations that may be out of date for the current HTML5 spec.

So I was wondering if there was another program, website, etc, with more concise error messages that I could test my pages to ensure that I (a beginner in HTML5) is creating a document outline that could be properly read by tools capable of reading HTML5 document outlines.

>##HTML5 Websockets

###HTML5 Websockets?
WebSocket is a technology providing for bi-directional, full-duplex communications channels, over a single Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) socket. It is designed to be implemented in web browsers and web servers but it can be used by any client or server application. The WebSocket API is being standardized by the W3C and the WebSocket protocol is being standardized by the IETF. Since ordinary TCP connections to ports other than 80 are frequently blocked by administrators outside of home environments it can be used as a way to overcome these restrictions and provide similar functionality with some additional protocol overhead while multiplexing several WebSocket services over a single TCP port.

Used source: [Wikipedia][1]

You can find the official W3C documentation about HTML5 Websockets [here][2].

---
###Why this new technology?
This technology is invented to enable programmers to create interactive real-time webapplications, quickly and reliably.

---
###Browser support
- Chrome 4.0 supports Websockets.
- Firefox 4.0 beta supports WebSockets.
- Opera 11 (or 10.70) alpha also
- Safari 5.0.2 supports them too
- For other browsers it's not so clear.

Used source: [Stackoverflow][3]

---
###How do I test browser support?
You can simply use this Javascript to see if your browser supports HTML5 Websockets:

    function loadDemo() {
      if (window.WebSocket) {
        document.getElementById(""support"").innerHTML = ""HTML5 WebSocket is supported in your browser."";
      } else {
        document.getElementById(""support"").innerHTML = ""HTML5 WebSocket is not supported in your browser."";
      }
    }

It works great in desktop browser, android 2.3, IPhone 4S - any date formats. But, it  works in IPhone 5 (version 5.0.1 to be precise) *only if date format is yyyy-mm-dd.* 

Since, the format of date comes from excel sheet, we have no control over there so the picker have to work with variety of formats.

**Steps to reproduce the problem:**

 1. Setup a page and input type=""date"" to use mobiscroll. You can use
    mobiscroll demo page ([http://demo.mobiscroll.com/][2])
    
 2. Have any format different than yyyy-mm-dd, lets say mm/dd/yyyy so
    put the value of input type=""date"" as value=""09/27/2012"".
    
 3. Open the page in IOS 5.

**Expected:** 
When we click on the date picker, the picker should be loaded with given initial value and we should be able to set it to new value. Also, the format should be preserved even after the setting a new value.

**Actual:**
The input field comes as empty. The picker shows today's date, and when I click to ""Set"" in the picker, the value is not set into the input field.

We are using mobiscroll 2.0 rc3.

**Possible cause:**
I think this issue is some how related to the browser support for the html input type. We tested in Iphone 4S too, there we do not have any issue. What we have found is that Iphone 4S does not support for input type=""date"" (As checked with Modernizr) but the Iphone 5 has. 

We have not yet found the exact location for the fix but we at least feel that cause could be possibly this.

These questions worry me so the next option would be silverlight.. just beacause of my .Net background. I'm sure the .Net library got a lot of useful stuff already written like networking library etc.. 
I need some tips on this, basically what's the easiest way to start off an online realtime multiplayer game without using flash?",4

Genereally it works well, but now I found a very strange behaviour. The weird thing is that it is consistent on different browsers, so must be that I understood the thing wrong... despite this the docs seem to say exactly what I do. Here is the code (it's an object method):

        		'id' : this.viewId
        	});
        
        	
        
        	var canvas = jQuery(""<canvas/>"", {
        		'id' : this.viewId + ""canvas"",
        		'width' : this.width,
        		'height' : this.height
        	});
        
        	var w = this.width;
        	var h = this.height;

        };

after this I'll use jQuery again to append this element in a Div that is already in the page (that is blank). 
The result will be that the image is overstretched like ten times it's width.... That is weird because, for what I understood of drawImage, it should use the w and h values to scale the image and given that w and h are the size of the canvas, it should fit well.

What am I doing wrong? Is it because I do the drawing off the rendered dom tree?

I'm developing a **commercial** web software meant for sale and distribution. I need to take videos uploaded by users and compress, resize, and convert them for web playback. I intend to playback the videos using **HTML 5** video with Flash as a fall-back. Therefore, the output formats I'm most interested in are: **MP4, WebM or Ogg, and FLV**. I'd prefer to handle as many input formats as possible, but at the very least: .WMV, .AVI, and all the output formats. I'm developing with ASP **.NET**, so a C# interface would be preferred but command line works just as well. Money is not really an issue, can afford $1,000+ for per server license.

Video encoders I've considered:

 - **FFMPEG**: *Has all the features I need, but uses the GPL/LGPL license. Not suitable for commercial redistribution.* 
 - **MEncoder**: *(Same reasons as FFMPEG, the GPL license)* 
 - **Video Encoder Engine by Sothink**: *Just a wrapper for MEncoder and/or FFMPEG, still bound by GPL.*
 - **Theora/Xiph encoders**: *Acceptable BSD license, but this only gains me the .Ogg format. I also need at least the .FLV format, preferably .MP4 too.*
 - **WebM/VP8 encoders**: *Again, acceptable license, but this only gains me the .WebM format. I also need at least the .FLV format, preferably .MP4 too.*
 - **Encoding.com**: *Need to keep all the processing on our own servers. Client already owns the server power needed for video encoding, they don't want to pay to offload the work. Client's usage my fluctuate a lot so monthly plans may be wasteful, but at peek the volume is enough to make the pay-as-you go too expensive.*
 - **SUPER**: *I think it's GPL.*

These products do what I need, however I haven't found any information about server licenses and/or command-line/API interfacing:
 - DivX
 - Moyea/Leawo Video Converter
 - Squeeze


My best option may be to use multiple encoders: a Theora or WebM encoder and an .FLV encoder. In this case, **what would you recommend for a commercial-friendly .FLV encoder** and **which Theora or WebM encoder should I use?**

I've been able to replicate this strange behavior, but not predictably. Sometimes it won't happen no matter what I do, sometimes it happens with ctrl+scroll wheel, sometimes when zooming on the thumbs panel, sometimes zooming on the pdf itself.

I have been able to duplicate, eventually and unpredictably, in Firefox 13, IE 8, and Chrome. The site itself is MVC3 w/ Razor, HTML5, CSS3.",3

To me this issue of getting the application (bookmark) installed pretty much makes the rest of the HTML 5 features aimed at mobile HTML much less useful. I can't realistically expect users to prefer the bookmark install and launch process over regular apps, so I can realistically expect them to ignore my mobile HTML5 application and use a native app.

I essentially store the central part of my page (HTML) as my state object in the history. When a link is clicked I request just the central bit of the page from the server (identifying these requests with a different Accept header) and replace it with javascript. On popstate I grab the previous central part and push it back into the dom.

This mostly works fine, however I have found a particular issue which I am stuck on. It is a little complicated to explain, so my apologies if this isn't very clear.

There is a search form on most of our pages. The partial page loading via ajax is only on GET requests, and the form performs a POST which results in a full page load.

If I navigate the following set of pages, I end up on a malformed partial page consisting of **ONLY** the central content, without any of the surrounding dom:

Start on the Home Page (via full page load) - perform a Search (post-redirect-get)<br>
Takes you to Search Results (via full page load) - then click Home<br>
Returns you to the Home Page (via dynamic get) - click browser back<br>
Search Results (from popstate listener) - click browser back<br>
Malformed home page.

When the malformed home page appears, my popstate listener is not present at all.

What I *think* is happening, is that the second load (dynamic, partial) of the home page is being cached by the browser, and then when the full page back occurs, the browser is merely showing the cached partial response rather than the full page.

To try to remedy this I have added a Vary: Accept header to the response to let the browsers know that content may change based on the accept header. I have also added Cache-Control max-age=0, pragma no-cache, and a past expiry date to the partial loaded content to try to force the browser not to cache this, but none of this solves it.

Unfortunately my company does not allow external traffic to our dev servers, so I cannot show you the problem. I have looked at various similar questions on here, but none of them seem quite the same, nor do the solutions suggested seem to work.

If I add a pointless parameter (blah=blah) to my dynamic GET requests, this solves the problem. However this is an ugly hack that I'd rather not do. This seems like it should be solvable with headers, since I think it is a caching problem.

I am working on building a content editing interface using EmberJS and the HTML5 contenteditable attribute (via the [Hallo editor][1]). This means that valueBinding doesn't do the trick, since we're dealing with the actual page HTML, not input/textarea value attributes.  I've built a similar app in Backbone, which lacks dynamic bindings but allows you to set the model object as a property of the view.

What's the best way to get this working with EmberJS?  Should I set a property on the view to the entire model? Do I need to create some sort of innerHtml binding and view helper, modeled on valueBinding?

I've set up a fiddle with an example of what I'm trying to do (with basic jQuery handling of the contentEditable attribute, instead of hallo):
