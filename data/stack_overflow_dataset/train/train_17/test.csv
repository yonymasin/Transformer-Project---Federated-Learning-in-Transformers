Safari looks identical to Chrome but Opera and Firefox are showing the 'hidden' text of my drop-down menu. Opera is also not seeming to register paddings at all but my question is:

Q: What element is not being displayed in Firefox the same as it is in Chrome and Safari? 

The way I am hiding my menu is by setting the height equal to 0px and then on hover setting it to the proper 30px. I choose this manner as it can be transitioned to have the menu glide up and down.

I recently expanded to check the site on Opera, Firefox & Safari.

Safari looks identical to Chrome but Opera and Firefox are showing the 'hidden' text of my drop-down menu. Opera is also not seeming to register paddings at all but my question is:

Q: What element is not being displayed in Firefox the same as it is in Chrome and Safari? 

The way I am hiding my menu is by setting the height equal to 0px and then on hover setting it to the proper 30px. I choose this manner as it can be transitioned to have the menu glide up and down.

The client will handle the movement. Once the arrow keys are pressed, the client will do the movement, then sends the new coordination to the server which then will be broadcast to other users on the server to update the location of your character.

I've been hacking at this for a while...and have seen several similar postings, but I can't seem to figure this out:

The HTML5 input field validation CSS works in Firefox, Chrome...but alas, not in IE8...and much of my target audience will be using IE8.

...and yes: I'm using Modernizr, and I used Initializr to get the page template and CSS...I'm a bit confused why I can't get things working properly in IE8.

Here's a link to my test page:
[Test html5 page][1]


  [1]: http://www.msa.saccounty.net/utilitybilling/streetview/TestHTML5pagev6.aspx

The input field is red before proper entry, then validation simply turns green when input a valid account number, such as:
50011111111

The HTML5 code is as follows:

    <label for=""account"">Account Number: </label> 
    <input id=""account"" name=""inputAccount"" 
      placeholder=""input billing account number"" 
      pattern=""/(^500)|^\d{11}""

      autofocus

Any suggestions on what is probably a fairly simple thing to fix would be mucho appreciated!

* Should it be a NAV because searching is a method of navigation?
* Should it be a SECTION because it's a discreet section of the page?

An example of this can be found at the article [Loading spinner animation using CSS and WebKit][1], illustrated through this sub-page [(no title, but a working example of the prior link)][2].

I've no trouble in copying the code (from a different link than the one I gave here) and making it run in my own web page.  My difficulty is in making it the correct color.  For example, in the example I used the dial segments are all colored red.  I see no color setter, no ""color"", ""background"" or ""background-color"" in the CSS for the spinner or set explicitly in the DIV.  Or at least no setting of these that actually changes the color of the segment.
