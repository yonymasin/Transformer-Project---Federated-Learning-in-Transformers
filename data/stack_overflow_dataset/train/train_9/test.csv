>Given a 2D plane, suppose that there are around 6000 points on it. Find a line which passes the most number of points.

Many answers there say this question is hard and involving some kind of special algorithms.

But my view is different and maybe I am wrong.

**Here is my thinking:**

First I will give a axis system to the 2D plane. Hence, every point will have its unique x and y, i.e., `{x, y}`. For simplicity, we can put the axis system's `{0, 0}` as the left bottom of the whole plane and therefore every x and y are bigger than 0.

Then I have a theory:

If several points are on the same line, then it must be in one of the following 3 cases:

1. their **`x`** values are the same
2. their **`y`** values are the same
3. their **`x/y`** or **`y/x`** values are the same. But `x/y` case is the same as `y/x` case, so let's just focus on **`x/y`**.

Then I will have 3 hashtables. 

1. The first one (`hashtable-x`) is with key of `x`, the value is the list of points which have the same `x`; 

2. the second one (`hashtable-y`) is with the key of `y` and the value is the list of points which have the same `y`;
3. the last one (`hashtable-x-y`) is with the key of `x/y` and the value is the list of points which have the same `x/y`;

Then I scan the whole 6000 points, for each point, I will get its `x` from `hashtable-x`, and put the point into the value (a list) of that slot; then I will do similar things to `hashtable-y` and `hashtable-x-y`. 

Finally, i will scan all lists in the 3 hashtables and find the longest list will contains the points of the desired line.

How do you think of my algorithm?

>Given a 2D plane, suppose that there are around 6000 points on it. Find a line which passes the most number of points.

Many answers there say this question is hard and involving some kind of special algorithms.

But my view is different and maybe I am wrong.

**Here is my thinking:**

First I will give a axis system to the 2D plane. Hence, every point will have its unique x and y, i.e., `{x, y}`. For simplicity, we can put the axis system's `{0, 0}` as the left bottom of the whole plane and therefore every x and y are bigger than 0.

Then I have a theory:

If several points are on the same line, then it must be in one of the following 3 cases:

1. their **`x`** values are the same
2. their **`y`** values are the same
3. their **`x/y`** or **`y/x`** values are the same. But `x/y` case is the same as `y/x` case, so let's just focus on **`x/y`**.

Then I will have 3 hashtables. 

1. The first one (`hashtable-x`) is with key of `x`, the value is the list of points which have the same `x`; 

2. the second one (`hashtable-y`) is with the key of `y` and the value is the list of points which have the same `y`;
3. the last one (`hashtable-x-y`) is with the key of `x/y` and the value is the list of points which have the same `x/y`;

Then I scan the whole 6000 points, for each point, I will get its `x` from `hashtable-x`, and put the point into the value (a list) of that slot; then I will do similar things to `hashtable-y` and `hashtable-x-y`. 

Finally, i will scan all lists in the 3 hashtables and find the longest list will contains the points of the desired line.

How do you think of my algorithm?

**General question:**

What is an algorithm to seat people in a movie theater so that they sit directly beside their friends but not beside their enemies.

**Technical question:**

Given an N by M grid, fill the grid with N * M - 1 items. Each item has an association Boolean value for each of the other N * M - 2 items. In each row of N, items directly beside other items should have a positive association value for the other. Columns however do not matter, i.e. an item can be ""enemies"" with the item in front of it. **Note:** If item A has a positive association value for B, then that means B also has a positive association value for A. It works the same for negative association values. **Also**, you have access to all of the items and their association values before you start placing them in the grid.

**Comments:**

I have been researching this problem and thinking about it since yesterday, from what I have found it reminds me of the [bin packing problem][1] with some added requirements. In some free time I attempted to implement it, but large groups of ""enemies"" were sitting next to each other. I am sure that most situations will have to have atleast one pair of enemies sitting next to each other, but my solution was far from optimal. It actually looked as if I had just randomized it. 

As far as my implementation went, I made N = 10, M = 10, the number of items = 99, and had an array of size 99 for EACH item that had a randomized Boolean value that referred to the friendship of the corresponding item number. This means that each item had a friendship value that corresponded with their self as well, I just ignored that value. 

I plan on trying to reimplement this again later and I will post the code. Can anyone figure out a ""good"" way to do this to minimize seating clashes between enemies?

Basically many years back I used to work at a mutual fund and we used different tools to select optimize portfolios as well as hedge existing ones.  We would take these results and make our own modifications then sell them to clients.  After my company downsized, I decided I wanted to give it a try(to create the software and include my customizations) but I have no clue how combinations are actually generated for the software.  

After 6 months of trying, I'm accepting that my approach is impossible.  I was trying to use combination algorithms like from Knuth's book, as well as doing bit combinations to try to find every possible portfolio(I limited it to 30 stocks) on the NYSE(5,000+ stocks). But as per everyone I have spoken to this will take me billions of billions of years to just get one days results.

So what am I missing? We would enter our risk tolerance and view of the market(stock market growth expectations, inflation expectations, fed funds expectations,etc..) and it would give us the ideal portfolio(in theory..). With thousands of possibilities and quadrillion possible combinations of weights of stocks, how are they able to calculate results so quickly(or even at all)? As the admin of the system, I know we downloaded a file everyday(less than 100 mb and loaded in a mssql database..so its not like we had every possibility, I would get a 5 gig file in a min of doing my combination algo) and the applications worked offline(so it must have been doing it locally on the desktop/laptop cpu not on a massive supercomputer somewhere and took a min or two to run..15 minutes was the longest for a global fund which includes every stock in the world). Its so confusing because their work required correlation of the entire fund to be good(I don't think they were just sending the top stocks they pre-calculated because everyone got different results). So I wanted a 30 stock fund that gave me 2% returns and had a negative correlation with the market, and was 60% hedged how could the software generate that information? note, I'm not asking about the math or the finance part, I'm asking how it was able to generate 30 stocks from the entire market that gave 2% returns when in order to do that it would need to know the returns of all 30 stock portfolio(That alone would make it run for billions of years, right? the other restrictions make it more complex).

So How is this being done programmatically? I'm starting to believe they are not using Knuth's combination algorithm to generate every possibility yet their results don't seem randomly selected and individually selecting the stocks seems to miss the correlation part.

**Input** `Hello 1 World 2 blah blah 3 4 5`

**Output** `Hello 5 World 4 blah blah 3 2 1`


My first question is how many ways is there to solve this problem?
I have solved this problem using 3 stacks, one which stores double, one which store strings, and one which is used to reverse the string order.

I need to save the pattern so the program know which order the doubles comes, thus I save the pattern to the string stack. Since the stack is limited to size 10, I will need to save the pattern in another way.

So this is how my string stack will look like after the push

2. World*

So when at the first read I need to make specific read in that Stack position and just extract Hello out of it. Asterisk * is left for later use when I tell the program next pop is an double.

My second question is that I wonder if there is some other more elegant solution to this problem. Since my solution will involve some string manipulation to solve this problem. And as for now I'm not actually using the pop function in the string case as it is supposed to be used. I made the solution in C++ btw.",algorithm,string,stack,double,,,open,0,261,7,"Stack question: pop out in a pattern At run time I want to input two types of datatype, double and string.
One of the condition is that String should pop in the order I input, and double will pop as the usual stack behaviour, FIFO. Another condition is that the stack is limited to max size 10

E.g. one runtime example

**Input** `Hello 1 World 2 blah blah 3 4 5`

**Output** `Hello 5 World 4 blah blah 3 2 1`


My first question is how many ways is there to solve this problem?
I have solved this problem using 3 stacks, one which stores double, one which store strings, and one which is used to reverse the string order.

I need to save the pattern so the program know which order the doubles comes, thus I save the pattern to the string stack. Since the stack is limited to size 10, I will need to save the pattern in another way.

So this is how my string stack will look like after the push

1. Hello*
2. World*
3. blah
4. blah***

I have a form distribution problem. There is n forms in c categories (each form in 1 category). And there is u users, which each user can receive forms from at least one category (but maybe more than one category).

The goal is to distribute forms between users, so each user receive the same amount of forms. I prefer to equally use categories.

For example:

If categories are:

>C1 : 20 forms

>C2 : 3 forms

>C3 : 8 forms

>C4 : 2 forms

And users are:

>U1 with access to C1 and C2

>U2 with access to C2

>U3 with access to C3

>U4 with access to C1 and C3

>U5 with access to C2 and C4

The answer should be:

>U1: 1 x C1 + 1 x C2 | 2 x C1 (preferred)

>U2: 2 x C2

>U3: 2 x C3

>U4: 1 x C1 + 1 x C3 | 2 x C1 (preferred) | 2 x C3

>U5: 2 x C4

And _23 forms remains_.

Do you have any suggestion on how can I write such algorithm?

There could be a second question, which in that some Categories have a SHOULD CONTRIBUTE option. Which if set, all remaining forms in that category will distribute between users who have access to that. for example if C1 have this option enabled, the answer should be:

>U1: 1 x C1 + 1 x C2 _+ 9 C1_

>U2: 2 x C2

>U3: 2 x C3

>U4: 2 x C3 (to minimize remaining forms in C3 category) _+ 10 C1_

>U5: 2 x C4

and remaining forms would be _0 in C1_, _0 in C2_, _4 in C3_ and _0 in C4_.

I think its kinda [Bin Packing][2] algorithm, but I am not sure and I don't know how to solve it! :(

The problem is: a) it's O(n^2) worst-case b) I'm not convinced it would give me the smallest number for every case... Even the optimized bubblesort doesn't seem to be doing the trick.

This world is completely new to me, so I'd appreciate any feedback on what I have now before I continue. Any comment would be greatly appreciated:

**Learning Models**
In a machine learning based classiﬁcation, two sets of documents are required: a training and a test set. A training set is used by an automatic classiﬁer to learn the diﬀerentiating characteristics of documents, and a test set is used to validate the performance of the automatic classiﬁer. In supervised learning, documents in the test set are individually labeled, while in unsupervised learning they are not. Here, different methods of clustering and outlier detection are used to classify documents without outside interference. In the intermediate form, semi-supervised learning, training documents are not labeled by hand but through some novel way in which large quantities of documents can be batch-labeled.

**Algorithms**
An algorithm is an effective method expressed as a finite list of well-defined instructions for calculating a function. In NLP, algorithms can generally be divided into simple keyword counting, rule-based, and statistical methods. Of the latter, the most frequently used algorithms are lineair classifiers (such as Naïve Bayes (NB), Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt), and Support Vector Machines (SVM) or kernel machines), k-nearest neightbor, decision trees (amongst which random forests), and Markov models. In lineair classifiers, where NB assumes statistical independence of the features, MaxEnt and SVM do not.

Question

There are 128 placyers participating in a tennis tournament. Assume that the ""x beats y"" relationship is transitive, i.e., for all players A, B and C,  if A beats B and B beats C, then A beats C.

What is the least number of matches we need to organize to find the best player? How many matches do you need to find the best and the second best player??

---
Answer

First we consider the problem of finding the best player. Each game eliminates one player and there 128 players, so 127 matches are necessary and also sufficient. >>>> Understood....

To find the second best, we note that the only candidates are the players who are beaten by the player who is eventually determined to be the best - everyone else lost to someone who is not the best. >>>> Understanding (Those who are lost by the best players are the candidates of second best???? rite???)

To find the best player, the order in which we organize the matches is inconsequential - we just pick pairs from the set of candidates and who ever loses is removed from the pool of candidates. 

However if we proceed in an arbitrary order, we might start with the best player, who defeats 127 other players and then the players who lost need to play 126 matches amongst themselves to find the second best. >>>>>>>>>>.. confused

We can do much better by organizing the matches as a binary tree - we pair of players arbitrarily who play 64 matches. After these matches we are left with 64 candidates; we pair them off again arbitrarily and they play 32 matches. Proceeding in this fashion, we organize the 127 matches needed to find the best player and the winner who have played only 7 matches. Therefore we can find the second best player by organizing 6 matches between 7 players who lost to the best player, for a total of 134 matches. >>>>>>> confused......",algorithm,puzzle,,,,06/05/2011 23:51:35,not a real question,1,353,4,"Question on sorting.. confused!!

It is the red graph he's am going to use. It is inverted, so that when the post is first posted, it will have a time rating of 2.75 ($x=7$), after two hours, it will have a time rating of 0.89 ($x=5$). When the post has been posted for 6 hours ($x=1$), the post will disappear from the list in maximum one hour.

He thinks the function that makes up this graph is a bit too complicated. He wants something like: $y=x^3$. The only problem with this function, is that the flat part of it (where the y doesn't increase much) is too short, and the slope increases too quickly. The end ($0<x<1$) should be more abrupt than the beginning ($5<x<7$), because the post should be forced to disappear after 6 hours, and new posts should have enough time to be voted up before they loose too much of the time rating.

Right now, one can change $10 000$ in $g(x)$ into a higher number if I want the time a post is on the list to be longer. (Actually I wrote $10^y$ where y is a number defined in my script.)

So my question is: What is a better function to use to make this time rating graph? It would be preferable to have the beginning at 0 instead of 7. (He just don't know how to invert it.) It should also be easy to change the life time of a post, and preferably how abrupt the in and out slope should be.
