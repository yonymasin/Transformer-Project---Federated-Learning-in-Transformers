The streams can be be composed together using the following rules:  
You can put a stream starting at any point in time (its zero before it started). You can use the same stream few times (it can overlap itself and even be in the same position few times) and you are allowed to not use a certain stream at all.  
e.g.:  
input streams:

    1 2 3 4
    2 4 5 6 7
    1 5 6

Can be composed like:

      1 2 3 4
    1 5 6
            1 5 6

After the placements an output stream is composed by the rule that each output float equals to the square root of the sum of the cube of each term.  
e.g.:  
If the streams at a position are:

    1
    2
    3

The output is:

    sqrt(1*1 + 2*2 + 3*3) = sqrt(14) = 3.74...

So for the the example composition:

      1 2 3 4
    1 5 6
            1 5 6
The output is:

    1 5.09 6.32 3 4.12 5 6

What I have is the output stream and the input streams. I need to compute the composition that lead to that output. an exact composition doesn't have to exists - I need a composition as close as possible to the output (smallest accumulated difference).  
e.g.:  
Input:  
Stream to mimic:

    1 5.09 6.32 3 4.12 5 6

and a list:

    1 2 3 4
    2 4 5 6 7
    1 5 6

Expected output:

    Stream 0 starting at 1,
    Stream 2 starting at 0,
    Stream 2 starting at 4.

This seems like an NP problem, is there any fast way to solve this? it can be somewhat brute force (but not totally, its not theoretic problem) and it can give not the best answer as long as its close enough.

Longest path in cyclic graphs is known to be NP-complete. What optimizations or heuristics can make finding the longest path faster than DFSing the entire graph? Are there any probabilistic approaches?

I have a graph with specific qualities, but I'm looking for an answer to this in the general case. Linking to papers would be fantastic. Here is a partial answer:

 1. Confirm it is cyclic. Longest path in acyclic graphs is easily computed using dynamic programming.

 2. Find out if the graph is planar (which algorithm is best?). If it is, you might see if it is a block graph, ptolemaic graph, or cacti graph and apply the methods found in [this paper](http://www.springerlink.com/content/x4fbqn45f6u1jeyh/).

 3. Find out how many simple cycles there are using [Donald B Johnson's algorithm](http://dutta.csc.ncsu.edu/csc791_spring07/wrap/circuits_johnson.pdf) ([Java implementation](http://normalisiert.de/code/java/elementaryCycles.zip)). You can change any cyclic graph into an acyclic one by removing an edge in a simple cycle. You can then run the dynamic programming solution found on [the Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_path_problem). For completeness, you would have to do this N times for each cycle, where N is the length of the cycle. Thus, for an entire graph, the number of times you have to run the DP solution is equal to the product of the lengths of all cycles.

 4. If you have to DFS the entire graph, you can prune some paths by computing the ""reachability"" of each node in advance. This reachability, which is mainly applicable to directed graphs, is the number of nodes each node can reach without repetitions. It is the maximum the longest path from that node could possibly be. With this information, if your current path plus the reachability of the child node is less than the longest you've already found, there is no point in taking that branch as it is impossible that you would find a longer path.

""Never compute pi in binary - because it is goes on infinitely and is random, it theoretically contains every finite bit string. So, you will then possess all copyrighted material in existence and be liable for some serious fines.""

This is obviously meant to be humorous, but it got me thinking. If every finite bit string exists in a binary representation of pi, would it be possible to use this as a method of transmitting data?

For example, let's say I wanted to transmit a bit string that could be interpreted as an jpeg image. Instead of sending the information directly, I would find its location within the digits of pi, and simply send the location of the first bit within the digits of pi, as well as the lengths of the string.

This seems pretty straightforward to me, but the obvious hurtle here is that the probability of finding this string within even the first several trillion digits is remarkably small. So, it could end up taking an immense amount of time to find. 

My thinking is that several machines could be dedicated to searching for large files within pi, and then creating an index of all of their start locations. So, each computation would only need to occur once and then that information could be transmitted extremely quickly from then on.

So, what do you think? Is this at all feasible, or would these computations take far too much time?

I have all four volumes. These are based on old MIX version and not on NMIX(the newer one). I have no idea how assembly language works and I have some background in C/C++ programming.

The initial pattern constitutes the 'seed' of the system. The first generation is created by applying the above rules Simultaneously to every cell in the seed — births and deaths happen simultaneously, and the discrete moment at which this happens is sometimes called a tick. (In other words, each generation is a pure function of the one before.) The rules continue to be applied repeatedly to create further generations.
 
Problem.
The inputs below represent the cells in the universe as X or - . X is a alive cell. - is a dead cell or no cell. The below inputs provide the provide pattern or initial cells in the universe. The output is the state of the system in the next tick (one run of the application of all the rules), represented in the same format.

This got me interested, so I decided to play around with some code. Since I've never written anything like this before, I decided to write a simple (CPU-only) brute-forcer. My initial implementation dealt with a fixed length (4 digit) password. For testing purposes, I implemented it a la:

The accepted answer, which is quite good, was to run Dijkstra's algorithm twice - once to get from u to w and once to get from w to v.  This has time complexity equal to two calls to Dijkstra's algorithm, which is O(m + n log n).

Now consider a related question - you are given a sequence of nodes u<sub>1</sub>, u<sub>2</sub>, ..., u<sub>k</sub> and want to find the shortest path from u<sub>1</sub> to u<sub>k</sub> such that the path passes through u<sub>1</sub>, u<sub>2</sub>, ..., u<sub>k</sub> in order.  Clearly this could be done by running k-1 instances of Dijkstra's algorithm, one for each pair of adjacent vertices, then concatenating the shortest paths together.  This takes time O(km + k n log n).  Alternatively, you could use an all-pairs shortest paths algorithm like Johnson's algorithm to compute all shortest paths, then concatenate the appropriate shortest paths together in O(mn + n<sup>2</sup> log n) time, which is good for k much larger than n.

My question is whether there is an algorithm for solving this problem that is faster than the above approaches when k is small.  Does such an algorithm exist?  Or is iterated Dijkstra's as good as it gets?

I've read through a [question on speech recognition][1], which did partially answer some of my questions, but the answers were largely anecdotal rather than technical. It also still didn't really answer why we still can't just throw more hardware at the problem.

I've seen tools that perform automated noise reduction using neural nets and ambient FFT analysis with excellent results, so I can't see a reason why we're still struggling with noise except in difficult scenarios like ludicrously loud background noise or multiple speech sources.

Beyond this, isn't it just a case of using very large, complex, well-trained neural nets to do the processing, then throwing hardware at it to make it work fast enough?

I understand that strong accents are a problem and that we all have our colloquialisms, but these recognition engines still get basic things wrong when the person is speaking in a slow and clear American or British accent.

So, what's the deal? What *technical* problems are there that make it still so difficult for a computer to understand me?

Therefore, the levels should consist of several major ""domes"" linked together by narrow corridors, viewed from the side, navigated left to right.

While I have found some information for generating platformer levels in general, they tend to focus on ""smoother"" geometry- semi-random and somewhat chaotic hills, unaligned floating platforms and so on. Since I want my levels to resemble a building, I want long, coherently arranged platforms and preferably few ""floating"" platforms.

On the up side, tight control of difficulty is not an issue- my focus is not on physics/jumping so being navigable and not wholly illogical is enough for my levels.

I can think of some basic steps:

 1. Generate a random number of rectangles with randomized dimensions, and arrange them on a rough line. Perhaps do this by making a short random walk biased to the right to place each rectangles.
 2. Generate one building section inside each rectangle, complete with hallway doors.
 3. Connect the hallway doors.

Generating individual buildings is a bit more mysterious. I can imagine picking a random shape, such as square or dome or trapezoid with slanted roof or slanted side wall, then picking a handful of random points inside, and drawing a platform to the left or right until you hit a wall. Afterwards, a top-down scan can do some pathfinding and draw ladders to make sure every level is accessible.

Yes , it is , since searching an element requires `O(log(K))` , hence doing that 

for `K` elements would take  `O(K * log(K))` running time . 

But it looks too easy ,and I thing that somewhere along the way I forgot something ...

Any ideas would be much appreciated .

*It's Christmas! You have to buy presents!*

You have a set of already existing bundles of toys, and the corresponding price of the bundle:

    1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 => 58
    0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 => 27

    0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 => 73
    ...

Where a `1` indicates that the toy is in the bundle, and a `0` that it is not.

Now, Santa Claus promo is coming and a leftover bundle `X` is offered to you at a ""special promo price"". We will say `X` is a *bad* deal if there exists another bundle `Y` so that:

1. `X` is a subset of `Y`
2. `X` is more expensive than `Y`
3. `Y` contains at least `N` more presents than `X` (just to be sure)

The objective is to implement a function *`bool isBadSubset(X)`* which finds out efficiently whether `X` is good or not.

Given that there are millions of bundles, comparing it to each one is obviously not feasible. Moreover, you can take the assumption that in the existing collection of bundles, a subset of toys is always cheaper than a superset.

Tips:

- comparing whether a set is a subset or not of another set is easy
- one may limit the comparisons to set which are both *containing at least `N` more toys* and *cheaper*. However, the list might still be big.
- something in the direction of a sieve would be good

The challenge: is it possible to achieve this in constant time?

can anyone help me as to how to solve equation 2 to prove big omega. The hint which I got to know is to do perform integration. But I'm not able to do it. Kindly help me out here

Thank you very much.

I know the size of the struct, and the size and order of its elements, but not the data alignment for the struct or its elements.  I'd like to use a cleverer algorithm for determining how the struct was packed (that is, how each element is aligned) than brute-forcing my way through it.

To illustrate, I'd like to go from the size to the appropriate alignment, given something like this:

    typedef struct _foo
    {
                //       byte   2-byte     4-byte
        u8 v1;  // bytes [1],   [1-2],  or [1-2], including padding
        u16 v2; // bytes [2-3], [3-4],  or [3-4], including padding
        u32 v3; // bytes [4-7], [5-8],  or [5-8]
        u8 v1;  // bytes [8],   [9-10], or [9-12], including padding
    } foo;

As an aside, it seems alignment only matters up to the size of the data itself.  The 2-byte u16 is stored on a 2-byte boundary in 4-byte alignment mode.

So the size of a foo is 8 if it's just byte-aligned, 10 if it's 2-byte-aligned, and 12 if it's 4-byte-aligned.  I've got rules for going from alignment and composition to total size, but how do I go the other way and determine its alignment from its size and composition?

Currently I calculate the size of a struct for each possible alignment until I've hit on the correct one, more or less thusly:
    
    for(packing = 1,2,4,8)
    {
      total_size = 0;
      foreach( element in struct )
      {
        // add padding, if necessary
        while( total_size % min(packing, element.size) != 0 ) { ++total_size; } 
        total_size += element.size;
      }
      // pad total structure to appropriate size
      while( total_size % packing != 0 ) { ++total_size; }
      
      if(total_size == actual_struct_size)
      {
        actual_struct_packing = packing;
      }

Assume that we are dealing with a function that decreases, then increases, and that we want to find the minimum of value.  Ternary search works using the following recursion:

* If the size of the window is ""small enough,"" just return its midpoint.
* Otherwise:
   * Evaluate the function at the left and right boundaries; call the values l and r.
   * Evaluate the function at the 1/3 and 2/3 points; call the values m<sub>1</sub> and m<sub>2</sub>
   * If m<sub>1</sub> &lt; m<sub>2</sub>, then we are in the increasing region of the function and the minimum can't be between m<sub>2</sub> and r.
   * If m<sub>1</sub> &gt; m<sub>2</sub>, then we are in the decreasing region of the function can the minimum can't be between l and m<sub>1</sub>
   * Recursively search the 2/3 that weren't discarded.

This algorithm works quickly because it can keep tossing out 1/3 of the values on each iteration.

However, I feel like I'm missing something because I believe we can make this algorithm run much faster.  In particular, notice that we're always throwing out one of the thirds of the range between a boundary and one of the probe points.  This means that we retain the region between the probe point and the other boundary.  Because ternary search picks the probe points at the 1/3 points, this means that we retain 2/3 of the values at each point.  What if instead of probing at the 1/3 and 2/3 points, we probed at the 1/2 - &epsilon; and 1/2 + &epsilon; points for an extremely small &epsilon;?  This would mean that we would be tossing out 1/2 - &epsilon; of the range on each step, which means that the size of the range would decrease much faster than if we were just tossing 1/3 of the elements each time.

Is this modified version of the algorithm just ""better"" than the original version?  Or is there something I'm missing here that would mean that I shouldn't use the modified strategy for picking the probe points?

What I did so far?

    Greedy Approach: At every node N, try to finding out MaxBST.  
                          --
                         |  MaxBST(R->left),
            MaxBST(R) = <   MaxBST(R->right),
                         |  MaxBST(R->left) + MaxBST(R->right) + 1, if left and right BSTs can be combined.
                          -- 

    Conclusion: May not give optimal solution in each case. 
                Consider the root node i.e 10 in the above example, MaxBST(left) = 5
                (BST rooted at 50) and MaxBST(right) = 3 (BST rooted at 20), but as 
                we have seen, we can have LCNC BST of size 7 rooted at 10.
 
.

    Dynamic Programming: Do an inorder traversal of the given tree and store that in 
                         an array. Now apply the [Longest increasing subsequence][1] 
                         algo to get the size of the LCNC BST.

    Conclusion: May not give correct solution in each case as an increasing 
                subsequence may not corresponds to a valid BST. For example - 
                Consider the tree in the above example. its inorder traversal gives
             
                3 5 7 50 75 10 150 12 20 35
       
                One of the increasing subsequences is : 3 5 7 50 75 150 but it 
                doesn't correspond to a valid BST.
 
.

    Dynamic Programming: Another approach that is coming to my mind is that, for 
                         every node k, calculate the Max Size BST rooted at k. Once
                         we got this table, we can simply traverse it to find the

We need to return the row number and the column number for the match. The order of of the matching elements is the same. For example, If, i'th row matches with j'th column, and i'th row contains the elements - [1,4,5,6,3]. Then jth column would also contain the elements - [1,4,5,6,3]. Size is n x n.

Takes O(n^2). Is this correct? If correct, is there a faster algorithm?",algorithm,interview-questions,matrix,columns,rows,,open,0,376,4,"Matrix, algorithm interview question This was one of my interview questions. 

We have a matrix containing integers (no range provided). The matrix is randomly populated with integers. We need to devise an algorithm which finds those rows which match exactly with a column(s). We need to return the row number and the column number for the match. The order of of the matching elements is the same. For example, If, i'th row matches with j'th column, and i'th row contains the elements - [1,4,5,6,3]. Then jth column would also contain the elements - [1,4,5,6,3]. Size is n x n.
My solution:

    RCEQUAL(A,i1..12,j1..j2)// A is n*n matrix
    if(i2-i1==2 && j2-j1==2 && b[n*i1+1..n*i2] has [j1..j2])
       use brute force to check if the rows and columns are same.
    if (any rows and columns are same)
       store the row and column numbers in b[1..n^2].//b[1],b[n+2],b[2n+3].. store row no,
                                                     // b[2..n+1] stores columns that 
                                                     //match with row 1, b[n+3..2n+2]

While these standards specify how the model should behave, they don't give any details on how they should be implemented. 

The parts of the model I'm interested in are:

 1. Boxes have a width and height.
 1. Boxes can contain other boxes.
 2. Container boxes (parent boxes) are responsible for sizing and positioning the boxes they contain (child boxes).
 3. Boxes have orientation which may be horizontal or vertical. The orientation determines how the child boxes are positioned and resized.
 4. Child boxes may be flexible or inflexible. If the child box is inflexible it is drawn at the size specified in the width and height parameters. If it is flexible, then it is resized to fit into the available space in the parent container.
 5. Flexibility is relative to other child boxes in the same container, boxes with higher flexibility are resized more than boxes with lower flexibility.
 6. Child boxes can be constrained to a minimum or maximum size. If the child box is flexible, the parent box will never resize it below the minimum size, or above the maximum size.

Features 1-5 can be implemented quite efficiently. Feature 6 is problematic as the most efficient algorithm I can come up with is quite naive. The algorithm works as follows:
 
 1. Place all the boxes in a list.
 2. Loop through each child box and resize it using the flexibility to determine the amount to resize it by.
 3. If the size exceeds one of the limits, then set the box size to the limit and remove it from the list, and start from the beginning of the list.

Step 3 is where the efficiency drops. For example, if there are ten items in the list, and the last one has a constraint, then the algorithm calculates the size for the first nine items, then when it reaches the tenth one it needs to redo all of the calculations. I have considered keeping the list sorted and first sizing all the constrained boxes, however this comes with the cost of added complexity and the overhead of sorting the list.

I expect there is a recognised optimal solution considering this is a fairly common feature in browsers and frameworks (XUL, .Net, Flex, etc).

For example, if there are ten items in the list, and the last one has a constraint, then the algorithm calculates the size for the first nine items, then when it reaches the tenth one it needs to redo all of the calculations. I have considered keeping the list sorted and first sizing all the constrained boxes, however this comes with the cost of added complexity and the overhead of sorting the list.

I expect there is a recognised optimal solution considering this is a fairly common feature in browsers and frameworks (XUL, .Net, Flex, etc).

- Stop searching - because ""cost 5""  is less than a(3+3=6) -> we don't search for other solutions ? 
Solution is: 
**s-b-d, cost = 5**

Is it right  ?

Knapsack problem algorithm.

Nikolay Nedelchev Bulgaria, Sofia    e-mail : nickndn@gmail.com

Let’s have a set of objects O={oi},  i = 1,2…n each object having a weight and value.
Let’s have a set  of objects S = {si}, I = 1,2..m, each object being an unique subset of O.  
    Each object  of S has value which is the total value of  all the objects  oi  in the represented  subset of O,  and weight,  formed in the same way.
S contains:
1.	Every subset of O except those which have a smaller value than at least one of the other subsets with the same or smaller weights. (and except those which have same value with at least one of the other subsets with the smaller weights)
see Clarification
2.	Only one of the subsets with exact same weights and values,  no matter which.

Let  S be sorted by descending weights. 
The so formed set S, has the following properties:

Property A: The so defined set S contains all the possible best answers for all the possible knapsacks for which  there is a valid solution.

Property B: Each object in S is the best  answer for at least one possible knapsack.

Property C:  The list is sorted by weight.

Property D: The list is sorted by value (because of 1.).


Let’s have a new object  p of type O.
Let’s have a new set T  = {ti} of type S, which contains all the objects from S, but each subset is augmented with the object   p, so the value of each object  of T,  ti , is equal to the value of  si plus the value of p. The same applies to the weight.
T  has all the same properties  A( * ), B( * ), C, D.
Let’s add  p  to T,   as a singular subset  in the right position, in order to preserve the sort order by weight.
The so formed set T has lost properties B and D, but has kept properties A( * )  and C.

( * ) It follows from Prop A, that the set T contains the solutions to all the possible knapsacks  if t should be present in the solution.

As a reminder, S contains all the solutions if t should not be present.
So, we can create a new set S, which is formed from merging  the old S and T,  keeping with 1. and 2. 
The new set S has all the properties A.B.C and D for the new set O including   object   p.
The time complexity of the construction of the new set S takes O(N) time, with N being equal to the  size of the old set S.
If at the time of the execution  of the so presented algorithm, all the O objects and the capacity of the knapsack are known, all the sets S can be optimized according to the currently found best solution and input information, i.e. we can add to points 1. and 2.  a new point 3. That the weight of  the subsets  in S does not exceed the capacity of the knapsack and etc.
Because all the operations described here on S take a linear time, it follows that the overall time complexity of the algorithm is O(S1+S2+S3…SN)  (the sum of the sizes of all the sets S i.e. from definition of S : m1 + m2… mn) .


Clarification to 1.
If we have   o1(w = 2, v = 9)  and o2(w = 4, v = 8).
Then  S = {  s1 = (o1)   ,  s2 =  ( o1 + o2) }

We do not need the o2 object as a singular subset and will never need the o2 object in a subset that does not contain the o1 object

NOTES:
1. With a suitable representation in memory, every object in S can take constant space and the solution can be extracted in O(n) time,   n = size of solution. Also in general there is no need to keep all objects of all sets S.
2. If we compare this algorithm to the currently available dynamic programming algorithms we will note that the sum of all the sizes sets S which we have created, is smaller or equal to the size of the table, which we would have allocated (and calculated) during DP, in other words, the time and space complexities of the algorithm are always smaller or equal to the complexity of the DP algorithms
3. The algorithm can be used with all kinds of input data, including real, negative (as well as very big), etc,  numbers as weights.
4. We don’t need to calculate the last set of subsets S
5. The algorithm can be easily transformed to the algorithm of Horowitz and Sahni.

Please tell me about errors and other uncertainties.

The miles can be used, but if they are not used by a certain date, they will expire.  I want to make sure I expire the proper amount of miles but don't expire them if they have been used.  Therefore, I have to check if enough miles have been used in a given date range before they expire.  Here are my initial thoughts:

Have a miles table with the following columns:

 - user_id *- Foreign key to the users table*
 - number_miles *- The number of miles for this record*
 - miles_type *- Indicates if miles were added, used, or expired*
 - miles_expire *- Boolean value to indicate if these miles expire or not*
 - miles_date *- The date this record was added*
 - exipration_date *- The date these miles expire (if the `miles_expire` flag is true)*
 - processed *- Indicates if this record has been processed - only applicable when the `miles_type` is set to expire*

If I have a record every time miles are added, used, or expired from a particular user account, I figure I can calculate the expired miles as such:

 1. For each user, get the dates of the records where the `miles_expire` flag set to true, the `expiration_date` is before the current date, and the `processed` flag is set to false.  This will get the records for all miles that should be expired. 
 2. Get the first and last `expiration_date` from the previous query.
 3. Using the first and last `expiration_date` values from the previous step, get a list of all used miles within that date range.
 4. If the sum of the used miles from the previous step is less than the sum of the expiring points, expire the difference.  If the used miles are equal or greater, nothing has to be expired.
 5. Set the `processed` flag to true for all records within the first and last `expiration_date` range.  Either these miles have been expired or ignored as they have been used.

It appears this meets the following requirements:

 - Expiring miles are used first
 - It will only check the used miles for the same time frame as the used miles so using many miles in the past won't save future miles from expiring
 - Miles are only expired after the date and won't be if the user has used enough miles

Write an algorithm that receives a dictionary (Array of words). The array is sorted lexicographically, but the abc order can be anything. For example, it could be z, y, x, .., c, b, a. Or it could be completely messed up: d, g, w, y, ... It doesn't even need to include all the abc letters, and finally it doesn't have to be letters at all. It could be any symbols that form a string. For example it could be made up of 5, α, !, @, θ...
You get the idea. It's up to your algorithm to discover what the letters are (easy part).

The algorithm should return the correct lexicographic order of the symbols.

Note/Things to consider:
1. For a given dictionary, can you always discover the full order of all the letters? Consider a dictionary that only has 1 word, with more than 1 symbol...
2. You CANNOT assume that the dictionary is without error. The algorithm should determine if the dictionary contains contradictions and output that there is an error.
3. HINT: Think of a good data structure to represent the relations you discover between symbols. This should make the problem much easier.

I am working on new version of Risk Game. I want to change attacking algorithm to make it more similar to real life's war. Side which have more armies must have advantage over weaker side.


This is the original board game's rules below from wikipedia.
>Example of matching up attacking (red) and defending (white) dice; in this case the attacker has won the battle. When it's a player's turn to attack, he or she can only attack territories that are adjacent or connected by a sea-lane to his or her own territory. A battle's outcome is decided by rolling dice. The attacking player attacks with one, two, or three armies, rolling a corresponding one, two or three dice. At least one army must remain behind in the attacking territory not involved in the attack, as a territory may never be left unoccupied. Before the attacker rolls, the defender must choose to resist the attack with either one or two armies (using at most the number of armies currently occupying the defended territory[4]) by rolling one or two die. Each player's highest die are compared, as are their second-highest die (if both players roll more than one). In each comparison, the highest number wins. The defender wins in the event of a tie. With each dice comparison, the loser removes one army from his territory from the game board. Any extra dice are disregarded and do not affect the results.

I think this rules is not very good for real life's situations because we know from history that large number of armies have advantage over weaker side.

Currently I am using the following algorithm

    army1 = random.Next(1, 20 + (numberOfSolidersArmy1 / 5));
    army2 = random.Next(1, 20 + (numberOfSolidersArmy2 / 5));

2. Comparison for each index - **`1`** or is it **`N`**
3. Return true or false - **`1`**

###Finally

I forgot do we add these up or do we multiply them? I assumed we had to add so ended up with
 **`N+N+1`** so this must be a Big Oh! of N. `O(N)`

2. For a comparison it is not possible to determine when it will end. So what is time taken ( i assumed 1 because it may be found at first index, N otherwise as last index)

My App needs to display the objects that are 3 kilometers around the GPS position of the mobile device.
I have several thousands of objects and they are localized in large area (for example, several US state, several small country), meaning in my list of objects I can have one located in NYC and another one in Miami but I can have also objects that are very close (few meters).

Currently, my App performs an iterative search. For each objects I compute the distance with the GPS position and if distance is <= 3KM then I keep the object else I ignore it. This algorithm is not very efficient and I'm looking for an Algorithm that will give better performance.

I suppose there's a way to sort my objects using the geo coord and next to find more quickly the objects that are located around the GPS position.

My current idea is just to compute rectangle with the ""extreme points"", North / South / East / West (from 3km of the GPS position) to limit the search zone. Next I will compute the distance only for the objects inside this box.
I think something better could be done but I don't have the idea...

(1) What is the expected value of your money in n tries
(2) What is the probability of getting more than expected value in (1)

This is how I approached it. The probability of heads and tails is same (1/2).
Expected value after first toss = 1/2(2*x) + 1/2(1/2*x)  = 5x/4
So expected value is 5x/4 after first toss. Similarly repeating second toss expectation on 5x/4,
Expected value after second toss = 1/2(2*5x/4) + 1/2(1/2*5x/4)  = 25x/16

So you get a sequence of expected values:
5x/4, 25x/16, 125x/64, ...

After n tries, your expected value should be 5^n/4^n * x.

If n is large enough, your expected value should approach the mean of the distribution. So probability that value is greater than expected value should be 0.5.

I say 'economy' because this is used very loosely; it's pretty off from an economy you probably picture.

Currently, items have a few variables attached to them: price, floor, ceiling, velocity, spread, and stock.

Price and floor are the max and min prices the price can reach, velocity is the change in price per transaction, stock is self-explanatory, and spread is a variable I used for some calculation but is no longer useful.

My previous idea was to change the price by the amount of items purchased * velocity. So if I bought 10 cars for $10, and the velocity was $5, it would increase by (10 cars * $5) = $50, for a new price of $60. This was a simple way to demonstrate a higher ""demand"". Likewise selling a car would DECREASE the price by amount * velocity.

This is flawed in the sense that a player can buy 10 cars for $10 ($100 total), and then the price becomes $60 and they can sell them back immediately for $600.

Stock is an optional factor, so try not to utilize that.

My question is: how would you create this 'dynamic economy', and if you could, utilize the floor, ceiling, price, and velocity in your algorithm.

I say 'economy' because this is used very loosely; it's pretty off from an economy you probably picture.

    # f1 f2

 #, * and -> are symbols. a, b1, etc. are texts.


Since the moment I know only rpn method to evaluate expressions, and my current solution is as follows. If I allow only a single text token after each symbol I can easily convert expression first into RPN notation (b = b1 b2; d = d1 d2; f = f1 f2) and parse it from here:

a b c -> * d e -> * # f g * #

However, merging text tokens and whatever else comes seems to be problematic. My idea was to create marker tokens (M), so RPN looks like:

a M b2 b1 M c -> * M d2 d1 M e -> * # f2 f1 M g * #

which is also parseable and seems to solve the problem.

That said:
1. Does anyone have experience with something like that and can say it is or it is not a viable solution for the future?
2. Are there better methods for parsing expressions with undefined arity of arguments?
3. Can you point me at some good resources?

Alright, you've tuned in this far. The reason behind this query on math, is I'm curious in having large battles between units. Each unit could belong to a brigade that contains many units of the same type. however, the battle will progress slowly over time. At each phase of the battle, the state will be saved to the DB. Instead of saving each unit and each health for each unit, I want to save the number of units and the total damage on the brigade. When damage is added to a brigade, the f(N, H, D) is run and returns a % chance that a unit in the brigade is destroyed (all of its HP are used up). This then removes that unit from the brigade decrementing N by 1 and D by H.

Before you launch into too much criticism of the idea. Remember, if you have VAST VAST large armies, this sort of information cannot be efficiently stored in a small DB, and with the limitations of Web, I can't keep the data for all the units in memory at the same time.

I can do it if I were to have this example in front of me.. but trying to memorize it just like this seems like such a waste of time / error prone, when it's just one of the many that i have to study.

Is there any easier way I can be calculating this that's easy to memorize?  Tried googling but didn't come up with much... thanks

    M1 = [3 x 8]

    M3 = [2 x 5]
    M4 = [5 x 4]

        Pick a random integer j from k to n
        Swap A[k] and A[j]

After a single pass through this algorithm, the entries of `A` occur uniformly at random.

A common way to botch this algorithm is to do the following:

        Pick a random integer j from 1 to n
        Swap A[k] and A[j]

I recently read a delightful article by Diaconis, Fulman and Holmes entitled [Analysis of Casino Shelf Shuffling Machines][2] where the authors describe a physical machine that does the following batch shuffle:

    For k = 1 to n
        Pick a random integer j from 1 to 10
        Randomly choose to place card k on the top or bottom of stack j

The question the authors address is whether or not this gives a reasonably random ordering after a single pass. The answer is decidedly not. One way to see the flaw in this shuffle is to start with a deck of cards that has `n/2` red cards atop of `n/2` black cards. The resulting deck after a single pass will have at most 10 clumps of red cards! For `n = 52*6`, this isn't terribly random. The authors also show that an optimal ""guess the next card"" strategy for the once shuffled will, on average, correctly guess 9.5 cards, whereas an optimal strategy for a random deck will average only 4.5 cards correctly guessed.

Are there any other interesting single-pass shuffles that achieve near-randomness and/or interesting distributions? I'm especially interested in shuffles similar to the latter that work with batches of entries.

The authors also show that an optimal ""guess the next card"" strategy for the once shuffled will, on average, correctly guess 9.5 cards, whereas an optimal strategy for a random deck will average only 4.5 cards correctly guessed.

Are there any other interesting single-pass shuffles that achieve near-randomness and/or interesting distributions? I'm especially interested in shuffles similar to the latter that work with batches of entries.

Most algorithms that I run into in daily life usually seem straight forward and just involve problem breakdown/simplification...and can almost always be solved with brute force in the worst case scenario.  This problem is different though.

I think a possible way to solve this would be to have a tree of all the different components organized such that the highest priority items are at the top.  Traverse each node based on priority and at each node, check if we need to wait for parts for this component or if we can build the next lower priority item.  I could probably even move components up and down the priority tree based on what has been built.  Fiddling around with that idea, I think I could get something to work.  There could be many valid solutions to the problem but I only need to return one valid set.  

However, if I want to make the problem a bit more real world, I have additional features

> B.

I think this can be solved similarly to the first case with tools and human resources just being consumable parts.  But now it gets hard

This may not be entirely rigorous, but you guys get the idea.

If we have a set of items with any ordering, we can introduce two items not in the collection - call them alpha and omega - such that alpha < i and omega > i, by definition. Then any ordering (partial or total) can be defined by giving a series of rules of the form ""i < j < k"", where i, j and k are elements from the augmented collection.

Let's say that, instead, we have rules of the form ""j < i OR j > k"" where i < k. The ""sorting"" (perhaps ""arranging"") problem is now quite different. With regular sorting, we eliminate the possibility of their not being a valid sorted order by defining orders to be transitive. What restrictions can we put on rule sets of this form in order to guarantee solutions exist?

Ultimately, how might an algorithm for solving this problem look? Clearly, there is an algorithm for solving this problem: list all permutations of elements in the finite collection of elements, and check each one to see whether the constraints are satisfied. This is O(n!). A more subtle option is to translate the N-element rule set into 2^N rules sets, where each rule set uses only one of the possibilities (j < i OR j > k, but not both), then (for instance) verify the graph is acyclic and perform a topological sort.
