4) After all updates committed in branch-b2; I make sure I do an SVN Update on trunk and branch-b2.

I was using `ShellAndWait(""cmd.exe /c svn list --verbose http:\\localhost\trunk > text.txt"")`, parse that text file to get folders in trunk, then checked witch files are in those folders (with another ShellAndWait for each folder), if they were found get revision number and so on .. 

As you see in the end, in my code svn command was executed 13 times so file in repository was found. With svn list --verbose i also got revision number. For svn command to execute it lasts around 0.15-0.20 of a second, so my revision number gathering lasts around 2 seconds. Witch is not a problem. 

Getting tag is a problem, as i have folder in folder, so in the end we could have around 40 or even more svn executes, witch would make my tag function very slow.

Everything works like a dream, but now I am trying use the `svn:keywords` feature so I can include `$Id$` at the top of all my source files.  Now, for existing files I can edit the SVN properties and add this keyword and it all works fine, but I want this done automatically for new files - and I cannot make it work.

According to the documentation you need to edit a special Subversion Config file located in your `C:\Documents and Settings\<user>\Application Data\Subversion` folder.  My PC already had a copy of this file, so I changed it to look like this:

    [miscellany]
    enable-auto-props = yes
    
    [auto-props]
    *.cpp = svn:eol-style=native;svn:keywords=Author Date Id HeadURL Revision
    *.hpp = svn:eol-style=native;svn:keywords=Author Date Id HeadURL Revision
    *.rc = svn:eol-style=native;svn:keywords=Author Date Id HeadURL Revision
    *.rc2 = svn:eol-style=native;svn:keywords=Author Date Id HeadURL Revision
    *.cc = svn:eol-style=native;svn:keywords=Author Date Id HeadURL Revision
    *.c = svn:eol-style=native;svn:keywords=Author Date Id HeadURL Revision
    *.h = svn:eol-style=native;svn:keywords=Author Date Id HeadURL Revision
    *.wsf = svn:eol-style=native;svn:keywords=Author Date Id HeadURL Revision
    *.js = svn:eol-style=native;svn:keywords=Author Date Id HeadURL Revision
    *.htm = svn:eol-style=native;svn:keywords=Author Date Id HeadURL Revision
    *.html = svn:eol-style=native;svn:keywords=Author Date Id HeadURL Revision
    *.css = svn:eol-style=native;svn:keywords=Author Date Id HeadURL Revision

I then added a new file to an existing Visual Studio project (from within Visual Studio), added `$Id$` to the top and committed it - but, alas, the `svn:keywords` property is not being set.

Does anyone know how to get this working?  I even tried adding settings to the registry (in `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Tigris.org\Subversion\Config`) but still no joy.  I then tried messing with Config files on the SVN server itself, but nothing seems to work.

I have obviously missed something blindingly obvious!
",svn,windows,,,,,open,0,367,3,"Subversion auto-props woes This is driving me nuts so any advice from fellow users would be welcome.

I need to have Tomcat, Apache, and SVN running on this system, with Apache configured to pass JSP through to Tomcat, and SVN accessible through Apache.  I've tried all sorts of things, and googled extensively, but can't find the right combination that works.  I've been able to get svn://myname@localhost to work, but svn://myname@myserver.com won't work.  Nor will Apache pass through to Tomcat if I connect to the server at port 80.  All I get is the text of the JSP file.

I have a router in front of the server, with a fixed IP, and am using port forwarding to connect the outside world to the server.  If I forward port 80 to 8080 internally, then JSP pages load fine.  But passing 80 to 80 returns the above behavior.

Are there any how-to's that address this particular combination?  Is there anyone here who has experience with this?  Any help would be most appreciated.
