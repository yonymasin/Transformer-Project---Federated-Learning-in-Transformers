I have outsourced my project and i am looking for the best way to coordniate with my outsourced developers.  

In the current situation i have svn hosting where they upload the code revisions after adding features or any changes. 

I am currently looking for some hosting where they could upload the code for me to see the site in action and propose 

changes. 

 
Currently they run the code on their local server so i can't access it. 

So in order to test out the site, i export the code from the svn hosting(where they upload it) to a folder on my pc and then 

upload it to my hosting.... install database(from sql file they provide me in svn), make any   required changes to config 

file for username, password etc. and then run it. 

 Now this is a complicated and time consuming process as i repeat the same process everytime i need to see the website in 

action. 

I need something better.   I currently have a cpanel based shared hosting plan where i run different projects.  

I can't share this  account with my developers or anyone else since there is only one account(i suppose only 1 person can 

login at a time) and there are other projects as well which i don't want otheres to access.



I am looking for something that would allow me to view the website changes in action as they happen without me having to do 

all the dirty stuff(Exporting code from svn, uploading it to hosting, updating the db  and then run the project to see the 

site in action). 

Maybe my develoeprs can do this for me, but i am also looking to make their work easier so that they don't have to spend time 

on such things.



So,  what i have been thinking is  give my developers a separate hosting login which has both svn and web server so that they 

 easily move files from svn to web server for testing.  Also probably they can use Rync(excluding svn files) to just update 

the changes rather than the whole project.


My questions are:



1)Do you have a better suggestion or do you  know anything better then the current approach, any tools, services or process 

that allows better coordination/management for outsourced projects?



2) And probably can you suggest a hosting service that runs svn, web server and also allows or provides shell/terminal 

service to run rsync?

I'm working on a web-development project, where I have to perform a commit, in order to view the changes that are affected by my commit. In the meantime other people are comitting things as well. When I'm done with my subproject, I want to merge the change(s) (quite often 50+ commits) to another branch.

I can do:

`cd ~/project/branches/test`

`svn merge -c 500 ~/project/trunk` (single revision) or `svn merge -r500:600 ~/project/trunk` (consecutive range of revisions)

Unfortunately I'm working with a lot of small incremental code revisions (with unwanted revisions in between). So both of these methods won't work for me (or prove to be very ineffective).
That's why I always copy the edited files to my branch with `cp` or `svn cp`. This approach will overwrite everything if the file was already there. In some cases, this is not what I want (i.e., when some changes shouldn't be merged).

Perhaps, there is a way to merge stuff for a **specific file**, thus ignoring (partial) revisions that would effect other files?

When I'm done with my subproject, I want to merge the change(s) (quite often 50+ commits) to another branch.

I can do:

`cd ~/project/branches/test`

`svn merge -c 500 ~/project/trunk` (single revision) or `svn merge -r500:600 ~/project/trunk` (consecutive range of revisions)

Unfortunately I'm working with a lot of small incremental code revisions (with unwanted revisions in between). So both of these methods won't work for me (or prove to be very ineffective).
That's why I always copy the edited files to my branch with `cp` or `svn cp`. This approach will overwrite everything if the file was already there. In some cases, this is not what I want (i.e., when some changes shouldn't be merged).

Perhaps, there is a way to merge stuff for a **specific file**, thus ignoring (partial) revisions that would effect other files?

For their independent purposes, they work correctly.  

I can check in and out code fine, and I can create tickets in TRAC fine.

Inside of TRAC, I had Browse Source set up to point to the SVN repo,
and for months it worked fine.  Then, suddenly it no longer picked up new updates.

A couple things happened around the same time, and its not clear which if any of these things caused the problem:
- I created a new branch in the repo
- The SVN and TRAC insances are on the same server, but the domain names went from
being a single name, to being separate names.

Over the last 5-6 years these are some transitions I've gone thru:  

**SourceControl:**  
CVS => VSS => SVN    

**Project Management, Bug and Issue Tracking:**  
Paper => PostIt Notes => OneNote => BugNet => OnTime  

**Wiki and Documentation:**  
Word + Network Share => ScrewTurn Wiki    

**Builder Automation:**  
Cruise Control + MSBuild


Now, specially because of SVN and the Wiki situation, I'm looking into starting this team with something fresh. In the past we've had branching nightmares with SVN, and the more we try to fix it, the worst it becomes. The other challenge I have is to find something that is stable and integrated. You can imagine that BugNet+SVN+ScrewTurn+CruiseControl+MSBuild are quite different animals, so integration and synergy is very important; I don't want to be jumpint between 10 different applications to report a bug or assign tasks and review the work completed and look at the repo log.<br/>
So, the new team and I have been talking this out for a couple of days now, and I think we've narrowed it down to 2 posibilities:<br/><br/>
**1. TFS 2010**  
_Pros:_  
- All-in-One solution. It truly has it all, including a new SCRUM process template.  
- Very friendly user interface and SharePoint integration.  
- WYSIWYG Wiki and Office Integration.  
_Cons:_  
- High upfront costs in hardware and admin time. Software too, but it doesn't affect us because we have an MSDN subscription with free software.  
- I'm hesitant about the source control of TFS. SC is file-based and with central repository just like SVN and VSS. I really don't want to fall for the same issues we've had in the past. 
  
**2. FugBUgs + Kiln + CC**  
_Pros:_  
- Kiln uses Mercurial, with all the benefits of distributed source control.  
- Minimal upfront costs and planning time to get it up and running. $30.00 per user per month.  
- Very friendly web user interface.  
- WYSIWYG Wiki editor.  
- Very simple issue tracker and project management tools. It would be easy to integrate SCRUM processes.  
_Cons:_  
- Lacks builder automation tools for more integrated processes (like TFS). So this will mean we'll have to keep on banging our heads with command line functions and community tasks to maintain our builder workers.  


Back in the day, I used Visual Studio Team System 2005 and I didn't take the best memories with me about the system; but the new TFS 2010 seems a very solid bet. FogBugz and Mercurial are kinda like the new kids in the block and they bring fresh thinking to the new processes, but as always this is a double edge sword.  
Anybody with solid experience with any of these? Are we missing that 3rd option? Do you have that silver bullet for my problems?  

1. Tools Integration  
2. Minimize Source Control Branching and Merging conflicts (yes, it is necessary for us to branch out and merge)  
3. Friendly User Interface (not everybody is CMD hacker)  
4. WYSIWYG Wiki.  
5. Learning Curve for developers.  
6. Time to get it all running VS. Long Term Value.

Parts of it where converted from an old CVS repository some years ago (with cvs2svn or similar). Its current structure looks like this:

* trunk
   * latex
   * java
       * awt-doku
       * pps
          * build.xml
          * src
              * ant
              * de
                 * dclj
                    * faq
                    * paul
                       * (about 20 other packages)
                       * **ltxdoclet**
                          * (some java files)
   * lua
   * (other directories)
* branches
* tags
* import

A problem is that I did quite some reorganization on this repository - for example, all the contents of the *pps* directory was once in a subdirectory of *import* (I think I imported it there from CVS), and there may have been other movements, too.

I'm now interested in the contents of the *ltxdoclet* directory together with some other files along the path, like build.xml, the *ant* directory and so on. And I want to have their whole history, including any history before moving the files. And I want it as a git repository now (since I want to publish this on github). The tags and branches were never really used, so they are not important.

I do not want the rest of this repository (they'll get separate git repositories sometimes) - this would blow up my repository too much (and there is some stuff I don't want to publish).

Ideally, my resulting git repository (in the HEAD state) should look like this:

 * pps
    * build.xml
    * src
        * ant
        * de
             * dclj
                * paul
                   * ltxdoclet
                      * (some java files)

I don't really care about historical directory configurations, but the history should not contain any commits who did not touch any of the files in these directories (or their predecessors).

----------

Of course, [`git svn`][1] seems to be the tool of choice. (Are there others?) 

`git svn clone` seems to be the right command ... but with which options? I created an `authors.txt` to convert the CVS or SVN user names to my name and address. To have only the interesting files and directories, I use `--ignore-paths`.

This was my try:

    filter='^/xcb-src/|_00|src/resources|dclj/faq|dclj/paul/([^l]|l[^t])'
    git svn clone svn+ssh://mathe-svn/ --trunk trunk/java/pps -A authors.txt --ignore-paths=$filter latexdoclet

Of course, it shows only the history after commit 2306, when I moved `import/java-pps` to `trunk/java/pps` ... and it has lots of commits which have no changes at all.

To solve the first problem, I thought about giving also the old directory as `--trunk`:

    git svn clone svn+ssh://mathe-svn/ --trunk trunk/java/pps --trunk import/java-pps -A authors.txt --ignore-paths=$filter latexdoclet

This does not work, the first `--trunk` is ignored here, and it ends effectively on commit 2305 (before the move). (And it also contains lots of empty commits.)

My current try is to import the whole repository, filtering out anything not wanted:

    filter='/xcb-src/|_00|src/resources|dclj/faq|dclj/paul/([^l]|l[^t])|/esperanto|finanzen|diverses|homepage|konfig|lua|prog-aufgaben|CVSROOT|latex|tags/'
    git svn clone svn+ssh://mathe-svn/ -A authors.txt --ignore-paths=$filter latexdoclet-neu


The conversion is still running, but there certainly are lots of commits I don't want at all.

* Does anyone has better ideas on how to do this?
* Should I better import the whole repository first and then use [`git filter-branch`][2] to pick out the files and commits I want?

  [2]: http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-filter-branch.html",svn,git,,,,,open,0,799,9,"converting only parts of a subversion repository from git I have an old Subversion repository with lots of my private projects. Parts of it where converted from an old CVS repository some years ago (with cvs2svn or similar). Its current structure looks like this:

* trunk
   * latex
   * java
       * awt-doku
       * pps
          * build.xml
          * src
              * ant
              * de
                 * dclj
                    * faq
                    * paul
                       * (about 20 other packages)
                       * **ltxdoclet**
                          * (some java files)
   * lua
   * (other directories)
* branches
* tags
* import

A problem is that I did quite some reorganization on this repository - for example, all the contents of the *pps* directory was once in a subdirectory of *import* (I think I imported it there from CVS), and there may have been other movements, too.

I'm now interested in the contents of the *ltxdoclet* directory together with some other files along the path, like build.xml, the *ant* directory and so on. And I want to have their whole history, including any history before moving the files. And I want it as a git repository now (since I want to publish this on github). The tags and branches were never really used, so they are not important.

I do not want the rest of this repository (they'll get separate git repositories sometimes) - this would blow up my repository too much (and there is some stuff I don't want to publish).

Ideally, my resulting git repository (in the HEAD state) should look like this:

 * pps
    * build.xml
    * src
        * ant
        * de
             * dclj
                * paul
                   * ltxdoclet
                      * (some java files)

I don't really care about historical directory configurations, but the history should not contain any commits who did not touch any of the files in these directories (or their predecessors).

----------

Of course, [`git svn`][1] seems to be the tool of choice. (Are there others?) 

`git svn clone` seems to be the right command ... but with which options? I created an `authors.txt` to convert the CVS or SVN user names to my name and address. To have only the interesting files and directories, I use `--ignore-paths`.

This was my try:

    filter='^/xcb-src/|_00|src/resources|dclj/faq|dclj/paul/([^l]|l[^t])'
    git svn clone svn+ssh://mathe-svn/ --trunk trunk/java/pps -A authors.txt --ignore-paths=$filter latexdoclet

Of course, it shows only the history after commit 2306, when I moved `import/java-pps` to `trunk/java/pps` ... and it has lots of commits which have no changes at all.

To solve the first problem, I thought about giving also the old directory as `--trunk`:

    git svn clone svn+ssh://mathe-svn/ --trunk trunk/java/pps --trunk import/java-pps -A authors.txt --ignore-paths=$filter latexdoclet

This does not work, the first `--trunk` is ignored here, and it ends effectively on commit 2305 (before the move). (And it also contains lots of empty commits.)

",svn,mercurial,repository,,,,open,0,1919,12,"Converting SVN to Mercurial on Mac with working python binding doesn't work I try to convert a local SCN repository (with all its history) to Mercurial. I am working on a Mac (10.6.2). Therefore, I am using Macports as package management tool.

I started the conversion with:

hg convert file:// ´pwd´/calebsvn/ 

The result is, that it starts to work fine, but after a while, it stops. That is the output:

I searched you mailing list and I found the instruction to test the svn bindings in my local python installation. They work as you can see on the following output:


python -c 'import svn.core; print svn.core.SVN_VER_MAJOR, svn.core.SVN_VER_MINOR'

There have been multiple changes in all the projects, but I only want to merge **some** of the changes into the branch.

I've been using TortoiseMerge, merging my main form, compiling, and then merging associated projects based on compile errors, but it's going very slowly.

- changes that are dependent on changes to other projects, which cascade to yet more projects, etc.

Any suggestions on a better way to proceed?

I've a repository that looks like this

    /Project_A
      +- trunk
      +- branches
          +- Version_1
          +- Version_2
          +- 1st_Custom_version_for_customer_A
          +- 2nd_Custom_version_for_customer_A
    /Project_B
      +- trunk
      +- branches
          +- Version_1
          +- Version_2
          +- 1st_Custom_version_for_customer_A
          +- 2nd_Custom_version_for_customer_A

The branches are offsprings of their trunks counterparts. For example for Project_A

    Trunk ------------------------------------------------------>
    Version_1   \--------->                    \
    Version_2                  \--------->      \
    1st_Custom_version_for_customer_A            \--------------->

The custom versions have a life of their own now and don't get any updates from the trunk anymore (many differences).

I need to extract only the revisions that are relevant to the customer in a new repository. That is : /Project_A/trunk till the moment where the 1st_Custom_version_for_customer_A was created. Then /Project_A/branches/1st_Custom_version_for_customer_A and /Project_A/branches/2nd_Custom_version_for_customer_A. And then the same for Project B. All in the same repository.

I've tried svnsync but could only extract /Project_A/branches/2nd_Custom_version_for_customer_A, and even though the history is good, I still see all the commit messages for other branches (which is a problem in my case). 

As for svndumpfilter, if would be perfect if I had everything under ""/Customer_A"" from the beginning (I will work this way next time), but when the branch is a copy from another branch, then gets sometimes renamed, deleted, recrated, etc... I don't see it working properly.

Is there a way to code review a project that exists in TFS (Microsoft's Team Foundation Server) from a user's computer that is connected to that TFS repository via an SVN Bridge?

(related: an SVN Bridge is a tool that allows the use of Subversion tools to connect to an TFS repository)

Why?  Because we have developers that highly defend (to their death) the use of SVN over TFS.  And these senior developers will be doing the code reviews of checkins from the the 3rd party vendor.

The problem is that the project currently resides in TFS, and will remain there (per CTO's instructions).  We are allowed an SVN Bridge, but yet it is not clear to me if any of these code review tools support such a cross-platform.

How would it?  Well, I would think that it would know the files in the code review package.  Why can't it compare those files to an SVN directory instead of an TFS?

What prompted me to think of this environment is this demo of Code Collaborator:

http://smartbear.com/docs/viewlets/CodeCollabDemo/CodeCollabDemo.html

Screenshot:

![enter image description here][1]

Notice that at the begining, it asks for what repository to review?  What if the remote team chooses TFS, and the local team chooses SVN?  Yes, I'll ping their technical support for that question.  But I also wanted to post the question here for anyone that may have a similar setup.

Game - depends on Utility and GameEngine

We are using svn and CMake.

We have several programmers, each working on different components, and each time there is an update to, say, RenderSystem, the Game programmer doesn't want to recompile the whole thing.

We currently have svn set up like so:
  
> Util    
RS    
PS    
GE    
Game  
bin

The binaries need to be in the svn so that a programmer doesn't have to compile the ones they aren't working on. This means that, on the local side, the binaries have to be present in the source directory to link against, and those same binaries also have to be present in the build directory for the executables to run (dynamic linking).

When configuring CMake, each programmer chooses which projects they want to be built and which ones they want to just use the precompiled binaries for.

Whenever a project is built, the binaries are automatically copied to the bin folder (and thus committed to the svn). When a programmer updates and gets new binaries, they are copied to the build directory. 

We don't have a build server at the moment, so having the binaries automatically built isn't an option.

There are several annoyances with this method:

 - when committing, the commit window is cluttered with the .dlls and .libs
 - conversely, when updating the update window is cluttered with .dlls and .libs
 - if programmer A builds the whole thing and commits, programmer B will get a conflict with the dlls and lib files. This would only happen when when two programmers are working on a project in common, and since the binaries are generated from the code, it doesn't matter how the conflict will be resolved. This is an extra annoyance.
 - sometimes a programmer will have two builds generated from the source, and when one is rebuilt, the binaries have to be copied from the bin folder to the other. This means CMake needs to add a build event to copy any binaries that are different during each build.
 - each time a project is built, all binaries need to be copied from the source dir to the build dir (to update any that have been changed from from an external build) and then the binaries that were built need to be copied back from the build dir to the source dir. This makes for a lot of file copying and is error-prone.
 - there are different binaries for debug and release, and if programmer A is building in debug mode while working, then forgets to build the release before committing, the headers and binaries will not match.

The current system accomplishes two main things that we'd like to keep: there is one root source directory that needs to be checked out and updated, nobody wants to mess with having multiple things to check out; and the entire thing does not have to be built by each programmer, they can build just what they are working on.

I'd love any suggestions on how to make this smoother.

However, due to an error when using TeamCity, I've come to find that each repository also have their own sets of these files, but the contents there are almost completely empty. Do I need to replicate the relevant bits and pieces of the main configuration files down into each repository?

---

**Long story here**

The directory structure is like this:

    E:
     +-- Repositories
         +-- LVK
         +-- PrivateProjects
         +-- ExternalProjects
         +-- XYZ
         +-- etc.

Now, I in the Repositories directory, I have the following files (file contents are below):

    svnserve.conf
    authz
    passwd

svnserve.conf looks like this:

    [general]
    password-db=passwd
    authz-db=authz
    realm=VKarlsen Subversion Server
    anon-access=read
    auth-access=write

authz looks like this:

    [/]
    lassevk=rw
    *=r
    
    [LVK:/]
    lassevk=rw
    *=r
    
    [PresentationMode:/]
    lassevk=rw
    *=

and some other repositories etc.

and passwd looks like this (obviously not the right password though):

    [users]
    lassevk=MYSECRETPASSWORD

Now, what I'm wondering about is that TeamCity is complaining with an error message that says: ""Failed for the root 'svn://localhost/PrivateProjects/VS.NET/LVK_ReleaseScript' #2: svn: Not authorized to open root of edit operation"".

I found this page [here](http://www.digitalsanctum.com/2007/04/25/svn-not-authorized-to-open-root-of-edit-operation/), but it says to make sure you have the following in your svnserve.conf file:

    anon-access=none

I do, however, have `anon-access=read` in the file, but my question is really this: Each repository also have a conf sub-directory with the exact same files as above, just not the same contents. In fact, apart from setting the Realm value to the same thing as my main svnserve.conf file, the files are completely empty.

Is this correct? Do I need to replicate the relevant bits and pieces from the main svnserve.conf file down into the configuration files for each repository?

For instance, here's the contents of the three files under the LVK repository:

authz:

    [groups]

    [/]

passwd:

    [users]

""Like CVS, SVN makes use of .svn directories inside the source folders to store state of the local working copy, and to allow synchronization with the server. However, it can have the affect of polluting the local source tree, and can cause performance issues wiht very large projects or files.""

What does the bit about pollution mean? I've used SVN for C# & ASP.NET projects for a long time and haven't encountered any problems.  What probably does this quote think I should have been watching out for?",1

is there a way to configure the upstream differently so that the status will reflect the remote?
