In this formular I got a grid with dynamic number of lines (the user can add a few more line if he need it). In each line I got some TextBox and ListBox widgets. As I dont know how many TextBox and ListBox i will need i can't fix a setName for each one.

So i try to give a dynamic setName and here is what i have done:

      var columnTab = new Array (7);
      columnTab[0] = 'A';
      columnTab[1] = 'B';
      columnTab[2] = 'C';
      columnTab[3] = 'D';
      columnTab[4] = 'E';
      columnTab[5] = 'F';
      columnTab[6] = 'G';
      columnTab[7] = 'H';
        .....

      var projectList = app.createListBox().setWidth(150).setName(""projectList""+gridRow);
                  
            for (var i = 0; i < objects.length; i++){
              var row = objects[i];        
              (projectList+gridRow).addItem(row.project);
            }
            formgrid.setWidget(gridRow, 0, projectList);
      
      
           for(var i = 1 ; i<8 ; i++){   
              var gridText = app.createTextBox();
                      
              formgrid.setWidget(gridRow, i, gridText.setWidth(80).setName(""projectList""+columnTab[i]+gridRow));
            }
            gridRow++;
      
      ......

Then by clicking to the submit Button i start a new function where i need to get the value of each TextBox and ListBox. By using a Hidden I can get the values of the grid row that where i found a ListBox and TextBoxes.

But i cant get the value of the widgets and always get ""undefined""

Here is my code  :

    var buffer = e.parameter.projectList8
    var buffer2 = e.parameter.projectListC8


So maybe I'm doing it all wrong.
How i can get my values in the new function ?

As a new user i can't post screenshot so i will make a small schema of my application so my problem can be understandable.

",google,dynamic,textbox,grid,widget,06/11/2012 15:41:42,too localized,1,627,10,"How to get value of dynamix widget with Google Apps I'm working on a Google Apps project which contains a formular. In this formular I got a grid with dynamic number of lines (the user can add a few more line if he need it). In each line I got some TextBox and ListBox widgets. As I dont know how many TextBox and ListBox i will need i can't fix a setName for each one.

So i try to give a dynamic setName and here is what i have done:

      var columnTab = new Array (7);
      columnTab[0] = 'A';
      columnTab[1] = 'B';
      columnTab[2] = 'C';
      columnTab[3] = 'D';
      columnTab[4] = 'E';
      columnTab[5] = 'F';
      columnTab[6] = 'G';
      columnTab[7] = 'H';
        .....

      var projectList = app.createListBox().setWidth(150).setName(""projectList""+gridRow);
                  
            for (var i = 0; i < objects.length; i++){
              var row = objects[i];        
              (projectList+gridRow).addItem(row.project);
            }
            formgrid.setWidget(gridRow, 0, projectList);
      
      
           for(var i = 1 ; i<8 ; i++){   
              var gridText = app.createTextBox();
                      
              formgrid.setWidget(gridRow, i, gridText.setWidth(80).setName(""projectList""+columnTab[i]+gridRow));
            }
            gridRow++;
      
      ......

Then by clicking to the submit Button i start a new function where i need to get the value of each TextBox and ListBox. By using a Hidden I can get the values of the grid row that where i found a ListBox and TextBoxes.

But i cant get the value of the widgets and always get ""undefined""

Here is my code  :

    var buffer = e.parameter.projectList8
    var buffer2 = e.parameter.projectListC8


So maybe I'm doing it all wrong.
How i can get my values in the new function ?

As a new user i can't post screenshot so i will make a small schema of my application so my problem can be understandable.

I operate a web site that is very well indexed by Google. We hit all our keyword targets pretty much and rank really well. We have Google sitelinks etc.

For the last couple of years I've been using sifr/cufon text replacement for our navigation bar links (so text is beautified to some font).

This hasn't impacted our sitelinks, infact they ""appeared"" shortly after I started using Cufon, but this is more down to the age of the site, frequency of content updates etc. I'm sure.

My concern is, we have a new design going live soon that does away with text navigation links (home, about us, news etc.) and replaces them with rollover images.

This isn't really optional due to the way to design has been put together - I simply have to use these image rollovers.

My primary concern is, if I do this, I risk losing my sitelinks because Google might have issues crawling the navigation links/buttons as they are images.

I've spent a lot of time reading up on SEO impact on switching to using images instead of text links for site navigation and there are a lot of conflicting articles/views on it.

1) ALT tags: Some of the articles I have read state that simply using an Alt tag on my rollover navigation images (e.g. the Home Page text link which is listed as a sitelink on our google listing, would become and image with an alt tag of ""Home Page"" thus hopefully preserving the Google sitelink as ""Home Page""?)

2) TITLE tags: Some articles state using a combination of Alt and Title tags (set up as point 1).

3) Text-indent: Some articles suggest using both of the above and ""hide"" a text link of the button underneath it...

In addition to this, some sites have thrown doubt on the best method to use to implement the rollovers.

1) IMG tag with css styling.
2) CSS Sprites: Some say to use them with Alt/title some say to use IMG tag only.

So my question is, what is the safest combination of the above to go for in order for me to preserve our sitelinks on Google and indeed allow other search engines to crawl the rollover images without issue?

I appreciate it is best to use text but as I say, I really need to use these graphics instead.

If someone could help me with this (preferably someone with direct experience with this, rather than assumptions and guesses) I'd really appreciate it.

Thanks,

1. Books

2. Teachers

Yes, thats it! just two resources. When searching for example code they either had to copy the code from a colleague or simply read several books until they found the code which they needed. It was a very long and tiring process. When programmers could not find the code which they needed, then they simply had to code themselves (logic). For example, how to make two computers communicate with each other i.e. if you were developing a chat program. This kind of project could take months IF the programmer could not afford the books or the teachers for that matter.

Now with the advent of google, I could search for ""Java chat program"" and the WHOLE code would come up, I could just add what I need and market the software. Would everybody agree with me that this is actually not programming? and that the programmer is not actually a true programmer because google gives them everything on a plate. Even when I get stuck on code, in fact ALL the time, I just google and the answer comes up. And further if it wasnt for google it would take me months to work out a specific piece of code. Does this really make me or anybody else a true programmer?  Ive started iphone development, I find that if I dont use google, and just use books its IMPOSSIBLE to make ANYTHING.
I appreciate that even if you have access to google, you still need to adapt/change code to what you need to do with it – and I can create ANYTHING by doing this. 
ALL comments are appreciated. You see , what I really want to hear from all you programmers out there is that “ Yes Qessar, we are very dependent on google, and we search for the most basic of things, and you shouldn’t feeling guilty about that because we don’t ! And also if it wasn’t for google, projects which take us 3 months to complete now take us 3 weeks to complete because code which we need is just thrown at us from forums and google”.

Would every body agree with me that apart from being a programmer it SEEMS that these days its more about having EXCELLENT skills on using the correct keywords in google for whatever you are look for (i.e. “convert string to integer C#” etc) and being able to afford good teachers or paper back books (well now you can buy ebooks online).

Though lots of alternatives exist, no one satisfies me (see below for the reasons). Many suggest Google to open source it, but Google didn't response by so far. So I'd like to turn to open source world to develop one. In a nutshell, Google Notebook attracts me in the following ways:

1. Every notes of a certain notebook present in the form of ""list"" intuitively. Notes can be *dragged to rearrange* and organized into *Sections*, meanwhile notes and sections can be *collapsed* and *expanded* easily. To the best of my knowledge, no other note taking software or web service functions like that.

2. Need to begin a new note? Just move the mouse cursor to any ""blank strip"" between two notes and click--a new note will emerge there, waiting for your edition, or you can change it into Section freely. *No need for the stupid ""New Note"" button or anything of the kind, and you can always make your new note in the exact place you want.* That's the best part that Google Notebook offers, and that I'd like to seek for in the world of existed open source projects. 

Well, these are the most valuable things I'd like to have in my new note taking software. Please tell me which open source projects I should learn for, whether web-based (e.g. PHP projects) or executable software (cross-platform is better) will be OK. Thanks very much.

Can anyone get this simple example working?

The chart supports multiple series but for some reason I can't scale it so that the values are displayed within scale.

Any help appreciated,
