The question at hand is, what should I use for an editor?

For me, there are really two options, Emacs and VIM. I don't want to use any kind of IDE. I already have quite a lot of experience with VIM, but mostly for system administration and never really for programming.

On the other hand, I always wanted to learn Emacs, but every time I give it a try, I fail for lack of motivation. Last time I wanted to use Emacs for Ruby I ended up switching to TextMate, because it was just so much easier and more productive (for me as a Emacs noob).

But now that I'm going to work with low level stuff for Arduino, I want to get dirty and really learn to use the editor I chose to it's fullest. I don't want any hand-holding-IDE-stuff anymore.

The thing is, I still can't decide. I googled around a lot about Emacs vs VIM, and it usually ends up either in *VIM is better for small stuff and Emacs for bigger stuff*, but other people say it's a matter of choice.

To be completely honest, I'm leaning towards VIM just because I'm already familiar with it. On the other hand, every time I see someone praise Emacs, I feel sad because I've never really given it a try.

**Are there any low level programming specific (C/C++ or Assembler) things that I should note when deciding between VIM and Emacs?**

To make the browsing easier, I've setup ctags and cscope in Vim to jump to definitions and find references.

However, I find that neither of them are intelligent enough to know which class a member variable/function belongs to. For example:

    class Square;
    ...

    Square a;
    ...
    a.rotate();

However, when there are 200 classes with the same member function, it can be tiresome to hunt down the correct tag.

    Square::rotate()

Attempting to find all calls to `rotate()` using cscope brings up calls to Triangle's and other classes' rotate functions.

Then my computer died.  Now, originally I had installed gvim myself, which at the time was a ""no-no"" and is now is really a bad idea (what with all the people introducing viruses to the network and whatnot).

We have a software review board to which I was sent when I wanted gvim ""legally"" installed.  I was told that the standard text editor is UltraEdit and they don't want to support more than one.  If I want to use gvim I need to talk management into making it the standard.

I'm kind of at a loss.  Obviously, I can tout the cost savings, but I was having a hard time explaining what my fuss was about.  If it were another programmer, I'd just force them to use it and they'd figure it out for themselves.  But management folk aren't much interested in not being able to figure out you need to ""i"" before you can type, er, insert.

I told my manager it was like having a rowboat instead of swimming everywhere.  And sometimes you're motorboating in that thing, but I'm looking for concise, compelling arguments which aren't based on bad analogies.  There are a number of similar-ish questions, but I fear they trend too technical. Any ideas? 

And after all your awesome advice wins the day for me, how do I ease former UltraEdit users into becoming gvimmers?

Then my computer died.  Now, originally I had installed gvim myself, which at the time was a ""no-no"" and is now is really a bad idea (what with all the people introducing viruses to the network and whatnot).

We have a software review board to which I was sent when I wanted gvim ""legally"" installed.  I was told that the standard text editor is UltraEdit and they don't want to support more than one.  If I want to use gvim I need to talk management into making it the standard.

I'm kind of at a loss.  Obviously, I can tout the cost savings, but I was having a hard time explaining what my fuss was about.  If it were another programmer, I'd just force them to use it and they'd figure it out for themselves.  But management folk aren't much interested in not being able to figure out you need to ""i"" before you can type, er, insert.

I told my manager it was like having a rowboat instead of swimming everywhere.  And sometimes you're motorboating in that thing, but I'm looking for concise, compelling arguments which aren't based on bad analogies.  There are a number of similar-ish questions, but I fear they trend too technical. Any ideas? 

And after all your awesome advice wins the day for me, how do I ease former UltraEdit users into becoming gvimmers?

It will toggle comment from line 5 to 12. But instead I would like to be able to write:

I've used Vim for over 10 years; watching people use Emacs/Slime ... has made me decide to learn Emacs/Slime.

I want to get up to speed as fast as quickly:

* there are a bunch of ""finger macros"" I instinctively do -- I want to figure out the equivalent in Emacs/Slime & retrain myself

* Since I'm familiar with Clojure, writing elisp config won't be a problem (minus the dynamic vars sometimes)

What should I be reading / memorizing?

EDIT: note, I have tried VimClojure, and decided I like Slime/Swank more.",4

2974192,06/04/2010 12:42:30,128850,06/25/2009 13:54:43,353,15,How can I pare down Vim's buffer list to only include active buffers,"How can I pare down my buffer list to only include buffers that are currently open in a window/tab?

When I've been running Vim for a long time, the list of buffers revealed by the `:ls` command is too large to work with. Ideally, I would like to delete all of the buffers which are not currently visible in a tab or window by running a custom command such as `:Only`. Can anybody suggest how to achieve this?

It looks like the [`:bdelete`][bd] command can accept a list of buffer numbers, but I'm not sure how to translate the output from `:ls` to a format that can be consumed by the `:bdelete` command. Any help would be appreciated.
