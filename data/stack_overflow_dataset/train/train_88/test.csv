        endif

But probably that's not the proper way, doesn't work and I don't even know if it is possible.

Another thing I notice is that typing things like `:if (1) echo ""works""` doesn't work either, even though both `if` and `echo` are ""colon"" commands. It gives an error with `echo`. So do I need to separate each command in some way? Preceding `echo` with another colon didn't solve the problem.

Thanks for any help!",2
