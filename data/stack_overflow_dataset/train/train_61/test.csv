Let me try to explain what I'm trying to accomplish: I have a two dimensional array, and I would like to display its contents a certain way. I want ""rows"", and each row can display no more than three ""objects"", for lack of a better word. So I want to iterate over the array and create my HTML in the process. My idea is this: every ""first of three"" elements in the array should open up the ""row"". Every ""third of three"" elements should close the ""row"". However, if the last element in the [inner] array does not happen to be the ""third of three"", it should still close the row. So, for example, if we had something like `L=[ [0,1,2,3,4], [5,6,7] ]`, I would want to display it like so:

    0  1  2
    3  4
    
    5  6  7

Which might be marked up like:

    <div>0 1 2</div>
    <div>3 4</div>
    <div>5 6 7</div>

My first thought was to simply use the modulo operator and see if each iteration was the ""first"", ""second"", or ""third"" of a row, but Django templates don't directly support modulo (more on that later). 

So I came up with template code like this:

    {% for x in L %}
     {% for y in x %}
      {% cycle '<div>' '' '' %}
       {{ y }}
      {% cycle '' '' '</div>' %}
     {% endfor %}<br/>
    {% endfor %}

And this was a good start. Taking the above example, on `0` we would open a div, on `1` do nothing, on `2` close the div, on `3` open it, and on `4`... well, it wouldn't close, because `4` was not the ""third in a series of 3"". So, while Django templates don't have modulo, they do have a divisibleby check, so I came up with additional logic to say, if we hit the last element of the [inner] for loop, and it also is not divisible by 3 (so we don't have a duplicate close), then close the div:

    {% for x in z %}
     {% for y in x %}
      {% cycle '<div>' '' '' %}
       {{ y }}
      {% cycle '' '' '</div>' %}
    
      {% if forloop.last %}
      {% if forloop.counter|divisibleby:""3"" %}
        <!-- Row Already Closed -->
      {% else %}
        </div>
      {% endif %}
      {% endif %}
    
     {% endfor %}<br/>
    {% endfor %}


This worked better! Now, I got through the whole first inner array with proper markup. My issue is this: apparently, Django's cycle functionality does not reset when you go out of scope of the inner for loop. What this means is, my number `5` from the above example is not opening a div like it should, it is not being recognized as the first in a cycle. In fact, it's actually being recognized as a third, and so it is closing a div! 

So I'm not sure where to go from here. This appears to be a [known and unfixed issues in Django](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/5908). Can anyone assist, please? 


**tl;dr** I want to take a 2d array, e.g. `L=[ [0,1,2,3,4], [5,6,7] ]` and properly mark it up grouping no more than 3 at a time and without grouping any elements from multiple arrays together, like so:

    0  1  2
    3  4
    
    5  6  7

      {% cycle '' '' '</div>' %}
     {% endfor %}<br/>
    {% endfor %}

And this was a good start. Taking the above example, on `0` we would open a div, on `1` do nothing, on `2` close the div, on `3` open it, and on `4`... well, it wouldn't close, because `4` was not the ""third in a series of 3"". So, while Django templates don't have modulo, they do have a divisibleby check, so I came up with additional logic to say, if we hit the last element of the [inner] for loop, and it also is not divisible by 3 (so we don't have a duplicate close), then close the div:

    {% for x in z %}
     {% for y in x %}
      {% cycle '<div>' '' '' %}
       {{ y }}
      {% cycle '' '' '</div>' %}
    
      {% if forloop.last %}
      {% if forloop.counter|divisibleby:""3"" %}
        <!-- Row Already Closed -->
      {% else %}
        </div>
      {% endif %}
      {% endif %}
    
     {% endfor %}<br/>
    {% endfor %}


This worked better! Now, I got through the whole first inner array with proper markup. My issue is this: apparently, Django's cycle functionality does not reset when you go out of scope of the inner for loop. What this means is, my number `5` from the above example is not opening a div like it should, it is not being recognized as the first in a cycle. In fact, it's actually being recognized as a third, and so it is closing a div! 

So I'm not sure where to go from here. This appears to be a [known and unfixed issues in Django](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/5908). Can anyone assist, please? 


**tl;dr** I want to take a 2d array, e.g. `L=[ [0,1,2,3,4], [5,6,7] ]` and properly mark it up grouping no more than 3 at a time and without grouping any elements from multiple arrays together, like so:

    0  1  2
    3  4
    
    5  6  7

What would be the template code for that and why? ",2

The `unique_together` contraint works perfectly w/ the form when `parent != None`. However when `parent == None` (null) it allows duplicates to be created.

In order to try and avoid this, i tried using the form and defined clean_name to attempt to check for duplicates. This works when _creating_ new objects, but doesn't work when modifying existing objects.

Someone had mentioned i should use commit=False on the ModelForm's .save, but I couldn't figure out how to do/implement this. I also thought about using the ModelForm's has_changed to detect changes to a model and allow them, but has_changed returns true on newly created objects with the form as well. help!

Also, (somewhat a completely different question) can I access the make_slug() model method from the Form?

• Control to eventually customize few key components of the website (code about 5% of functionality from scratch)

I have a reasonable background in Python/Django and no experience with PHP, but I’m willing to learn PHP if I need to, since most of the tools (Drupal, Elgg, etc.) are written in PHP.

I’ve done a lot of Google searching, but haven’t found a definitive answer. It also seems that these platforms have evolved a lot over the last couple of years.

Does anyone have any recommendations or thoughts on these platforms based on my comments above?

Thanks very much in advance!

I have looked at many answers to related questions, but I have only found one solution that works, but appears crufty to me and not very DRY ([4378667][1]) /Disclaimer

I have a modelformset where I set extra to 0, because I only want to display a new form when the user presses ""add_method"". Everything works fine, except that the newly added forms are empty (expected behaviour: they contain the default value for name that I set in the Method table)

In models.py:

    class System(models.Model):
        method = models.ManyToManyField(Method)
        ...

    class Method(models.Model):
        name = models.CharField()
        ...

In view.py:

    syspar = System.objects.get(id=sys_id)
    MethodFormSet = modelformset_factory(Method, form=MethodForm, extra=0)
    if request.POST:
        if 'add_method' in request.POST:
            new_method = Method.objects.create(name='whatever')
            syspar.method.add(new_method)

            post = request.POST.copy()
            post['method-TOTAL_FORMS'] = repr(int(post['method-TOTAL_FORMS'])+ 1)

            post['method-2-name'] = 'whatever' # code needed here to get actual value of -2-

                    queryset=Method.objects.filter(id__in=syspar.method.all()))

I have a problem with the line: post['method-2-name']='' 
This is awful, because:

 - I have already set the value in the db table
 - I will need extra cruft to determine the value of '2' for each case

I tried [this approach][2], also tried setting initial (as suggested in answers to some other related questions), but neither worked and both also resulted in non-DRY code.

There must be a better way to do this...

    Product.objects.order_by('-price')

However, some products will have a sale_price, and I can't find a way to order these neatly so that the sale price interleaves with the normal price. If I try ordering by both fields:

    Product.objects.order_by('sale_price','price')

...then all the products that aren't on sale appear together, followed by all that are, instead of interleaving the prices.

Does this make sense? Does anyone have a way to solve this?

Doing it this way works, but feels very hacky, particularly as my '@user_is_staff' decorator has a more elegant redirect to a login page than the 403 error here.

What I don't know is how to apply the `@user_is_staff` decorator to the function only when it has been accessed with the `pupil` kwarg. There's a lot more code in the real view function, so I don't want to write a second one as that would be severely non-DRY.",3

The statement that is causing the problem is:

And the definition of Matter, which does contain file_num, and auditstatushistory and invoice as related attributes, is :
