There's a couple of reasons why the other user isn't sending video.

1. The other user got no camera
2. The other user got a camera, but the camera is currently being occupied by another application(Skype, Photo Booth, Google Talk, etc.)
3. The other user got a camera but hasn't allowed the use of his/hers camera.
4. *(Other unexpected problems I guess...)*

So how do I detect if the stream I receive from the other user is a black stream(because of the reasons above) using the NetStream class?

The closest thing I have came up with is by adding a timer that polls the currentFps() function from the stream I receive from the other user. But so far this seems pretty unreliable because I might get `currentFps() == 0` and show an error because of this even though I actually got video from the stream in some cases. The reason for this is because I poll the API every 4 seconds for the currentFPS function and let's say at 00:00:04 I get ""no video"" according to the poll but at 00:00:05 the video kicks in, and therefor I need to wait until the next *tick* until the error message disappears

This is what my current poll looks like

    function subscribingStatusPoll(e:TimerEvent):void {
      if (subscribingStream.currentFPS == 0){
        error.text = ""No video found from the other user...""
      } else {
        error.text = """";
      }
    }


This is the only *hack* I that I can come up with to detect this, but this is unreliable and I actually would prefer a way to instantly detect if the stream I receive got a working video attached to it without this *ugly poll*.

How can I go about doing it?

I have so far thought of two potential solutions:

1) Using a Flash sharedobject - but since they never expire, if the user closes the browser window without calling my quit function to remove it, the remaining object will interfere with other new sessions. (Perhaps a random number and timestamp to identify the instance?)

2) Using a localconnection - a bit hackish, this relys on the swf detecting whether a Localconnection object is being used, and not loading if that is the case. But localconnections seems to crash at the slightest provocation, so I am a bit wary of using it.

I've now managed to subclass a sprite, load a graphic from the library, and manipulate it around the stage. Next step is doing the same with a MovieClip, but it doesn't seem to be as simple.

Basically, I want a simple subclass of MovieClip, that uses a SWF that I created & exported in Flash CS5 (anything else that can create them?), and then added it into my library in FlashDevelop.

In my 'Main' class, I want something like this:

One of styles clients seem most keen on is text in a comic-book balloon. I would like to create this balloons programmatically (as opposed to embedding or linking to rendered graphics), because these balloons will have to change size at runtime, depending on how much text they have to hold.

Balloons are easy to draw for the most part: circles, rectangles or rounded-corner rectangles. The tough part, for me, is the tail (the little arrow-like part of the comic balloon that points towards the speaker). If you google comic balloon, you see that there are many varieties of tails.

The tail will always be on the bottom of the balloon, and it will sometimes point left and sometimes point right. I have been trying to come up with tail-drawing algorithms for a while, but I'm not happy with the results. I'm basically stumbling around in the dark, changing variables, looking at the results, and using trial and error to try to move closer to the magic numbers that will work. ""Work"" just means a result that looks pleasing, which I realize is subjective. Most of my clients will be a happy with anything that looks reasonably good and professional. 

I want this result to scale. And it would be great if it could work with as few inputs as possible, maybe just isFacingLeft, tailWidth and tailHeight (Which could maybe be a percentage of the whole balloon). Maybe an adjustable curveAmount.

If it matters, I'm using Flash/Actionscript, but any system that has some sort of turtle graphics engine should work pretty much the same way: I'm working with that standard flipped Cartesian grid (y increases downward), x and y coordinates, the ability to move a pen, draw lines and draw curves.

I might overlooked some tips and tricks to make this baby run even smoother. 

So hereby I open this thread to share whatever ninja tricks ever helped you in the past. A couple of mine which I can think of right now:

**Sequencing the animation:**

Let as less as possible transitions happen at the same time, try to make it act more as a transformer, one thing at a time. Next to gaining speed in animation, you probably end up gaining more flow.

**Keep the animating objects as small as possible:**

So flash has to calculate less pixels at the same time.

**cacheAsBitmap = true:**

Those big movieclips, vector shapes being moved around, are probably quicker moved when they are cached as a bitmap. Might take up some space in your memory, but anything for higher framerates ;)

**Destroy everything you do not use:**

Set those unused movieclips to null and then remove it as a child.

Does someone know off hand which file the Flash Uploader targets? I would love to conquer this problem once and for all!
",flash,magento,htpasswd,,,,open,0,160,8,"htpasswd, Magento, and the Image Uploader HTTP error When I password protect a Magento site with htaccess/ htpasswd, it causes the flash uploader to error. I'm aware of this problem with the request from Flash being rejected. I normally throw on a plugin that prevents the need for Flash (http://www.magentocommerce.com/magento-connect/Tobias+Renger/extension/1756/no-flash-uploader).

I also know there's a solution to let the file being accessed be excused from the password protection, which I use for Wordpress quite a lot, for the same problem. I'm not sure which php file the flash uploader accesses though, so I don't know which file to put in:

 
    <FilesMatch ""(the-file\.php)$"">
        Satisfy Any
        Order allow,deny
        Allow from all

Case 1 : I have a movieclip ""chicken"" on another movieclip ""plate"" 

Case 2 : I have a movieclip ""chicken"" on the stage (""stage"" is always the top/root movieclip container.


Often during enter_frame events, while I try to remove the ""chicken"" movieclip from its parent(plate or stage) . I get an error saying parent movieclip not found.
But what puzzles me is that the ""chicken"" cannot exist either visually/ in memory without being inside another 'container' .

How can this happen, can somebody explain how this ""chicken"" loses its parent reference to the stage or plate. The debugger stack shows the value of chicken.parent as null.

Would be really helpful even if it were a small comment.

At a high level - the app has a main screen, and several ""modal dialog""-type screens that pop-up to manage various user interactions.

(This is a similar pattern I use in most of the apps I develop...)

Typically - when the user clicks a UI control on the dialog screen (e.g., button, text box, slider bar, etc.) - the main screen needs to react, or manage the consequences.

It seems like there are two general ways to handle this:

1. Have the dialog screen dispatch events that the main screen listens for
2. Allow the dialog screen to call functions in the main screen when those controls are clicked (which requires that the dialog screen maintain a reference to the main screen, and that the functions in the main screen are public)

In general - I understand that one of the key benefits of the first method is that the dialog screen isn't so tightly coupled; it's only responsibility is to broadcast the event. This would allow me to more easily use the dialog class in other contexts, or applications.

But for many RIAs I develop - a particular screen is **SO SPECIFIC** to the the application that there's no chance I'd ever reuse it in another application. So, the ""easy re-use"" benefit is minimal.

So - if you eliminate that benefit - which method is actually better? (More performant, less resource-intensive?)

For example - if I use events, then Flash needs to manage many listeners for events that may never occur. So - it *might* be more efficient if the dialog window could call a function in the main screen directly, instead of dispatching an event.

Basically, I have a square in a sprite and four points that form a quadrilateral, and I want to apply a transformation to the sprite to make those points the vertices of the sprite.

There wouldn't be much problem solving this Math problem using 3x3 matrices, like in [this case][1]. The problem is that flash's native transform Matrix class doesn't perform non-affine transformations - which means, there is no way to access the u v w fields of the Matrix class.

With flash10's native support to 3D, it was introduced the Matrix3D class, which allows non-affine transformation, but is a mess to work with. Basically whatever you apply on this matrix isn't exactly what will appear on screen, since it will apply a mandatory projection matrix from PerspectiveProjection class. There is no way to disable this projection, and this perspectiveProjection matrix is always a non-inversible matrix(*1). The method described here - at stackoverflow, about flash10 orthographic projection -, of defining the fieldOfView property to near 0, or the focalLengh to a huge number, won't help to nullify the perspective projection for the edge cases that work with non-affine 2d transformations. This means that even though we can make a projection almost-orthographic when working with normal shear/scale/rotation of a Matrix3D, the same PerspectiveProjection on a Matrix3D with non-affine 2d transforms will still have a undesired perspective projection. Would there be any way to nullify this perspectiveProjection? Or maybe a better way to do it? For now I am using a workaround of separating the plane into two triangles, and applying two affine transforms on them.

Thank you very very much!

(*1) when the focal length equals to 1, the perspective projection matrix has the following form:

In this game there is a tank. This tank has a body and a turret. It can rotate 360 degrees and move foward and backwards and swivel it's turret 360 degrees. The tank base and the turret are seperate animated images.

I have set it up so that there is a tank movieclip and a turret movieclip. And I have added code to the tank movieclip so that it creates a turret for itself in the constructor part like this. 

     turret= new turretMovieClip();   
     addChild(turret)

So the tank movieclip class now has this turret variable that holds an instance of the turret movieclip. Also in the constructor of the tank movieclip, there is code to give itself a shadow. 

    var dropShadow:DropShadowFilter = new DropShadowFilter();
    dropShadow.distance = 5;
    dropShadow.angle = 45;
    dropShadow.color = 0x000000;
    etc....
    this.filters = new Array(dropShadow);

But this is the weird part. I expected the code above to only put a shadow around the tank because this is code for the tank movieclip. But it put a shadow around the tank and the turret. When I added the turret, the tank movieclip changed or something! I did not want this to happen. I want the tank to have it's own shadow and the turret to have it's own shadow.

Here is an image I made illustrating the problem:
http://i.stack.imgur.com/EJuf3.jpg

Fig #1 is from my old game. The shadow correctly casts itself over the tank and the ground. Fig #2 shows what the above code did. It gave a shadow for the tank and turret, but it only casts over the ground. Anyone know what I am doing wrong? I think I could fix this by making a master tank class that then creates a tank movieclip and then a turret movieclip. Is that how I'm supposed to do this?

The preloader says ""77% loaded..."", where the number 77 is a dynamic text instance called percentLoaded.  I'd like the textColor of percentLoaded to change on a gradient from #000000 to #FFFFFF, in gray-scale.

Therefore, I can't simply do:

    percentLoaded.textColor=(currentValue/100)*0xFFFFFF;

This just converts the textColor to a multiple of FFFFFF, but outputs a color since it's not three separate components.  Currently, here's what I've got:

    percentLoaded.text=currentValue.toString();
    percentLoaded.textColor=rgb2hex((currentValue/100)*255, (currentValue/100)*255, (currentValue/100)*255);

Where ""rgb2hex"" is a function defined within the class as such:

    public function rgb2hex(r:Number, g:Number, b:Number) {
		return '0x'+(r << 16 | g << 8 | b).toString(16).toUpperCase();
	}

It doesn't look like this is actually changing the color of the font though.  I've imported flash.text.TextField and flash.display.MovieClip, but am not sure if I'm missing something else.  Would this be easier to do with string concatenation?  Or is there maybe something going on with currentValue/100 and passing that as a Number?

I'm writing mp3 player in flash to use it on the website, everything works fine, but there is a problem with pausing the mp3 while the stream is still streaming. Normally it goes like this:

    pausePosition = soundChannel.position;
    soundChannel.stop();

and when play button is clicked
    
    soundChannel = sound.play(pausePosition);	
so it's really easy. But there is a *quirk*, as we can read on Adobe docs

> There is a quirk in the playback process for sounds that are streaming—that is, for sounds that are still loading while they are being played. When your application calls the SoundChannel.stop() method on a SoundChannel instance that is playing back a streaming sound, the sound playback stops for one frame, and then on the next frame, it restarts from the beginning of the sound. This occurs because the sound loading process is still underway. To stop both the loading and the playback of a streaming sound, call the Sound.close() method.

The thing is soundChannel.stop() only stops playback and sound.close() closes the stream so buffering/streaming is stopped. Using this method will cause that, when user clikcs play(after pause) the stream will need to be opened again and stream all data again.

I thought about using soundChannel.volume = 0; so user just can hear it, but it seams to work same as stop(), after 1st frame volume is same as before.

I know it's kind of complicated, but maybe someone dealt with similar problem in the past and know some solutions for it?
