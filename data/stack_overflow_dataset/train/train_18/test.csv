I have a lot of projects, some are in maintenance (they have been productive for years) and others in active development. This is an important fact because the problem happens on all projects on my computer and not on others.

The problem is that I run all web projects on tomcat and they all have database connections. I always used the ""Terminate"" button in favor of the ""Stop"" button to restart or stop tomcat from eclipse. 

For those who dont know, the terminate button is the red button that stops the app from the log console or the debug console, while the stop button is the same red button but on the servers console. 

It is a lot faster to stop the servers from the terminate button rather then the stop button, the problem is that ever since I upgraded to Helios my database connections no longer closed when terminating the servers... they do when stopping them normally.

Well no need to say that I discovered this because the database servers (Oracle, MySQL and SQLServer) started giving ""Too many connections"" errors.

The idea is a website which basically shows a table of items like mp3 files. The table also shows information like interpret, album, genre, length, etc. 

It should be possible to do the usual operations on that table like sorting, filtering, searching and also downloading the files.

Additionaly, users should be able to upload new files, fill in a formular with the additional information which would result in a new entry in the table.

Upload should maybe work by letting an administrator check the upload and confirm whether it should be allowed or not. Or is there any other way to allow uploading files, while keeping in mind security and preventing abuse.
Files could get big in size. 

The visualization can be quite simple, does not have to be something fancy like flash.

The idea is a website which basically shows a table of items like mp3 files. The table also shows information like interpret, album, genre, length, etc. 

It should be possible to do the usual operations on that table like sorting, filtering, searching and also downloading the files.

Additionaly, users should be able to upload new files, fill in a formular with the additional information which would result in a new entry in the table.

Upload should maybe work by letting an administrator check the upload and confirm whether it should be allowed or not. Or is there any other way to allow uploading files, while keeping in mind security and preventing abuse.
Files could get big in size.

Whenever a user requires inventory, user generates an inventory requisition, and if the inventory is available, the inventory will be directly issued and user’s inventory account will be updated. In case the inventory is not available, the purchase order will be generated for the required inventory to the corresponding vendor and sent to the vendor. Once the purchase order is received back, it will be updated as per the received inventory items. Finally the payment of the purchase order will be made. Hence the inventory will be updated accordingly. Once the inventory becomes available, based on inventory requisition, it will be issued to the end user, and the user’s inventory account will be updated.

On the basis of Inventory Management System, business process, and system design provided to you, you are required to develop “Inventory Management” and “Purchase Order Management” modules. You can use language of your choice for developing the given system.

**Inventory Management Module:**
Inventory Management Module handles the inventory requisition, inventory issuance, and inventory stocks maintenance.

**Purchase Order Management Module:**
Purchase Order Management Module handles the purchase order generation and purchase order receiving.

 2. **Architecture**
<br>Should we make proper classes for all entity and then work on it? and stored procedures. Or just working on controls value and pass run time SQL quires?

 1. there are more than 1 business-value-columns combination that become a unique PK
 2. the composite pk values get duplicated across the table details
 3. cannot change the business value inside that composite PK

I know hibernate can support both types of PK, but im left wondering by my previous chats with experienced colleagues where they said that composite PK is easier to deal with when doing complex SQL queries and stored procedure processes. 

They went on saying that when using surrogate keys will complicate things when doing joining and there are several condition when it's impossible to do some stuffs when using surrogate keys. Although im sorry i cant explain the detail here since i was not clear enough when they explain it. Maybe i'll put more details next time.

Im currently trying to do a project, and want to try out surrogate keys, since it's not getting duplicated across tables, and we can change the business-column values. And when the need for some business value combination uniqueness, i can use something like :

    @Table(name=""MY_TABLE"", uniqueConstraints={
        @UniqueConstraint(columnNames={""FIRST_NAME"", ""LAST_NAME""}) // name + lastName combination must be unique

But im still in doubt because of the previous discussion about the composite key.

Could you share your experiences in this matter ? Thank you !

I am quite excited about the new nosql approach, I love to have no fixed scheme and be prepared for horizontal scaling.

Now to our case: for complex mappings we already use a graph database. This fits best, we can connect everything with each other, I really push forward everybody to have a look to graph databases for big interconnectivity. But what about mass of plain data? This does not fit into graph databases. In our case it's gps data, plain latitudes, longitudes, timestamps etc. Currently we are using a rdbms for it, but I already get some poor performances in a database of about 4GB. The database is increasing 1GB per month, so I want to check what's the best database to be fit for the future. I could imagine to create a better scheme in the rdbms, for example to create a table for every user instead of one big table for all, but this would exceed to have 10 thousand tables today, and even more tommorow, I don't know if this would effect some other issues like maintaining the database, or at least administration.

So, I don't know if some 50-100 GB is seen as Big Data, but that's the size I am talking about in standard rdbms.

I already have some experiences with MongoDB. In short, I really love the way you work with MongoDB. But I am a developer, it's not all about how I work with the db, it's about user experience. MongoDB is creating even a lot more data. I guess it's about 5-10 times more than standard rdbms, depending on what your are indexing. Btw, a good pro for MongoDB is the index for geospatial data (lats, longs). But how is performance reacting on larger databases? I guess that instead of 10 GB my database in MongoDB, because of its BSON, will be at about 80 GB. Normally I would be glad with MongoDB, but in our case, as we are using already a graph database for complex data structures, I am not so sure if it is the best choice.

Maybe instead of a graph or a document based db, a key-value store would fit better. But I am no so experienced in these databases. What about Cassandra? It's Java-based, which would fit my needs, and it's easy to set up. But doing simple queries look quite strange, everybody is just talking about writes and direct reads. We need good performance in saying: give me all entries of user X between TS1 and TS2. That's all.

So in sum, We need the best db to 

- perform well in reads
- having an index over timestamps
- being structured by user
- only plain data (no relation between data)
- inserts are not time critically
- transactions are not needed
- should scale horizontally
