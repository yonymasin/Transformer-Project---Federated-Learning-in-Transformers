The result above of the EXPLAIN command shows that our query is sequentially scanning the ""buz_scdr"" Table (as highlighted above) which contains total 8094838 records. The query on the VIEW is not following the partition constraints (date) of ""buz_scdr"", which is causing it to scan the whole Table.

For experimental purpose, we directly executed a query on the ""buz_scdr"" TABLE with a WHERE statement along with date and time , and it duly respected the partition constraints and didn't scan the whole table. This indicates that the query executed directly on the partitioned Table is working as expected but the VIEW built upon it is having problems.

Is this a global problem with postgreSQL Views or have I missed something?

The result above of the EXPLAIN command shows that our query is sequentially scanning the ""buz_scdr"" Table (as highlighted above) which contains total 8094838 records. The query on the VIEW is not following the partition constraints (date) of ""buz_scdr"", which is causing it to scan the whole Table.

For experimental purpose, we directly executed a query on the ""buz_scdr"" TABLE with a WHERE statement along with date and time , and it duly respected the partition constraints and didn't scan the whole table. This indicates that the query executed directly on the partitioned Table is working as expected but the VIEW built upon it is having problems.

Is this a global problem with postgreSQL Views or have I missed something?

Is it a good rule of thumb for database IDs to be ""meaningless?""  Conversely, are there significant benefits from having IDs structured in a way where they can be recognized at a glance?  What are the pros and cons?

**Background**

I just had a debate with my coworkers about the consistency of the IDs in our database.  We have a data-driven application that leverages spring so that we rarely ever have to change code. That means, if there's a problem, a data change is usually the solution.

My argument was that by making IDs consistent and readable, we save ourselves significant time and headaches, long term.  Once the IDs are set, they don't have to change often and if done right, future changes won't be difficult.  My coworkers position was that IDs should never matter.  Encoding information into the ID violates DB design policies and keeping them orderly requires extra work that, ""we don't have time for.""  I can't find anything online to support either position.

My first question is about the complexity of one domain model.
I've got a model Account which represents an... account ;)
An account have a lot of relations with other objects. A lot of them need to be known by the Account object but some of them need to be known only for the other part.

For example, I've got a Message model which represents a message that is sent to an Account.
I don't really want to override my Account model with a new relation because it has already lot of relations, so I decide to make the relation between Account and Model unidirectional. 

So, I've mapped the relation with a ManyToOne relation only in the Message class and not in Account.

Do you think it is a good practice just to avoid too much relations in a model class (Account in my case) ? Or do you think I must map ALL relations to an Account in my Account class. So, what's the best practice, unidirectional or bidirectional relations ?

My second question comes from the unidirectional case. When I remove an account, due to unidirectional relation, all messages refering this account now failed to load because the parent Account is missing. 

What's the best practice to maintain a non corrupted database ? 
- delete all relations when the account is deleted (can be very dangerous in term of performance)
- make a job which delete progressively all relations and deactivate the account during this process

Or maybe you are going to bulk load it and order it on the disk with a clustered index.  Obviously, when you get to a quantity of data this size you have to stop assuming that you can do things like sorting in memory (well, not without going to virtual memory and taking a massive performance hit).

Can anyone give me some clues about how databases handle large quantities of data like this under the hood?  I'm guessing there are algorithms that use some form of smart disk caching to handle all the data but I don't know where to start.  References would be especially welcome.  Maybe an advanced databases textbook?",database,,,,,,open,0,138,12,"How do databases deal with data tables that cannot fit in memory?

9139480,02/04/2012 08:18:43,981487,10/06/2011 02:24:18,13,0,Hibernate error message: unexpected token: NULLS (error in script file line: 13 unexpected token: NULLS),"In learning Hibernate, I have encountered a very vague error message. First some quick back ground. I previously has a single table database that was working fine. Now I have added a second table and the first table features a collection of the second table. To put it more clearly, I previously had a Team table. Now I have added a Player table. The Team includes an attribute that will hold the team members of that team. Of course the team members are made of players. I want to get this working but I don't understand the error messages. I have included the files that I think are relevant. I have omitted my home controller and team controller and associated views as these were never touched from the previous working version. Also omitted are the DAO and Service layer; again not touched. Here is the error log:

Please let me know if you need more information. This doesn't make sense to me. Thanks.",database,hibernate,java-ee,,mapping,,open,0,3109,15,"Hibernate error message: unexpected token: NULLS (error in script file line: 13 unexpected token: NULLS) In learning Hibernate, I have encountered a very vague error message. First some quick back ground. I previously has a single table database that was working fine. Now I have added a second table and the first table features a collection of the second table. To put it more clearly, I previously had a Team table. Now I have added a Player table. The Team includes an attribute that will hold the team members of that team. Of course the team members are made of players. I want to get this working but I don't understand the error messages. I have included the files that I think are relevant. I have omitted my home controller and team controller and associated views as these were never touched from the previous working version. Also omitted are the DAO and Service layer; again not touched. Here is the error log:

It seems to imply that whatever you can do in RDBMS, you can do in Neo4j. Neo4j can be  a replacement for an RDBMS.


----------
I am interested in Neo4j for

 - ability to do quickly modify data ""schema""
 - ability to express entities naturally instead of relations and normalizations
 - ...which leads to highly expressive code (better than ORM)

This is a NoSQL solution I am interested in for it's features, not high performance.


----------
**Question:** What are the chief ""deficiencies"" present in Neo4j that may make it unsuitable as a RDBMS replacement?

I am particularly interested about:

 - is there any **DB feature** I must implement in **application logic**? (For example, you must implement joins at application layer for a few NoSQL DBs) 
 - Are the fields ""**indexed**"" to allow a lookup faster than O(n)?
 - How do I handle hot backups and replication?
 - any issues with ""altering"" schema or letting entities with different versions of the schema living together?


and the applications for which Neo4j is optimized for (""is optimized for highly connected data"")?

This strikes me as being slightly illogical. Having a seperate column for each browser seems a little funny - I don't know if this is me being skeptical or if that really is the easiest way to go about it. Can anyone suggest some other methods?

This database will manage every kind of products (TV, cars, computers, books, videogames, penciles, tables, pants...), but also, each product must have some properties (that will be indexed) for example, if the product is a book, the properties will be something like genre, year, author. If the product is a TV, the properties will be something like size, color, also year. And if the product is a car, the properties will be something like year, color, model, for example. So, this is my idea:

 1. One table to manage departments (like electronics, books...)
 2. One table to manage categories of the departments, this table will be a child of the previous. If the department is electronics, here will be audio, tv and video, games... (each category belongs to one department, the relationship is one department to many categories)

 4. One table to manage properties (like year, color, genre, model...)
 5. One table to engage products with properties, this table will be called ProductProperties

Im not sure if this is the best way, the database will be huge, I will develop the database on MySQL. But, I think this is not the best way, this article talks about ""Database Abstraction: Aggregation and Generalization"" [http://cs-exhibitions.uni-klu.ac.at/index.php?id=433][1], in other words generic objects (I think), but this way is old (70s).

If my company were working to build a service like this (again, not for airline seats but the mechanism is very similar) what would first steps be?

PS - two links that describe the essential functions relatively well:<br>
<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline_Reservation_System""> Airline Reservation System</a><br>
and<br>
<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_reservations_system"">Computer Reservations System</a>

Thanks so much in advance!",4

I liked some of the suggestions that were mentioned.  I have for the longest time wanted (needed) to revision many of my tables but never got around to it.  Being a programmer with only simple database work under my belt I was wondering how one would actually go about doing this.

I'm not asking for the actual solution in SQL syntax.  I can eventually figure that out for myself (or post SO when the time comes).  I'm just asking for people to comment as how they would go about doing it and any potential performance problems there might be if I was to 'revision' hundreds of million of records.  Or any other suggestions as long as it is based on the example bellow.

Given a simple example:

    Person
    ------------------------------------------------
    ID                UINT NOT NULL,
    PersonID          UINT NOT NULL,
    Name              VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
    DOB               DATE NOT NULL,
    Email             VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL

    Audit
    ------------------------------------------------
    ID                UINT NOT NULL,
    UserID            UINT NOT NULL,               -- Who
    TableName         VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,        -- What
    OldRecID          UINT NOT NULL,               -- Where
    NewRecID          UINT NOT NULL,
    AffectedOn        DATE NOT NULL,               -- When
    Comment           VARCHAR(500) NOT NULL        -- Why

I'm not sure how one would link the Audit table to any other tables (such as Person) if the TableName is a string?

Also, assuming that I have three GUI's to populate:

 1. A full record for a specific person id
 2. A table view listing all persons (by id)
 3. A view showing each person with their revision info bellow each entry (# of revisions per person, dates of revisions, revision comments, etc), ordered by the most recent revisions.

To accomplish 1 and 2, would it be better to query the Person table or the Audit table?

To accomplish 3, would a so called database expert simply get all records and pass it on to the software for processing, or group by PersonID and Affected date?  Is this usually handled in one query or many?

how do i put this result into a text box so that the i dont have to enter the no.of sales made in my sales commission form?????

thanks in advance

Currently I'm using this database with a custom PHP interface at localhost, but I'm looking for a different storage and a different interface as well.

I'm not very happy with the current setup, because the database schema is ""custom"" and I don't want to need to change it in the future (because maybe I will find a ""better way""). I think it's not standard and that this may bother me in the future.

My question is: **what is a good way to store data that is very flexible?** I'm looking for a standard data storage that I will to fill just one time. Is SQLite still the best choice? 

## What is inside this database:

I'm going to describe in general how's the structure.

* Table A is full of questions;
* Table B is full of answers. Each question has different answers;
* Tables from C are full of data regarding answer X of question Y. Each answer has a lot of different metadata available. 

## What is extremely important:

* fast queries;
* portability through *NIX without having to install a lot of software;
* not too complex queries, bit still I will need some joins;
* don't have to change the schema every two months.

## What is *not* important:

* frequent updates (I update the database once a year, more or less).

There are tools (e.g. RedGate) that help but it is still quite a lot of work to compare databases if autogenerated ID's are being used (as it is now in our DB, and yes, one way is to use natural keys to make comparison easier).

However, our metadata may be stored not necessarily in SQL database - it could be stored as documents in NOSQL databases (MongoDB, CouchDB, RavenDB) or even simple XML databases (maybe Berkeley DB XML?). Storing as XML file seems would work (as it easier to compare and merge files rather than databases) but may not be a good option as there needs to some concurrency mechanisms, some degree of transaction support.
We do not need replication to other servers, there is no need for high availability, etc.

Ok, I've already asked a question that lead me to discover the chapter 9 of the PHPUnit manual ( http://www.phpunit.de/manual/current/en/database.html ).

But the example are... not helpful. I can't figure out how basic thing works. I've also tried to read http://www.phpunit.de/manual/dbunit.txt, but reading statement like ""The implementation for this Array DataSet is simple and straightforward:"" followed by an incomprehensible and not so explained example make StackOverFlow my last hope.
[/intro]

I'm testing a Factory that simply retrieve all the ""post"" of a news system. I'll cut the example to something as simple as possible:

    $newsFactory->getAllNews();

The table looks like this:

    +---------+---------------------+-------------+
    | news_id | news_publishedDate  | news_active |
    +---------+---------------------+-------------+
    |       1 | 2010-03-22 13:20:22 |           1 |
    |       2 | 2010-03-23 13:20:22 |           1 |
    |      14 | 2010-03-23 13:20:22 |           0 |
    |      15 | 2010-03-23 13:20:22 |           1 |
    +---------+---------------------+-------------+

For now, I want to test those behaviour (but we'll focus only on the first one):

 - Make sure the query will return only news_active=1
 - Make sure the query will return the element ordered by news_publishedDate, from newest to older.

So I've made an dbData.xml dataset of what I consider as good testing data:

    <?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8"" ?>
    <dataset>
      <table name=""news"">
        <column>news_id</column>
        <column>news_publishedDate</column>
        <column>news_active</column>
        <row>
            <value>1</value>
            <value>2010-03-20 08:55:05</value>
            <value>1</value>
        </row>
        <row>
            <value>2</value>
            <value>2010-03-20 08:55:05</value>
            <value>0</value>
        </row>
        <row>
            <value>3</value>
            <value>2011-03-20 08:55:05</value>
            <value>1</value>
        </row>
      </table>
    </dataset>


Ok, so let's just check the first test (not returning the news_id #2 from the XML data set)

I must extend the PHPUnit_Extensions_Database_TestCase class to make my NewsFactoryTest class:

    <?php
    require_once 'PHPUnit/Extensions/Database/TestCase.php';
    
    class NewsFactoryTest extends PHPUnit_Extensions_Database_TestCase
    {
        protected $db;
    
    
        protected function getConnection()
        {
            $this->db = new PDO('mysql:host=localhost;dbname=testdb', 'root', '');
            return $this->createDefaultDBConnection($this->db, 'testdb');
        }
    
        protected function getDataSet()
        {
            return $this->createXMLDataSet(dir(__FILE__) . DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR . 'dbData.xml');
        }

        public function testGetNewsById()
        {
            $newsFactory = new NewsFactory($this->db);
            $news = $newsFactory->getNewsById();
            // ???
            $this->assertEquals(2, count($news), ""Should return only 2 results"");
        }
    }


My main question would be *how do I test that ?* or *What assertion should I do ?*

But I want to understand :

- Should I create a testdb database or is that all emulated/virtual ?
 - I've seen many examples using sqlite::memory: , is it a good idea to test MySQL based query with sqlite ? Can I use mysql::memory: instead ?
 - If it's a real DB, how do I restore all the data from dbData.xml in the DB before each test run ?
- Where am I supposed to call getConnection() and getDataSet() ?

For now I'll keep the question at that level. If (when) I'll need more specification, I'll open a part 2.

**The problem:** So, let's assume that the main application which needs to retrieve these data can get a fraction of the data as a whole from both repository A and repository B, - Furthermore, the data from B depend on data from A. A possible flow would be to the application first fetch data from repository A and then query repository B for the remaining data based on the data from the first query to A. 

I've currently solved the problem with retrieval of the data, so this is not my problem. However, the problem I need to solve is how I can ensure that data are kept consistent during the entire transaction of all the databases I need to retrieve data from. 

As an example, suppose I have two databases, each containing parts of a customers information. The first database may contain the name, address and phone for a customer, whereas the another database may contain the email of that specific customer. When querying for customer data as a whole I need both parts, but I want to be sure that during the retrieval of the data, the data I am going to retrieve must not change in the rows I get back from the databases.

So what I am looking for is either some good guidelines for how this may be achieved, and/or some practical knowledge on this problem.

Kind regards,

5) Generally, what 'stack' of technologies, including languages, servers, and databases would be used to create something like facebook (mind you, I have no desire to create a social networking site)

I can also use a **cache** for storing any kind of pre-calculated structure I want even if I end up choosing a relational solution, as long as updates can be handled in a reasonable way.

Several items should share similar access right settings (photos, status updates etc.), and these are the primary settings I want to handle right now:

* Private
* Public
* Available to my friends
* Available to friends of my friends
* Available my groups

The current implementation uses a relational database with flags for each item, and I can't think of ways to solve it without subqueries or multiple queries. I could, of course, use a many-to-many table combining items with groups or even users, but I fear that it would cause a huge amount of updates every time anything changes.

Right now, getting the actual content is a breeze, but I spend an insane amount of time on checking the permissions. Also, I can get a bunch of photos in a single request, but I need to check the viewing permissions individually since different rules may apply. This solution doesn't seem to scale at all.

I'd also like to handle exceptions for particular users or groups for a particular item. On top of this, there might be some cases that should be treated differently depending on the item class. For example, you might want to give users who are tagged in a photo the right to view that photo (for example in order to counteract [cyberbullying][1]).

* How do others solve this?
* Are there clever ways to make this work with a relational database?
* Can I do this in a DRY way, if many classes of items should be treated in similar ways?
* Are there other kinds of databases that I should look into, like graph databases or something? Any suggestions on specific software in that case?

I can also use a **cache** for storing any kind of pre-calculated structure I want even if I end up choosing a relational solution, as long as updates can be handled in a reasonable way.

This situation doesn't fit a specific language, but involves a database.

Imagine that you have a situation, in a management application, where the user (not a programmer so) can fill a table which rapresents the programming skill level of it's employees. Than he can assign those values to emplyees in emplyees table.

So the situation in the database is this one:

I'd like to fully grasp these concepts so my head doesn't hurt anymore. 

I'm used to dealing with an ORM like active record. When I imagine my user objects through rails I picture an object of a person being related to a row in the people table. Ok basic. 

So, I read that non-relational databases like mongodb aren't just cool because they're ""fast with big data"" but they're also cool because they apparently make developing more natural with an oop language (why?). Then I also read that most design patterns probably aren't truly relational. Ok, this is where I get lost. 

1) What are some fundamental examples of relational design and non-relational design?
2) similar to above, what are examples of structured data vs unstructured (is this just rephrasing above?)

So, given those things I feel (in my immediate ignorance) that almost every type of project I've attempted to model against has been relational. But maybe I'm just using semantics over technicality. For example, posts and comments. Relational to each other. Add users in there. it seems most apps these days have data that is always useful to reach through other data/objects. That's relational isn't it?

I create a routine to group workouts. A workout is a group of exercises. I record my reps and weight through log entries for my exercises. Is this relational data or non relational? Would mongo be great for modeling this or awful?

2. What should happen if I need to generate historical reports based on this data? That is, if I create an invoice / order history document with prices on it, then I later change the price for some items, clearly I want to reflect the actual cost of the items at purchase time. Should I copy the models of Cart* into Order*, and add attributes like `calculated_price`? Should I create new tables storing line items, with a FK back to each product?

I'm trying to get a feel for the way these are handled in other applications, and the pros and cons of each. Each solution I can see seems unnecessarily complex, but I'm not sure if that is a lack of insight by me or if this is simply a result of the complexity of the problem.

Yet with all the talk of refactoring code for maintainability I have not heard much of refactoring outdated database schemas.  

What are some tips on how to transition to a better schema without breaking all the code that relies on the old one?  I will propose a specific problem I am having to illustrate my point but feel free to give advice on other techniques that have proven helpful - those will likely come in handy as well.


----------


My example:

My company receives and ships products.  Now a product receipt and a product shipment have some very different data associated with them so the original database designers created a separate table for receipts and for shipments.  

In my one year working with this system I have come to the realization that the current schema doesn't make a lick of sense.  After all, both a receipt and a shipment are basically a transaction, they each involve changing the amount of a product, at heart only the +/- sign is different.  Indeed, we frequently need to find the total amount that the product has changed over a period of time, a problem for which this design is downright intractable.  

Obviously the appropriate design would be to have a single Transactions table with the Id being a foreign key to either a ReceiptInfo or a ShipmentInfo table.

I am looking to setup a system, and this is not about what to get, or what to buy, this is about what to use as a host as I want to virtual the different environments and need other developers input.

The type of development I will be doing will be DB development, prototyping, heavy app, and some ETL type of application. 

In these VM I will also setup small data marts to test the different processes that are created.

I was thinking of going with a linux host with 12 gig, 7i processor and also 1.5 gig (3 500 gig drives) raid 0 to help spread the disk io.  The reasons for Linux is that it is lightweight I could allocated more memory to the VM rather than having a host like Windows consume it.

Do you think this type of setup would be good to dev on? Would the VM be fast or slow?  How would read write be?


I would allocate 2 processors and 4-6 gigs of ram for the vm I am deving on.  I would be running 1 VM at a time.

Any opinions? advice?

As you can see I needed delete statement in my copydata function because otherwise I will get the unique constraint violated error. There are also no unique identifiers else I could have create the same function with an update query. 

I've thought about it , and I've come to the conclusion that I should do the following:
1) when executing the function  first create a copy( backup) from my current sat enviroment. ( we will use this later on) 

2) perform the same action used when copying all the data   i.e. delete data in the sat.

3) somehow merge the data from my development enviroment with the copy sat enviroment. 

example:
let's say 

    DEV data  has 4 columns   1   2   3   4 
                              x   x   x   x
                              x   x   x   x
                              x   x   x   x
    
    
    SAT data                  1  2  3  4     identical with different data  
                              0  0  0  0
                              0  0  0  0
                              0  0  0  0
    
    SAT COPY data             1  2  3  4 
                              0  0  0  0
                              0  0  0  0 
                              0  0  0  0
    
    new SAT DATA(merge)       1  2  3  4
                              0  x  0  x 
                              0  x  0  x
                              0  x  0  x

So ,as you can see only columns 2 and 4 contain the data from my dev enviroment and 1 and 3 still contain the data from my old sat enviroment.

This is what I want to achieve. 
Is this possible ? 
If so , any ideas how I can achieve this ?

As you can see I needed delete statement in my copydata function because otherwise I will get the unique constraint violated error. There are also no unique identifiers else I could have create the same function with an update query. 

I've thought about it , and I've come to the conclusion that I should do the following:
1) when executing the function  first create a copy( backup) from my current sat enviroment. ( we will use this later on) 

2) perform the same action used when copying all the data   i.e. delete data in the sat.

3) somehow merge the data from my development enviroment with the copy sat enviroment. 

example:
let's say 

    DEV data  has 4 columns   1   2   3   4 
                              x   x   x   x
                              x   x   x   x
                              x   x   x   x
    
    
    SAT data                  1  2  3  4     identical with different data  
                              0  0  0  0
                              0  0  0  0
                              0  0  0  0
    
    SAT COPY data             1  2  3  4 
                              0  0  0  0
                              0  0  0  0 
                              0  0  0  0
    
    new SAT DATA(merge)       1  2  3  4
                              0  x  0  x 
                              0  x  0  x
                              0  x  0  x

So ,as you can see only columns 2 and 4 contain the data from my dev enviroment and 1 and 3 still contain the data from my old sat enviroment.

This is what I want to achieve. 
Is this possible ? 
If so , any ideas how I can achieve this ?

I have spent hours reading up here in Stack overflow and the one thing I gather is that there is no ""Silver Bullet"". The system will need to be fine tuned/developed specifically to my needs. 

So this is my current mindset and thoughts...

**Database**

I am pretty impressed with Mysql 7 and their clustering capabilities. I would create a Mysql cluster of a few machines. This cluster would then be replicated to another offsite machine with their async mater-slave replication. The mysql cluster would be fronted by a mysql load balancer. Is the NoSQL root better maybe?

**Load Balancing**

HAProxy looks great but I might settle for a hardware solution...

**Application**

After playing around with many different AS servers (Glassfish, JBoss and a few others), I have come to the conclusion that j2EE limits me in a few things which cause cause problems down the line (see [this previous question][1]). What I am looking for is a framework for java that enables me to modularize my code. Basically write ""JARS""/modules that can be distribute into a cluster of machines that load balance and have failover.

For example - Lets say I have Module A and Module B. I want to have the ability to deploy the two modules both on two machines OR module A on one machine and B on the other. As well as have module A load balance to B (if B is on one or more machines). Is this achieved by glassfish3 and EJB? I like the idea of scaling out and not up, I would rather have 50 machines in a cluster than X insanely spec'ed machines (kind of googles mindset, I think)
I was thinking of doing it from scratch but re-inventing the wheel is my second choice. 

**Cache**

I am looking at hazelcast for a memory cache as I am most impressed with that solution.

Any input,feedback, links, keywords or guidlines will be greatly appreciated :) I also don't mind non-free solutions.

**Note!!!** I know this is a sensitive question and one could take it as a rant at the commercial systems (Oracle, MS-SQL Server, etc.). I'm not trying to question the quality of such systems, I'm just trying to make the most financial viable decision.

**Second note!!!** I also admit that the answer to this questions can depend a lot on the type of data I'm trying to store. For the integrity of the discussion, let's assume that the volumes of data can get pretty high (meaning more than 1 physical machine to store everything), consistency is not a critical issue (it's not a bank), security can be a big issue (simply loosing the data would not be that bad, but loosing data to hackers or some form of attackers could be catastrophic).

**Third note!!!** To further aid in the integrity of the discussion, assume that when I'm mentioning commercial systems I'm mainly reffering to Microsoft SQL Server or Oracle and when I'm saying open-source I'm reffering to MySQL or Postgre, although the potential options are not limited to these particular systems.

The aspects I want to find more information about are:

**Actual costs (taking scalability into consideration)**

As far as I can tell, commercial systems have a per hardware-piece(for e.g. per processor) and/or per user price model. This means that in order to scale up (adding more hardware) one has to buy more licenses. Is it worth it? Are the commercial systems scaling up seamelessly such that such costs are well motivated? Are the open-source systems harder to scale up (e.g. do I have to pay extra database engineers just to help maintain more physical servers?)

**Speed**

Are the commercial software systems better in this area? Are the reads/ writes/ updates faster? If I were to use a DBMS inside a speed critical application, what would make a more cost-effective choice?

**Load-performance**

Do the commercial systems function better under heavy load? E.g. will I end up saving money by buying less hardware to sustain more load?

**Ease of use and deployment**

Do I have to pay my database administrators more if going for open-source? Are the administration and or deployment tools in commercial systems easier to use (e.g. Will it lead to using less or less skillfull/costly db-admins)?

**Support level**

Is the support available for commercial systems better? Is it more cost effective? E.g. is paying annual support to the companies producing the commercial software more cost effective than hiring a dedicated employee to tackle the not-so-good support of open source variants? Is the not-so-good support level good enough (quality of manuals, tutorials, blog posts, etc.)?

**Security**

Are commercial systems more secure? Are they harder to crack? Is open-sourceness a vulnerability (e.g. everybody can see the code, thus everybody can exploit potential security vulnerabilities easier)? Is receiving security updates more costly?

**Update costs**

Is updating and eventually migrating data to newer versions easier in commercial software? Must I pay for new versions? Must I pay a lot (e.g. do companies provide some sort of special upgrade prices to new versions)?

**Personnele**

Are the people that maintain and/or use commercial systems easier to find or cheaper to employ? Does maintaining open-source db-system require more people or people that cost more?

**Interaction with programming languages and frameworks**

Are the drivers for communicating with commercial systems cheap? Are they free? Are they easier to use? Do they limit my technology choice? (e.g. can I access the data using any kind of programming language or do I have to use a certain technology - I can think that using Microsoft SQL Server is easier to do through the .NET Framework which implies costs for the operating system Windows and for the IDE - Visual Studio... sure I could access SQL Server through Python for e.g. but then I have to get Python programmers that I think cost way more than the average .NET programmer).

I'm sure that there can be other aspects that I've forgotten to take into account. Remember, I'm trying to make the most cost effective choice possible, I don't really care about coolness, publicity, branding, perceived quality etc. so please try to keep the answers in a financial direction.

A lot of applications create temp tables and the like, but I was surprised when Team Foundation Server created 80+ databases on my test SQL Server. TFS didn't install correctly, and kindly left me to clear up after it. Since each database had a naming convention, rather than delete each database by hand, I remembered how to use cursors and have written what I view to be the most unwise piece of T-SQL ever:

This database requires a lot of disk space, of course, as soon as it has 1 million entries or more.

**What is the best method to ""compress"" that set of data, i.e. reduce the required amount of disk space while no information is lost?**

My first idea was to create an extra column which holds the number of characters that can be copied from the beginning of the basic form. Then you just have to save the part of the inflected form that differs, e.g.:

	BASIC_FORM ##### NUM_EQUAL ##### INFLECED_FORM

	paragraph ----- 9 ----- 
	paragraph ----- 9 ----- s
	...

This should save some amount of disk space as ""NUM_EQUAL"" can be saved as TINYINT in MySQL (for example) so it requires only 1 byte and in the string ""INFLECTED_FORM"" you usually save more than 1 character (i.e. more than 1 byte).

This database requires a lot of disk space, of course, as soon as it has 1 million entries or more.

**What is the best method to ""compress"" that set of data, i.e. reduce the required amount of disk space while no information is lost?**

My first idea was to create an extra column which holds the number of characters that can be copied from the beginning of the basic form. Then you just have to save the part of the inflected form that differs, e.g.:

	BASIC_FORM ##### NUM_EQUAL ##### INFLECED_FORM

	talk ----- 4 ----- 
	talk ----- 4 ----- ing
	talk ----- 4 ----- ed
	talk ----- 4 ----- s
	try ----- 3 ----- 
	try ----- 2 ----- ied
	paragraph ----- 9 ----- 
	paragraph ----- 9 ----- s
	...

This should save some amount of disk space as ""NUM_EQUAL"" can be saved as TINYINT in MySQL (for example) so it requires only 1 byte and in the string ""INFLECTED_FORM"" you usually save more than 1 character (i.e. more than 1 byte).

Do you have other suggestions to save disk space?",5

I'm thinking that someone has figured a clean and easy way using open source software for iteration development with the ability to restore to any point (or at least daily) in a clean easy to understand state of all those files. 
It would also be nice not to have huge amounts of data always having to be downloaded from host as this could cause provider to shut down service for ""abuse of bandwidth"" (yes that has happened to me) so if nothing has changed on host then no need to download again. I'm terrified of having to backup 100+ websites if just a few are sucking up time.
Subversion programs such as TortoiseSVN seem promising but how could that work? I could have it on my local machine but doubt I can install on host server but maybe I don't have to.

So to recap, if a client calls and says hey I busted my website and I need to restore just say the Joomla install and keep the rest as is, how can I prepare and then do those types of things.

I have another question but I think I'll start a new thread but if you want to advise please do. How best to organize the folders and files of what I'm doing (webdev) on the host and on my local? I say this now because of how things are going to be backed up and some installs will have files nicely in their folders but also in the root directory so things can get messy and then local machine is not the same as host and then ahhh chaos!

I'm curious to know how big sites spread the load between the different DB server in the case where users write as much as they read, ie. when the standard solution of having one master to accept write, and several slaves that only let users read data doesn't work because it simply turns the master server into the bottleneck.

I haven’t decided yet if I can do that alone or with a 3-4 team of colleagues. The website will be owned by me or with 3-4 other colleagues. I believe if I am going to use the best resources I can find, the website might get hundred thousands of customers in the near future. 

However, I am just an Application developer (3 years of Java experience) and I don’t know more about Architectural staffs. So, I am seeking an advice how to build this system from the scratch and make it available for customers before 2013.

I am also focused on the future challenges I might face. So, instead of building the system quickly which might fail in the future or might cost a lot of effort, time, and money to manage it, I would rather build it in a timely manner, carefully, and by using the entire available source I can afford. 

Below are a list of things which you might consider giving me your advice on.
•	Using FreeSources (starting from IDE, to plugins and so on)

•	How much effort, time and money should I budget.

•	How to build the Architecture so that the system will be more extensible and easy 
to manage in the future.

•	Which languages to use (am good @ OOP languages like Java, and a little bit of Grails) 

•	I also considered the app to be accessible via Mobile phones 

•	Making the system cloud based.

•	Which Databases (either Schema based or Schema less) and Servers to consider.

•	Security issues

•	Should I use Test Driven Development?

•	How about documentation?

•	What frameworks to use, instead of inventing the wheels from the scratch. Like for security purpose I might consider Shiro framework, and so on.

•	Use of patterns and algorithms.

•	In the future if the project went well and needs some more experts, I planned to make it open source.

•	How to use social networking features.

•	And any of your comments.

•	
I would prefer if you are a professional and have an experience with different technologies in the past few years. Even if you tell me your past experience, I will appreciate that.Thank you for your time.

i was thinking about using google, but realized that with the amount of requests i will send them, i will probably get throttled, and or IP banned, so that is not an option.

i have tried many things, but in the interest of keeping this question concise and perhaps getting better methods, i will not list them here.",5

I've a pretty good idea how the whole system should work but I'm having some trouble figuring out the ideal database design and I need some help with it.

The usual work flow should be something like this:

 1. Everyone is welcome to register as a member; each member should have a name, email address and password.
 2. **Each week a new betting contest is opened, each contest has a fixed set of ""questions""** (in this case each ""question"" is basically in the form of ""Home Team - Visiting Team"").
 3. Each member is free to **cast his prognostic in the form of ""1 X 2""** (1: Home Wins, X: Draw, 2: Visiting Wins; **for each ""question""**) on all the **open** contests available together with an amount of money (see point 5). **Only one prognostic per contest is allowed**.
 4. On the end of each week all the contests are closed and a **real bet is placed based on all the individual bets and the performance of each member** ([see also this related question][1]). The placed bet should be publicly available for everyone to see.
 5. When the result of all matches is known it should be possible to ""attach"" (sorry, I'm missing the word) the amount of money of the prize (if the community gets lucky, of course). **The prize should then be proportionally divided by the amount each team member placed on the bet**.
 6. Each member can at any given time deposit or withdraw a variable amount of money to / from his account, there should also be a **transactions page where all the deposits, prizes and withdraws are presented**.

Bonus Question: Since I'm still pretty much green at ""SEO friendly"" URLs I would also be interested in learning **how would you name all the segments involved in this system**.

I would very much appreciate any help in the design of a DB schema that can accommodate this whole scenario.

**PS: I'll open up a bounty for this question, I'm currently having some issues with my Internet connection so I might take some time to read / comment on your answers.**

Each row consists of only two things: a time and one or more values. Let's assume the time is not regularly distributed. That is to say, one row may be on Second 1, and the next row may be on Second 2, but the third row may be on Second 23. Let's also assume I want to collect a huge number of rows, anywhere from a hundred thousand to a hundred million.

Naturally, a great way to explore data like this is to plot it on a two-dimensional line graph, with time being the independent variable and each of the values in the rows being the dependent variable.

A naive approach to plotting the data is to pick a time range, and then simply retrieve all of the rows that occur within that range, then plot their values using some graphing software or library of some sort.

However, I can think of a number of scenarios where this is impractical. What if my query results in a huge number of rows in the result set, for instance? Is there a way to ""sample"" data from the database, knowing that there are a large number of rows and that they are not uniformly distributed in time?

In short, how do I sample data from a database table, for the purposes of graphing/plotting the data?
