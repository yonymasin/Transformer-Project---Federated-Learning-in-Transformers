**Overview**: I'm creating a Stock Quotes Ticker app for Blackberry. But I'm having problems with my StringBuffer that contains an individual Stock information.

**Process**: My app connects to our server via SocketConnection. The server sends out a formatted set of strings that contains the latest Stock trade. So whenever a new trade happens, the server will send out an individual Stock Quote of that trade. Through an InputStream I am able to read that information and place each character in a StringBuffer that is referenced by Threads. By parsing based on ***char3*** I am able to determine a set of stock quote/information.

char1 - to separate data
char3 - means end of a stock quote/information

**sample stock quote format sent out by our server:**
stock_quote_name(char 1)some_data(char1)some_data(char1)(char3)

My app then parses that stock quote to compare certain data and formats it how it will look like when displayed in the screen. When trades happen gradually(slow) the app works perfectly. However..

**Problem**: When trades happen too quickly and almost at the same time, My app is not able to handle the information sent efficiently. The StringBuffer has its contents combined with the next trade. Meaning Two stock information in one StringBuffer.

I have developed an application which consumes web services. Web service response is a small amount of data (Not bulk data). I tested web service on good network (wifi and mobile internet [BIS]).
Application is working perfect, all the web service calls and response is perfect. But my application is also being used in areas where internet is slow (application is being used in different countries). In that case some times there is no response from the web service.
On some pages i show list of data that is fected from web service. (again i say, data is not huge)
Web service has response before the timeout, but still there is no data. (I am sure there is no filter on data)
In those areas, most of the time data is populated, but sometimes page is empty because there is no data in response.
User can browse web pages by using browser using the same internet connection. But faces problem in my application.
 
I know the problem is bad internet. I think somewhere in the transport layer, some packets of data are lost. and thats why in response there is no data. I am using HttpTransport. and web service .asmx.
 
What i expect from you all is, please suggest me some different protocol that ensures the arrivale of respose from web service. Or tell me if changing web service to WCF web service can effect the response.

-----
There are many questions on here about using JAR files in BlackBerry projects (see below). I have tried many solutions, but am still unable to package a project into a JAR and include it in another project. It seems there are many bugs in the RIM tools, and many workarounds that need to be done. I want to create a comprehensive (community?) post on how to do this once and for all.

Aim
-----
I want to package our BB libraries (v4.5 OR v5.0) into JAR format, so we can give application source code to clients WITHOUT giving library source code.

Platform
-----
I am using Eclipse 3.5 on Windows 7.

Workaround
---
Currently, I have my SDK, and my apps, all setup with source code, as different projects in the same workspace. All projects compile. My SDK is setup as a library project, my apps as applications.

In each app, I add the SDK project to the build path.

Eclipse handles the build perfectly, creates the various COD files. I copy & unzip the COD files into the same folder, run `updatejad` to combine the JAD files, and end up with many COD files that install perfectly.

Problem is - the library is required to be in source code.

Current Attempt
---

 1. I changed the SDK project to be an application (as per [Working with Libraries][1])
 2. I built the SDK project in Eclipse. I chose the Package Project menu option, and also Sign with Signature Tool option. (**Is this file considered preverified, or must I run `preverify` on it?**)
 3. I copied the resulting JAR file into my application project root folder.
 4. I unzipped the JAR file, and edited the manifest to remove the line `MicroEdition-Profile- MIDP-2.0` (as per [""Project {0} has to have a jad file file if it exports a mildlet jar"" error appears in BlackBerry Java Plug-in for Eclipse][2]). I rezipped the JAR file.
 5. I edited the build path - added the JAR file to my project. In the ""Order & Export"" tab, I checked the box to export this JAR file.


The app builds fine in Eclipse, and Packages fine using the BlackBerry plugin.

Current Problem
----
When I go to Sign the app, each COD file now needs to be signed by the RIMAPPSA2 signature.

I have tried to follow advice on this blog ([Frustrations with Blackberry Developer plugins for Eclipse][3]). Although it allows me to build & sign the app, I am unable to run it on the device since I get the error that it requires a secure api.

It seems like there is no actual license check in the app?  So as soon as a user copies the app from the device they can upload it to some pirate website as it will install on any device?

Now what is may be the height of video, the view is taking scroll and the text is only visible after scrolling. I am using a device of screen size 320X240px. I have even test with a video of 320X150px. But the text is not visible without scrolling, although there is lots of free space above and bottom of the video. What is problem in my code? How to solve it?

        }
    }

Now what is may be the height of video, the view is taking scroll and the text is only visible after scrolling. I am using a device of screen size 320X240px. I have even test with a video of 320X150px. But the text is not visible without scrolling, although there is lots of free space above and bottom of the video. What is problem in my code? How to solve it?

I'm asking because my app is basically an agregrator of a web service and goes down many levels and pushes many new screens. I think my problem is that I ""simulate"" a tab bar at the bottom, where I have a new tab bar are each screen as if it is just switching out screens. If I continuously uses the tabs aren't I just stacking screens on top of each other?

I know my ability to create a connection after using the app for awhile ceases to work. 

Is there a way to keep track of screens, or instead of pushing a screen, swap it out?
