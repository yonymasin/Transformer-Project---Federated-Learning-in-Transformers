For Web Developer

1. Some kind of industry framework (e.g; django)
2. Good asthatics
3. Good knowledge of CSS
4. Must know some javascripting library (e.g; jquery)
5. Databases

7. Project management skills and tools required for this (subversion, trac etc)
8. Business skills

I have only enlist what i have find most important skills required for the independent developer in web development (please help me complete this list) but i will really appreciate that if someone can also enlist all the skills required by independent GAME developer so that he/she can develop it without anyone help.

My colleagues invented our own file system because they ""guessed"" ext3 is fast enough.

-----

I am a lazy programmer.  Although I don't spent my working hours on SNS web sites, I like reading books.   Books about how to write better program, books about how to manage software project.  Everyday I spent some of my working hours on reading these books.  But finally I find I am just wasting my time.  I have no one to discuss what I learned, I am not allowed to try I've learned.  ""Design patterns?  Just something made thing more complicated.""  ""Stop playing, you little toys.  We are making something serious!""  Most of them had never read any book about programming in the last year.

-----

OK.  This is not a question really, just close it.  After some frustrating arguing today, I just felt sad.

I am tired of arguing, I am tired of coding in a way I consider stupid and inefficient, I am tired of working day after day with printf and scanf.   I need to change, either change my opinion about programming, or change my career.

Maybe my colleagues is right.  Maybe anyone who's more familiar with C99 standard could do a better job than me.   I should have chose another career.",1

At home I have 1 hr once I get back, which is spent revising. Obviously I have a lot more free time to code on the weekends, but that is still not enough especially when I compare that to the chance of coding every day at work, which I did in a previous job but left with valid reasons. If I did code everyday, I'd learn a lot.

While I have done coding at work, this is all provided and then changing the code to make optimisations which means that the code provided is poor and if that is in place somewhere, it also has to be changed (this is funny when my colleague says my code is messy yet he provided it to me). This also means that I learn very little because I may miss chances to do debugging, and there's many ways to do the same task. Programming on big projects is an issue as one big project is finished and then there is a gap for a few months till the next big project and until then, you might write the odd 100 lins here and there, but you've literally got free time. As the company does hosting, this sort of line of business/this industry means there's an orientation to support so I need to respond to tickets which are system admin related (firewall changes - not coding at all and this is not a transferable skill) while other members of the team do ASP.NET coding. And speaking of ASP.NET, we are hiring ASP.NET developers and I am wrapping up my revision on the ASP.NET exam by MS, so I can forget about doing any of that.

This makes me think that the whole idea that work = experience is rubbish. I took a day off work recently and I did so much stuff, that I didn't seem to match that productivity/level of business at work.

Also bare in mind, reading a lot doesn't leave a good impression on my boss as he said ""You read a lot and it doesn't look good if someone sees but if that's how you learn than that's fine with me"" (my boss is laidback like that and he means if senior management sees me constantly reading because we have to look ""busy"" - give the tasks and I won't need to act). Since then, it's always a bit awkward reading a lot at work but if there's nothing to do and future work is not yet approved then what can you do?

My main problem is if I don't do much coding here then in my next job the assumption that I have got experience will be expanded (this is not my first job and I am not a pure junior) and therefore any coding tasks I get I could find very difficult, unless I work efficently at home and do proper coding/testing/etc.

Some people will argue that it’s a good thing because it saves time. However putting this into the context of software I will say I disagree totally. In real life scenario, decisions are often made in a blink of an eye, the consequences are however extraordinary, in a disaster way. Whenever there’s a problem that needs to be solved the *Quick Thinker (QT)* always gets the most eyeballs because they appear to be surpassingly good to be able to answer the question straight away. *Thorough Thinker (TT)* will often sit back, think about the problem over and over again to come up with a proper solution however this will often require more time, but the end result is extraordinary, in an excellent way. But the world doesn’t work the most optimal way as we all know it and have made TT almost facing distinction (my experience has shown more people are shortsighted and this is how the world has become).

***Now the question is how I should balance between being a QT or a TT?*** If I spend too much on researching the solution my boss would often look down on me and think I’ve been wasting my time. If I spend as little time as possible and finish the problem quickly, all the shits will get back to me *pretty quickly* and end up rewriting most of it (spent more time, and the boss...). A good example can be doing TTD or not. I am kind of stuck in the middle that doing what I am being told and trying to do a better job.

I’m scheduled to graduate in the next year or two, and I realized I haven’t really been thinking much about the future.

This summer, I have been working at an University lab doing some small scale HPC/parallelism work, and StackOverflow has been a ridiculously awesome resource for me. I always try to answer a question or two after posting one of my own, but after spending (an increasingly larger) amount of time here at SO, I realized there are so many aspects of development I have no clue about.

I've always felt that the curriculum here at Berkeley is rigorous and will prepare me well for any kind of development job that I chose. I mean we have the (MIT clone) cs61a SICP scheme class that makes over 60% of the class cry. We also have some great professors that I've had great luck in taking classes with, who actually have worked in the field.

I always try to answer a question or two after posting one of my own, but after spending (an increasingly larger) amount of time here at SO, I realized there are so many aspects of development I have no clue about.

I've always felt that the curriculum here at Berkeley is rigorous and will prepare me well for any kind of development job that I chose. I mean we have the (MIT clone) cs61a SICP scheme class that makes over 60% of the class cry. We also have some great professors that I've had great luck in taking classes with, who actually have worked in the field.

For example, I feel I should

 1. Learn ASP.NET and .NET 3.0/3.5, because I already have pretty good experience with .NET 2.0/compact framework. and focus on learning T-SQL in depth.
 2. Learn J2EE technologies, and strengthen J2ME skills on mobile platform. Use JUnit extensively, focusing on test-driven-development.

The business analysts gather requirements / business problems to be solved with the clients and then discuss these requirements with me.

I base my decision on the current capabilities of the system, the overall impact that the solutions would have on the system and the estimated effort to implement them (as I was a developer of this same application for almost 3 years before I moved to this position, I’m confident in my estimates). The solutions are discussed iteratively with the business analysts until we agree that they are good. The outcome of this analysis is what we call the  “requirements design” document, which is written by me, shared with clients for approval and then also with the team that is going to implement the solutions and test them. Note that there are a few problems that I need to find a solution for that are non-functional. If the users are unhappy with the performance of a certain tool, I will investigate what can be done to speed it up. I will do some research – often based in the Java code itself - to identify possibilities of optimizations.

Both are respectable companies with leaders in their industry. IT & Logistics respectively. 

The IT based company is offering me an System Analyst role and the Logistics company is offering me a programmer role. Surprisingly the Programmer role is a much higher paid job at about 25% more than my current job and the Analyst role is about 10% higher than my current job.

I love programming and i enjoy every bit of it. I have some fears of not able to return to a programming role after accepting a System Analyst role. 

On the other hand, the Logistics company is using CGI-AWK and of course they are hiring me to work on CGI-AWK. My fear is that if i accept this role, i will be stuck to it and unable to move on to any other platforms or languages since CGI-AWK is really old school and i seriously doubt if any other company is using it.

I have the fiscal oppertunity right now to take a long-distance learning course, so i'm looking around for good options. There's no way i can go to real classes full-time, this is a case of wanting to learn something primarily for fun, and since i have the rare oppertunity to pour some cash into a real qualification in my hobby, i want to make it matter (so that in theory, if i really do get into this in a bigger way, i will have something to work with and help me down the line in a career).

however i'm not sure what this qualification even if. I want the course i take to be fun, as well as interesting.

- Is the ICS/GES (Gatlin Education Services) Certificate in Video Game Design and Development relevent, or heard of, has anybody taken this? Any comments? 

- Could anybody help point me to any other distance learning courses that might be of interest, and roughly fit my criteria, that are reccomended?

Recently, I decided to go back to school at nights as an insurance policy.  As I like computers and it seems like they are going to be around for a while, I enrolled as a compsci major.  I'm currently taking an Intro to Java course and I absolutely love it.  I thoroughly enjoy everything about programming and I hate to brag, but I'm pretty good at it.  I'm top in the class and I'm able to finish projects that take others hours in a fraction of the time (of course this isn't an ivy league school and I'm not purporting to be the next Bill Gates).  But I feel like this might be what I was put here to do.

Career Suicide?,"I'm a contract developer and have been for the most part of 14 years.  I just took a stateside lead developer role managing a small offshore team of developers.

Strike 1 was the environment... lots of contractors slammed into a small 16'x14' room.  Seating is at tables.  Hardware is so-so.  I was able to overcome this by using my own laptop.

Strike 2 was the actual job.  After I accepted it was presented that I would be spending the first month or so writing up tech specs -- not something I've normally done as that was handled by a permanent developer.  But ok... I hate it, but I can do it.

Waiting on the next pitch to see if this is strike 3.  But most of the current development is done on Visual studio 2003.  Yep.  Not 2005, not 2008, but 2003!  .NET 1.1.  What?!?  I have suggested repeatedly 2008 for several of its features will make the task easier.  But I get the ""budget"" reasons, etc. etc. etc.  It's not yet a ""NO"", but not yet a ""YES"" either.

So my main question.  If they decide to do this in VS 2003 and I spend six months using outdated technology, have I committed career suicide?  Recruiters always want to know what version of what you used on each job... and I'm an honest guy.   So six months from now, having been ""behind the times"" instead of ""staying current""... does this community think that I've hurt my career?  Since there was a lot of unintentional bait and switch going on, would I be wise to seek something else ASAP?  I can live with #1 and #2.  #3 I'm not so sure of.

I had many pet projects and though I didn't finish any of them, I learnt a lot designing and writing them. I also read many programming blogs and news sites regularly.

Two weeks ago I got my first job as a programmer and started working with great enthusiasm. All of my colleagues, including my bosses, are extremely talented coders (as far as I can judge). I think I'm very lucky to work with them - it is rare to find such competent people, especially at a governmental organization in Hungary. The only thing I don't really like is how some of them look down on some less gifted programmers in another office they have to work with.

My first tasks were easy and though I felt I was a bit slow because I had to do some research, I completed them on time and my bosses seemed to be more or less satisfied with what I made.

Let's start by saying that I absolutely love programming and have been doing it since my early childhood. I had many pet projects and though I didn't finish any of them, I learnt a lot designing and writing them. I also read many programming blogs and news sites regularly.

Two weeks ago I got my first job as a programmer and started working with great enthusiasm. All of my colleagues, including my bosses, are extremely talented coders (as far as I can judge). I think I'm very lucky to work with them - it is rare to find such competent people, especially at a governmental organization in Hungary. The only thing I don't really like is how some of them look down on some less gifted programmers in another office they have to work with.

My first tasks were easy and though I felt I was a bit slow because I had to do some research, I completed them on time and my bosses seemed to be more or less satisfied with what I made.
