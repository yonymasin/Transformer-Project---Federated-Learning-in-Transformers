 - **Code a lot** I've written several hobby projects, had part time jobs, entered the Imagine cup from Microsoft, took programming extensive courses and did freelance gigs.
 - **Read a lot** I've bought most top books from the recommended book topics here, to be honest I have not read them all.
 - **learn different languages** I've tried several languages including Haskell, Java, Python, Ruby, Lisp, Prolog, C#, PHP, JS, AS3 and possibly some more I forgot.
 - **Tried to start a blog** [Joel][1] recommends to learn how to write, I tried starting a couple of blogs to improve upon this, I gave up on all instances after writing about three posts. It was just not my thing...

 - Learn and memorize the usage of the low level API's of your favorite language
 - Polish your portfolio

I rather not spend my time on those first two points, but I have to be realistic and thats just my experience on what kind of questions you'll get when you apply. The third point is my hope that I won't have to answer questions about the amount of standard types in c# for example if they can see I get projects done and launched.

But I'm still graduating, so I don't know anything :), and many of you might be hiring grads on a recent base and could tell me and other interested people what you wish that the recent grads you interviewed would have done before they applied.

Developers vs Management ,"I hope that I'm not the only one and I can get a answer from someone with more experience than me, so I can think cleaner and I don't get depressed with this developer's life.

I'm working as developer for a small company three years now. In that three years I'm working in the same project and sincerely, I think this project could be used as a *CASE STUDY* because it has all the situations that cannot happen in a project and that makes a project fails.

To begin with, and I believe you've already noticed, the project has 3 years already (develoment only) and is still unfinished, because in every meeting there is a ""new priority"" ,or a ""new problem"" to be solve or a ""new feature"" to be add. 
So, first problem is no *target set*. How can you know when something is finished if you don't know what you want? I understand Management, because they see an oportunity and try to get that, but I don't understand how can they not see (or hear us) that they'll lose all they already have and what they'll eventually get.

Second, there is *no team group*. My team consists of three people, a Senior Developer, a DBA and, finally, I for all the work (support, testing, new features, bug fixing, meeting, projet management of clients, etc) aka Junior Developer. 
The first (senior developer), does not perform any tests on his changes, so, most of the time, his changes give us problems (us = me, since I'm the one who will fix it). 
The second (DBA) is an uncompromising person and you can not talk to him, believe me, I tried! In his view, everything he does is fantastic... even if it is the most complicated to make it... And he does everything he wants, even if we need that only for 5 months later and would help some extra-hand to do the things we have to do for **now**.
As you can see, there is very hard to work with no help...

Third, there is *no testings*. Every... I repeat, Every release of the project, the customers wants to kill us, because there is a lot of bugs. Management? They say that they want tests before the release. Us? We say the same. Time? No time. Management? There is always some time to open the application and click in some buttons. Us? Try to explain that it is not so simple. Management doesn't care... end of story. 
Actually, must of the bugs could be avoid with a rigorous work... Some people just want to do the show to the Management. ""Did you ask for this? Cool, it's done. Bugs? The *Do-all-the-work* guy will solve."" Unfortunally for me, sometimes the *Do-all-the-work* also has to finish it. And to makes this all better, I'm the person who will listen the complaints from the customers. Cool, huh?

I know, everyone makes mistakes. But there is mistakes and mistakes... 

To complete, in the Management view, ""the problem is the lack of an individual project management"", because we cannot do all the stuff they ask, even if there is no PM for the project itself. And ask us to work overtime without any reward...

I do say all this stuff to the management and others members, but by telling this, the I'm the *bad guy*, the guy who is complain when everything is going well... but we need to work overtime... *sigh*

What can I do to make it works? Anyone has a situation like this, what did you do?

I hope you could understand my problem, my English is a little rusty.

(5) and how can I understand what previous programmer coded ???????
",career-development,,,,,01/26/2012 21:43:44,not constructive,1,106,9,"SE - Pressure and Business Process in software profession I am currently working as a trainee programmer in a software farm. I am somewhat frustrated and considering abandoning this profession.

I don't agree with the most of the answers of this post.
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/362376/why-did-you-choose-programming-as-a-profession

Can anyone answer the following questions?

(1) Is pressure inherent to Software Programming?

(2) Is it mandatory for a programmer to grasp the total business process (like the System Analyst) relating to the software he is working with?


(3) Is maintenance-coding a part and parcel of this profession?

(4) How can I explore new technologies while being involved understanding Business Processes (Coz these two are separate in nature)?

He has a degree in a non-computer science engineering discipline from a very good university, but no actual qualifications in computer science.

He aspires one day to perhaps working for the likes of google, microsoft, fog creek, [insert equivalent here].

This guy is working on an implementation of a C# compiler in a functional language as a personal project firstly to teach himself about what it's like to implement an industrial-strength language from ground up, not to mention the advantages of functional programming. On top of this, however, this guy thinks this might look good on his resume when trying to get aforementioned work.

This guy is teaching himself fundamentals in his spare time (algorithms, software engineering, compiler theory, etc.), so isn't afraid of theory.

The question is - how on earth can this guy get where he wants to go? He is *very* passionate about programming but feels incredible despair at the prospect of doing CRUD for the rest of his life.

Possibilities this person has considered are: contributing to open source, correspondence degree, masters top-up course on top of non-CS degree, crying himself to sleep every night.
