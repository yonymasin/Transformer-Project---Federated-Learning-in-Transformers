Through my own experience and long debates with colleagues, I've come to realize that [singletons are not always desirable][2] - they can make testing more difficult (by inhibiting techniques like mocking) and can create undesirable coupling between parts of a system.

Great! Code is thread-safe if it operates in thread-safe manner! It's a very, very informative definition!

My proposition -- specifically for stackoverflow tag wiki -- is the following:

**Basically, thread-safety means that program's observable behavior does not depend on eligible thread scheduling order.**

Still, it is a very basic definition. Say, threads may log  messages into log file, and reodering of log messages may be OK. So program observable behavior may vary, but the program may be considered thread-safe.  

Probably, we need to specify allowed types of different program observable behaviors while being thread-safe. Yet another complication: there may be  thread-safe (or thread-unsafe) code, not the whole program.

Note, that tag wiki definition is limited in size. So it may be possible that my concise definition is OK, despite its minor imprecision.

However I feel that this distinction should be more implementation specific than it is a defining feature of the language itself.

Wikipedia describes [C++ as a *compiled* language][1] and [Perl as *interpreted*][2]. It is not the only place I've come across which makes similar definitions.


The distinction becomes much more obscure, when considering the following points:

 - C [can be interpreted][3] 

 - The main implementations of common general-purpose programming languages (Python, C#, Java, ...) will compile source to bytecode targeted at a virtual machine. I understand Clang+LLVM tries to do the same for C code.

 - Some modern languages like Go or Lua, will include both an interpreter and a compiler in their official distribution.


Therefore, I am tempted to believe that every programming language can be either interpreted or compiled. On the other hand, I know virtually nothing about writing a compiler so I thought best to ask here:

**Are there any features or characteristics preventing a programming language from being interpreted (and vice-versa) or is it safe to assume that the distinction is only bound to the implementation of the language?**

The distinction between an interpreter and a compiler is largely understood. However I feel that this distinction should be more implementation specific than it is a defining feature of the language itself.

Wikipedia describes [C++ as a *compiled* language][1] and [Perl as *interpreted*][2]. It is not the only place I've come across which makes similar definitions.


The distinction becomes much more obscure, when considering the following points:

 - C [can be interpreted][3] 

 - The main implementations of common general-purpose programming languages (Python, C#, Java, ...) will compile source to bytecode targeted at a virtual machine. I understand Clang+LLVM tries to do the same for C code.
