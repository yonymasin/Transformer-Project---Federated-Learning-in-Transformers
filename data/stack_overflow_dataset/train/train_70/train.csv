While at the Gym the other day, I was working with my combination lock, and realized something that would be useful to me as a programmer.

These examples *seem* easy to remember. 


###Question

How would I implement something similar for passwords?  Yes, they ought to be hard to crack, but they also should be easy for the end user to remember.

This question is language-agnostic, but if there's a specific implementation for C#, I'd be glad to hear of it.

 - The Password should be easy to remember. `Dog!Wolf` is easy to remember, but once an attacker knows that your website gives out that combination, it makes it infinitely easier to check.

Now to the problem. I want to control so that the full path is always a subdirectory of the static base path. In other words I don't want the user to supply a path such that the base path is escaped.

The following full path is OK:

A heisenbug (named after the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle) is a computer bug that disappears or alters its characteristics when an attempt is made to study it.



Does anyone encountered such a tricky bugs in his code? Can you provide with some real life examples?

  - Learn it
  - Build some web apps to learn it better
  - Try to learn as much as possible about the Lang-X/Framework
  - Start job searches on Monster for ""Lang-X/Framework Developer"" and applying.

 1. Am I severely limiting my career choices by focusing on solely web development? If so, is that bad?

 2. Is focusing on one language/framework a good idea, in your opinion? Or should I spread my time/energy around and always be trying new languages/frameworks?

So my question is...

 1. How can I use programming to increase my chances of getting into this school? I have heard from multiple sources that you can get into a school with low grades if you can prove you excel in the subject you plan on taking, like being a good programmer...
 2. If this is the case, then what would be the best category of programming to get better at so that I can prove that I'm not a useless lazy highschool kid.

*We have a set of base methods that we want our derived calsses to implement.* - Use interfaces.  

*We have some common functionality we want to share with the derived classes.* - Use static methods or create a helper class.

*We want to add a bit of functionally to a class.* Use composition / Write a wrapper around the object.

 > Robustness is the ability of a system to continue to run after it detects an error.  Often an architecture specifies a more robust system than that specified by the requirements.  One reason is that a system composed of many parts that are minimally robust might be less robust than is required overall.  In software, the chain isn't as strong as its weakest link; it's as weak as all the weak links multiplied together.  The architecture should clearly indicate whether programmers should err on the side of overengineering or on the side of doing the simplest thing that works.

(note that the text above should be covered under fair use and thus not break any copyrights)

I'm a bit confused as to what McConnell means here as he doesn't ever elaborate on the subject (as far as I can tell).  Is he trying to say that overengineering is good in the context of handling errors or is he saying something else?

Point in case: a few weeks ago, I stumbled across a piece of code where one of my fellow colleagues tried to store boolean values in a database. The database consisted of a large XML file with about 1.000.000 items. In a loop over the database items, he repeatedly

<li>read the whole XML file</li>
<li>parsed the XML, storing the result in a map</li>
<li>modified exactly one element of the map</li>
