How to transfer SSL EV?,"I'm confused a little bit with my problem, so I don't know if I have to start the migration from the hosting provider #1 to the hosting provider #2 **(#1->#2)**.
Everything is good to migrate, but SSL EV certificate... 

Now I'm on #1 (Unix/Apache, shared hosting plan) and have an SSL EV certificate.
I'm' thinking of moving to #2 (the same Unix/Apache, shared hosting plan), because of some reasons.
The problem is SSL EV certificate migration. 

Could anybody explain me the process of transfering ov SSL EV certificate?

**Additional info:**
I was told by the customer representative from #2, that I have to request the CSR withing my AMP, then provide this to #1, so that #1 can provide me a Certificate that matches that key.

Customer representative from #1 says migration of SSL EV is not a very simple process and would highly recommend me to hire someone for help (but, I believe the reason could be to stop me from migration).
Can I do it on my own by following the instructions? Is that's too complicated? Do you know how to do that (to migrate with SSL EV for dummies)?
Both new and old hostings are shared hostings with Unix/Apache/MySQL.


So, is a migration of SSL EV certificate so complicated that it should stop me?

P.S. The project is not alilve right now, so I downloaded the files&db to my computer for future migration.

Is the process so complicated and expensive (to hire someone who can help -$500? $1000?), so it's easier to get a new SSL EV certificate (from the very beginning - $100..$300 + several days up to 2 weeks it took when I got one)?

Now all other pages are fine, but when i pass 

www.example.com/classified/autos4x4s/mitsubishi/lancer/2011/3/12/lanc

er-2002-in-good-condition-14/ it always goes to Listing page (ads.php) not to detail page.

Any help would be appreciated.

    *.domain.ru
    
    (where * - can be some subdomain)

I'm developing this project in development server but i should test in before publish in production server. So, i did added in hosts (127.0.0.1 *my domain list*) and made virtualhost in apache:

    <VirtualHost *:80>
    	ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
    	ServerName domain.com
            ServerAlias domain.ru domain.nl ....................

        ......................

But this is bad way, because when i need have a look at website in production, i need delete my hosts and then paste it again.

I have production server which is running website. I have many domains which connected to one virtualhost in Apache. For example:

    domain.com
    domain.ru
    domain.nl
    m.domain.com

    m.domain.nl
    *.domain.com
    *.domain.nl
    *.domain.ru
    
    (where * - can be some subdomain)

I'm developing this project in development server but i should test in before publish in production server. So, i did added in hosts (127.0.0.1 *my domain list*) and made virtualhost in apache:

    <VirtualHost *:80>
    	ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
    	ServerName domain.com
            ServerAlias domain.ru domain.nl ....................
    	
    	DocumentRoot /var/www/domain/web
        ......................

But this is bad way, because when i need have a look at website in production, i need delete my hosts and then paste it again.

Two such programs are Collabnet SubversionEdge and Adobe Version Cue.  Any variation on the case of the user name results in another user entry in those packages. And this user will have no access, frustrating the person, and clogging the help desk with tickets.

Collabnet Subversion Edge uses Apache 2.2 so I intend to intercept the url and rewrite the username to enforced lowercase at the server-side.

    https://User:password@svn.domain.com
    https://USER@svn.domain.com
    svn://useR:password@svn.domain.com/Repo/Trunk/BIN/

Notice that the rest of the url is unchanged.

When going to the server IP address, I get a HTTP 500 error. I asked a friend who is a linux/unix admin and he pointed me in the right direction, but I need some more assistance to figure this out. Please help!

Steps I took for migration:
1.Backed up the mysql database

2.Created .tar backup using vcf command in ssh - was in /var/www/vhosts/sitename.com (name removed - unfortunately, I didn't use -su beforehand, so I am pondering if this is a user rights issue)

2.unpackaged the files on the new server, and created blank database using same database name / user name/ pw, then imported the old database.

3. Tested site via server IP in browser - received HTTP 500 error

Steps I took for resolution:
1. Checked httpd.conf file : port listen 80 was fine, noticed document root was DocumentRoot ""/var/www/html"" so checked old httpd.conf file and seemed to be the same, but tried putting in /var/www/vhosts/sitename.com (name removed) and restarted apache - still HTTP 500 error

2. Copied original httpd.conf file and replaced on new server. Restarted apache and still same problem

3. Checked apache logs - got some weird stuff in there, but I'm not good at making sense out of most of the data on there - here's some recent stuff on there:

When going to the server IP address, I get a HTTP 500 error. I asked a friend who is a linux/unix admin and he pointed me in the right direction, but I need some more assistance to figure this out. Please help!

Steps I took for migration:
1.Backed up the mysql database

2.Created .tar backup using vcf command in ssh - was in /var/www/vhosts/sitename.com (name removed - unfortunately, I didn't use -su beforehand, so I am pondering if this is a user rights issue)

2.unpackaged the files on the new server, and created blank database using same database name / user name/ pw, then imported the old database.

3. Tested site via server IP in browser - received HTTP 500 error

Steps I took for resolution:
1. Checked httpd.conf file : port listen 80 was fine, noticed document root was DocumentRoot ""/var/www/html"" so checked old httpd.conf file and seemed to be the same, but tried putting in /var/www/vhosts/sitename.com (name removed) and restarted apache - still HTTP 500 error

2. Copied original httpd.conf file and replaced on new server. Restarted apache and still same problem

3. Checked apache logs - got some weird stuff in there, but I'm not good at making sense out of most of the data on there - here's some recent stuff on there:

Directory /var/www/parent contains a bunch of subdirectories and some files. Almost everything needs to be protected for some individual users, so I've set up a ""Require user"" directive which accomplishes this.

However, I want one of the subdirectories of /var/www/parent to have open access to all comers, with an individual subdomain that points to it. I can't figure out how to do override the ""Require user"" directive in /var/www/parent.

So the desired structure is:

 - /var/www/parent accessed by parent.mydomain.com should be protected.
 - /var/www/parent/closedchild accessed by parent.mydomain.com/closedchild should be protected (as should several versions of this with other names)
 - /var/www/parent/openchild accessed by openchild.mydomain.com should be open

Any ideas on how to achieve this easily without having to put in a separate directive for every possible value of `<closedchild>`?

Current directive on /var/www/parent looks like:

    <Directory ""/var/www/parent"">
    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
    AllowOverride All

Third, the database is PostgreSql along with Apache DBCP pooling.

Fourth, the maven jdbc driver dependencies seems to work well, as again if they didn't vFabric tc Server would also fail same as Apache Tomcat which leads to me to an idea that Apache Tomcat is itself the culprit.

It is a Bug? is it a problem with fastCGI? Where do i set that up?

I made it a goal of mine to setup a Ubuntu server cloud with the front server being a high powered desktop box and the first node being a micro server.  The more I learned about server clouds the more I realized my knowledge was lacking.  So, I'm left with many questions that I believe only a system admin could answer directly and concisely.

A Ubuntu server cloud is a cluster of nodes that have virtual machines (VM)s running so that a user may balance the load of tasks across multiple VMs???  So in other words a server environment that has 2 mysql servers and 2 file servers totaling 5 servers (+1 for load balancer) may not be using all the server power efficiently...  The mysql servers may only use 60% of the computing power while the file servers use 100% and are sometimes slow...  By taking the 5 machines and creating a Ubuntu cloud you can utilise all the computing power.  So that configuration would have each file server being a single VM and the mysql servers each being 2 VMs???  So that the excess computing power on the mysql server could be used as a file server???  I am trying to figure out the cloud environment conceptually for a single website and not a hosting platform...  Does this sound correct?  How does the data fully exists (still) when some nodes go down?

I always thought of cloud computing as a sort of super computer...  IE, multiple machines connecting together acting like a single giant super machine.  Ubuntu cloud though, doesn't span VMs across nodes.  So...  instead for a single website, each node will have a single VM unless separate VMs are needed to act as independent servers.  Isn't that nearly identical to Apache Load Balancing?  Is there any real benefit for a Ubuntu cloud when hosting a single website? Or even just a couple sites...

Now an Apache Load Balancing setup...  For large scale websites it is beneficial to have multiple server clusters in multiple places.  The computing power of multiple nodes is used to server client users independently of each other.  Users will access the server closest to them based on availability (handled by load balancing server).  So... multiple servers (nodes) in different locations handling tasks for users...  Right?  I'm very confused about how this setup is actually maintained with the same data (redundant) across all the servers.  Does someone deploy the same web files across all the servers, or does the load balancer handle this task?  The load balancer determines which mysql server to use?

The final confusion comes from figuring out whether to use a Ubuntu cloud at all.  Is this technology specifically reserved for shared hosting environments?  I was under the impression that if you have a lot of servers in a cloud then loads are balanced across these nodes by the front node???  Im confused by the concept of how more machines are utilised when server load increases...  Does the front node automatically ask for more VMs that are then added to the balancing act?  Is that process automated?  If so, then is a Ubuntu server cloud a complete replacement for an Apache Load Balancing cluster setup?  Do the Ubuntu nodes have the capability of living in different geographical locations serving clients accordingly?  Or is there a hybrid setup?  Apache Load Balancing of separate Ubuntu clouds forming one giant cloud?

Ohh boy... :/  Sorry for the long post, but I have many questions and I'm having trouble finding the right material to connect all the dots.  Your help is much appreciated!

Basically redirect everything with certain filetypes and preserving the structure of the URL, like flv etc.

I tried something but I am getting a redirect looping error. Could someone help me out?

Thank you!",5

The domain has a collection of applications installed that each have their own sub-domain. Eg: domain.com, app1.domain.com, app2.domain.com, app3.domain.com

I'd love to have a single sign-on solution so they don't have to authenticate themselves for each application. Also, the applications are written in different languages (PHP, Python and Perl) so authenticating users through an Apache module is ideal.

I am new to digest authentication, but it seems like a good solution. I have used `htdigest` to create my users. I have configured my domain and sub-domains (See below).

If I go to the domain or any of the sub-domains it will prompt for a username and password. If I enter a correct username and password, it will authenticate me and the page will load. However, if I go to another sub-domain, it will ask for me to enter a username and password again. If I enter the same username and password, it will work.

So the password file is OK, and authentication is OK, but the problem seems to lie in the configuration of the `AuthDigestDomain`.

I have searched all over the net to find an example of using Digest authentication on multiple domains, but I cannot find a specific example that solves my problem.

I am hoping someone here can assist. Do I put the same authentication information in every `Directory`? Should I be using `Directory` or `Location` or `Files`? Have I missed something all-together?

We've got Apache 2.2.11 running mod_php 5.2.9-2 on a Windows Server 2003 (Small Business Edition) box, and each request spikes somewhere around 4 to 8MB of RAM, followed by approximately 2 to 6MB of freeing. Basically, the amount Apache releases is always notably less (by megabytes) than the amount it allocates during the request, and after a few hours the httpd.exe process ends up consuming all available RAM and the server hangs.

This behaviour **doesn't** occur at all on our Windows XP development boxes with the same codebase and following configs:

 - XP/Apache 2.2.11/PHP5.2.9-2/MySQL 5.1.34
 - XP/Apache 2.0.x (various)/PHP5.2.7/MySQL 5.0.67

Simple PHP scripts on the production server (Win2k3) don't appear to leak e.g:

 - Basic PHP echo functions
 - Creating and referencing classes
 - Output buffering
 - PDO with and without persistent connections

When running our full app, however, things start to leak. The only things we can think of that would cause this are the use of objects, session details, global variables - but how can I find out what the leak is? And what's causing it? Without disrupting too much the only machine we can duplicate the issue on??

But it is resulting into:

    /test/f=foo&amp;bar,baz

I do not know where this `&amp;` coming from.

Thanks.",3
