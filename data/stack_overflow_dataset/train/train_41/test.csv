I can split them into frequently-accessed and infrequently-accessed, and it works out cheapest to keep the frequent ones at my main webhost, and the less frequent ones (lower bandwidth) on Rackspace Cloudfiles.

Anyway, after moving 100,000 files across, I set up a database table with all of the ""before"" and ""afters"" in it.

If a search engine etc requests a file on the old URL, it gets bounced to my 404 page, which then does a lookup in the database to find the new URL, where possible.  I then serve it up with a 301 header, so hopefully they'll get the message in the end and stop looking in the wrong place.

The problem is, all of these then get logged as ""file does not exist"" in my error_log.  Which annoys the OCD in me, and makes it harder to spot genuine errors.

I can understand why they end up there, what would you suggest I do to better solve this problem?

You can see that the database and all connections are working at http://bradp.com/index.php, however http://bradp.com/home.html does not work as it relies on the .htaccess file to parse the URL. 

I copied the identical htaccess file from bradppresents.com (currently working fine) to bradp.com and I get ""Internal server error"" when the file is present. As soon as it is deleted the error goes away, but of course the site does not work as needed.

I'm hoping someone can shine a little light on this for me.

Here's the .htaccess file

    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteBase /
    
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} (/|\.htm|\.php|\.html|\.aspx|\.asp|/[^.]*)$  [NC]

    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
    RewriteRule (.*) index.php

    RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} mosConfig_[a-zA-Z_]{1,21}(=|\%3D) [OR]
    # Block out any script trying to base64_encode crap to send via URL

It's essentially the default file with a few changes. 

I really appreciate any help I can get;

As such it is a simple website based on AMP [***apache***,***Mysql*** and ***PHP***]. The code is near complete but as soon as i run the website with regards to email sending option and things, i get numerous errors. i have noted that my **apache** webserver is not connecting to the internet.

i am in my college hostel behind a squid proxy server [setup in the college]. i have to use the squid proxy to use the internet.

i see that when ever i am try to do tutorials related with sending data and fetching from the outside [the internet], i get many errors. its now that i am coming to the conclusion that my apache webserver is not able to see the outside world.

i tried uploading the website files to an experimental hosting site, and it is able to parse from other websites. the website works on the hosting website but not on my laptop.

so my questions is this, when i tried making a simple rss reader, why is that my **apache** on the **WAMP** thing is not able to work? why do get many errors? where do i have to config for the apache webserver to make it work? as in getting it to parse the websites of the outside world.

whats with the DNS and stuff? i want to know how to host my own website from the **apache** [WAMP] that i have on ly laptop and that too behind this baffling squid proxy... 

wish i had a direct internet. i wish to know more in detail because my project is being delayed because of the proxy thing. i know its much easier to upload the entire site online on a demo hosting site. but then again i have problems uploading. i wish to setup my WAMP server to work online so that i dont have to upload and stuff. what should i do?

I have my server.crt and server.key files in conf/ssl.crt


I am not able to access https://localhost with this configuration.

When i checked if there's a service listening on port 443 using netstat -aon, i did not see anything running on 443. I am able to access http://localhost and there is a service running on port 80.

When i tried apache.exe -D SSL from the command prompt, i get this error

(OS 10048)Only one usage of each socket address (protocol/network address/port)
is normally permitted.  : make_sock: could not bind to address 0.0.0.0:80
no listening sockets available, shutting down
Unable to open logs

When i tried openssl s_client -connect localhost:443 -state -debug from command prompt, i get this

Loading 'screen' into random state - done
connect: Bad file descriptor
connect:errno=10061


What is the problem with my configuration?",3

    #
    # This is the main Apache HTTP server configuration file.  It contains the
    # configuration directives that give the server its instructions.
    # See <URL:http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2> for detailed information.
    # In particular, see 
    # <URL:http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/directives.html>
    # for a discussion of each configuration directive.
    #
    # Do NOT simply read the instructions in here without understanding
    # what they do.  They're here only as hints or reminders.  If you are unsure
    # consult the online docs. You have been warned.  
    #
    # Configuration and logfile names: If the filenames you specify for many
    # of the server's control files begin with ""/"" (or ""drive:/"" for Win32), the
    # server will use that explicit path.  If the filenames do *not* begin
    # with ""/"", the value of ServerRoot is prepended -- so ""logs/foo.log""
    # with ServerRoot set to ""C:/Program Files/Apache Software Foundation/Apache2.2"" will be interpreted by the
    # server as ""C:/Program Files/Apache Software Foundation/Apache2.2/logs/foo.log"".
    #
    # NOTE: Where filenames are specified, you must use forward slashes
    # instead of backslashes (e.g., ""c:/apache"" instead of ""c:\apache"").
    # If a drive letter is omitted, the drive on which httpd.exe is located
    # will be used by default.  It is recommended that you always supply
    # an explicit drive letter in absolute paths to avoid confusion.
    
    #
    # ServerRoot: The top of the directory tree under which the server's
    # configuration, error, and log files are kept.
    #
    # Do not add a slash at the end of the directory path.  If you point
    # ServerRoot at a non-local disk, be sure to point the LockFile directive
    # at a local disk.  If you wish to share the same ServerRoot for multiple
    # httpd daemons, you will need to change at least LockFile and PidFile.
    #
    ServerRoot ""C:/Program Files/Apache Software Foundation/Apache2.2""
    
    #
    # Listen: Allows you to bind Apache to specific IP addresses and/or
    # ports, instead of the default. See also the <VirtualHost>
    # directive.
    #
    # Change this to Listen on specific IP addresses as shown below to 
    # prevent Apache from glomming onto all bound IP addresses.

",apache,ssl,configuration,https,httpd.conf,07/21/2012 06:00:57,off topic,1,4630,3,"SSLEngine On causing I'm currently trying to run an apache server with a certain webapp(Shibboleth/SAML service provider) on it and I have to enable SSL for the provider to run correctly. However, whenever I uncomment the ""SSLEngine on"" directive in httpd.conf(in Apache2.2\conf\ directory), the apache server fails. I have a .crt and a .key file generated and in my \conf\ directory so I don't think that this is the problem. Below is my httpd.conf file; any help would be appreciated!

    #
    # This is the main Apache HTTP server configuration file.  It contains the
    # configuration directives that give the server its instructions.
    # See <URL:http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2> for detailed information.
    # In particular, see 
    # <URL:http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/directives.html>
    # for a discussion of each configuration directive.
    #
    # Do NOT simply read the instructions in here without understanding
    # what they do.  They're here only as hints or reminders.  If you are unsure
    # consult the online docs. You have been warned.  
    #
    # Configuration and logfile names: If the filenames you specify for many
    # of the server's control files begin with ""/"" (or ""drive:/"" for Win32), the
    # server will use that explicit path.  If the filenames do *not* begin
    # with ""/"", the value of ServerRoot is prepended -- so ""logs/foo.log""
    # with ServerRoot set to ""C:/Program Files/Apache Software Foundation/Apache2.2"" will be interpreted by the
    # server as ""C:/Program Files/Apache Software Foundation/Apache2.2/logs/foo.log"".
    #
    # NOTE: Where filenames are specified, you must use forward slashes
    # instead of backslashes (e.g., ""c:/apache"" instead of ""c:\apache"").
    # If a drive letter is omitted, the drive on which httpd.exe is located
    # will be used by default.  It is recommended that you always supply
    # an explicit drive letter in absolute paths to avoid confusion.
    
    #
    # ServerRoot: The top of the directory tree under which the server's
    # configuration, error, and log files are kept.
    #
    # Do not add a slash at the end of the directory path.  If you point
    # ServerRoot at a non-local disk, be sure to point the LockFile directive
    # at a local disk.  If you wish to share the same ServerRoot for multiple
    # httpd daemons, you will need to change at least LockFile and PidFile.
    #
    ServerRoot ""C:/Program Files/Apache Software Foundation/Apache2.2""
    
    #
    # Listen: Allows you to bind Apache to specific IP addresses and/or
    # ports, instead of the default. See also the <VirtualHost>
    # directive.
    #
    # Change this to Listen on specific IP addresses as shown below to 
    # prevent Apache from glomming onto all bound IP addresses.
