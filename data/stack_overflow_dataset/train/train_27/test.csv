Users:
int player_id
varchar player_name

Games:
int game_id
int player_id1
int player_id2

I want to make a query that takes in a player id as a parameter, and returns info on each game, along with the player's name.  So far, what I have is the following:

SELECT game_id, player_id1, player_id2, from GAMES, GAME_STATES where player_id1=@playerid or player_id2=@playerid

The part I'm stuck at is a simple way to have it return the names of players along with the player ids.  The returning query would have 5 columns, one of the game id, two for each player id, and two for each of their names.

One solution I thought of is

SELECT game_id, player_id1, (select player_name from USERS where player_id=player_id1) as player_name1, player_id2, (select player_name from USERS where player_id=player_id2) as player_name2, from GAMES, GAME_STATES where player_id1=@playerid or player_id2=@playerid

However, this seems like a lot of extra work on the database since there would be 2 more queries per row returned.  If I have to do that, I'm wondering if making requests for names as a second query on the client side is a better option.  Then the client could create a list of unique ids, and do one query for all of them.  I'm not too worried about latency since the client and server are in the same data center.

Thank you for your help.

The basic gist of it is that when a query is made to an external source through <cfquery> or <cfhttp> or any other external request like that it passes the external request on to a specific driver and at that point CF itself is unable to suspend it. Even if a timeout is specified on the query or in the cfsetting it is flatly ignored for all external requests. 

http://www.coldfusionmuse.com/index.cfm/2009/6/9/killing.threads

So with that in mind the issue we've run into is that somehow the communication between our CF server and our mySQL server sometimes goes awry and leaves behind hung threads. They have the following characteristics.

1. The hung thread shows up in CF and cannot be killed from FusionReactor.
2. There is *no* hung thread visible in mySQL, and no active running query (just the usual sleeps).
3. The database is responding to other calls and appears to be operating correctly.
4. Max connections have not been reached for the DB nor the user.

It seems to me the only likely candidate is that somehow CF is making a request, mySQL is responding to that request but with an answer which CF ignores and continues to keep the thread open waiting for a response from mySQL. That would explain why the database seems to show no signs of problems, but CF keeps a thread open waiting for the mysterious answer.

*Usually* these hung threads appear randomly on otherwise working scripts (such as posting a comment on a news article). Even while one thread is hung for that script, other requests for that script will go through, which would imply that the script isn't neccessarily at fault, but rather the condition faced when the script was executed.

We ran some test to determine that it was not a mysql generated max_connections error... we created a user, gave it 1 max connections, tied that connection with a sleep(1000) query and executed another query. Unfortunately, it correctly errored out without generating a hung thread.

So, I'm left at this point with absolutely no clue what is going wrong. Is there some other connection limit or timeout which could be causing the communication between the servers to go awry?

However, I can't figure out how to handle the case where Ted doesn't have a space in his point_title field.  The pseudo_key value for that record is just '126'.

Does anyone have an idea for this?

 2. **Table Blocking**, When information is updated during busy times of the day or week, (because I'm using MyIsam tables) queries are blocked and this can cause further issues (connections running out, worse performance)

I'm using Hibernate (3.5.2), Mysql 5.0 (all MyIsam tables) and Java 1.6

I'd like some specific suggestions (preferrably based on concrete experience) about exactly what would be the best way to update the the denormalized table.

The following come to my mind

1. Create a denormalized table with the **InnoDb** type  so that I get **row** level locking rather than table locking
2. Create triggers on the properly normalized tables that update the denormalized table,

1. Gotchas - things that I may not be thinking about that will affect my desired result.
2. Specific MySql settings that may improve performance, reduce blocking on the denormalized table.

Unfortunately, I have no idea where to start!

I'm running a DirectAdmin-based CentOS dedicated server. It's an Intel Quad Core 3Ghz with 8Gb RAM. I run a number of websites on it, but I believe only my main website gets any real traffic.

The website that I'm concerned about is hitting around 30,000 unique visitors/250,000 hits per week. It's a WordPress-based website.

My `my.cnf` is basically empty. I increased the `max_connections` to deal with the initial problem (website keeps hitting ""Database max connections"" errors as per post linked earlier) and that's it.

I've tried to run two scripts on the server to determine how I can optimise my settings. One of them didn't work, but the other suggested the following:

 - Query cache is supported but not enabled; Perhaps you should set the `query_cache_size`
 - You have had 11025 queries where a join could not use an index properly; You should enable ""log-queries-not-using-indexes"" then look for non indexed joins in the slow query log.
 - You have a total of **834 tables**; You have **528 open tables**; Current **table_cache hit rate is 8%**, while **132% of your table cache is in use**; You should probably increase your `table_cache`
 - You should probably increase your `table_definition_cache` value.
 - Current **Lock Wait ratio = 1 : 529**; You may benefit from selective use of InnoDB.
 - Current **max_heap_table_size = 16 M**; Current **tmp_table_size = 16 M**; Of **107071 temp tables, 25% were created on disk**; Perhaps you should increase your tmp_table_size and/or max_heap_table_size to reduce the number of disk-based temporary tables
 - You have **1290** out of **1145245** that take longer than 2.000000 sec. to complete
 - Current max_connections = 500; Current threads_connected = 501; You should raise max_connections

the problem is that I waste a lot of disk space to store unwanted data.

       +-----------+----------+

Now if I pass child_id parameters 11 and 12, I have to get parent_id 2 back, but if I pass 10 and 11, I have to get nothing back. Also, if I pass 11, I have to receive nothing. And if I pass 13, I have to receive 3 back.

How do I go about this? I tried counting the parent_id's and using HAVING clause, also using GROUP BY clause, but nothing I try meets all of my requirements.

This is the php file that displays the highscore: 

    <table border=""0"" width=""100%""><?php echo highscore()?>

This is the php that handles the mysql query (highscore function):

    echo '<tr>';

The mysql query that I have results in the user with the highest score getting on top of the table that you see above.

I don't know how to do this:

1) Application table, has a field named AVARAGE SCORE. So basically this field should contain a value that is the average of all the scores given to this app, so basically i should take all the rows from the feedback table related to the same app.........
ex( app 1, user 2, score 4)
  ( app 1, user 3, score 1)
  ( app 1, user 4, score 2)
  ( app 1, user 1, score 5)

and calculate scores sum (4+1+2+5)\number of raws(4) = 3, and put this value in the app field. But how can i say to mysql to calculate AVARAGE SCORE field value in that way. It's  something that i would like to be done once a day for example, and not every second.......for example at the end of each day mysql calcuate it again and refresh the value.......

2)Applications table has the above avarage scores based on user feedback, and other fields that are important to me like total download numbers, downloads in the last week, how many time users have been looking at the app details and so on........I would like to give a weight  to each of these fields........and generate an overall score..............so that  when an user ask for a 20 apps list.....mysql return a list based (ordered) on this value....

A table is divided into 2 tables. These two tables are linked and the only way to link them is using a varchar name field in the original table. 

Problem is that customer *could* have duplicate names, since name is not the Primary/Unique Key. 

I came here looking for ideas to make these names unique so it can be used as a key when moving the data to the two new linked tables. 

As I'm writing this, I had the idea of CONCATing the current PK to name (as in CONCAT(name,id) as newName) and use this as key. 

There's also a unique code field, but this only goes into one of the new tables. 

Example Schema: 

    tableA
    a_id INT(11) PRI AUTO_INCREMENT
    code VARCHAR(10) UNIQUE 
    name VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL
    
    newTableB
    b_id INT(11) PRI AUTO_INCREMENT
    name VARCHAR(30)
    
    newTableC
    c_id INT(11) PRI AUTO_INCREMENT
    b_id INT(11) FK->newTableB
    code VARCHAR(10) UNIQUE 

What I want: 

 1. Generate New b_id's (auto_increment)  
 2. newTableB.name imported from tableA.name 
 3. newTableC.code imported from tableA.code 
 4. newTableC.c_id imported from tableA.a_id

a_id is an FK in another fourth table that's staying the same. After the changes above, c_id will now be valid FK in this fourth table. 

**My Challenge:** 
How Do insert into these new tables but still keep the original name<->code<->a_id relationship and transfer tableA.a_id values to newTableC.c_id. Don't care if b_id gets new auto_incr. values. 

Not sure how clear I'm making problem come across, but feel free to ask any questions.

So, I'm developing a website locally (PHP + MySQL) and I would like to be able to synchronise at least the structure (and maybe the contents) of the two DB when one of the two is changed (normally I would change the local copy).

Right now what I'm doing is to use `mysqldump` to dump the modified tables and then import them in the remote DB or do it by hand if the changes are minimal. However I find this tedious and error-prone.

For the PHP I'm currently using Quanta+ which has the handy feature of finding files that have changed and just upload those. Is there something similar for MySQL?

Otherwise how do you keep your DBs synchronised?

I have a search box in which user can search either for a post, username or e-mail.

Can I get the results from both tables with one query? Not sure how that will benefit me (if at all), just asking.

Then I should display the results on same page, but posts first, and after the users. As you can see, posts will have different data to display and users will display different data.

I know that group by clausule exist, so I would like to group the results,first to get posts and then users.


Any help with building this query will be deeply appreciated.

This table has all the data, as I've tested by various SELECT statements and via Workbench

In settings.py, I configured my project to connect with that database, successfuly.
Then, I gave the command

    python manage.py inspectdb > studentinfo/models.py

And the contents of models.py became:

    from django.db import models
        class StudentInfo(models.Model):
            pic_id = models.IntegerField(null=True, blank=True)
            name = models.CharField(max_length=150, blank=True)
            room = models.IntegerField(null=True, blank=True)
            branch = models.CharField(max_length=12, blank=True)
            id_no = models.CharField(max_length=36, blank=True)
            class Meta:
                db_table = u'student_info'

Then, if I execute this after syncdb: 


    python manage.py sqlall studentinfo
        BEGIN;
        CREATE TABLE `student_info` (
            `id` integer AUTO_INCREMENT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,

            room = models.IntegerField(null=True, blank=True)
            branch = models.CharField(max_length=12, blank=True)

            class Meta:
                db_table = u'student_info'

Then, if I execute this after syncdb: 


    python manage.py sqlall studentinfo
        BEGIN;
        CREATE TABLE `student_info` (
            `id` integer AUTO_INCREMENT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
            `pic_id` integer,
            `name` varchar(150) NOT NULL,
            `hostel` varchar(9) NOT NULL,
            `room` integer,
            `branch` varchar(12) NOT NULL,
            `id_no` varchar(36) NOT NULL
        )
        ;
        COMMIT;

    (select id as previous from events where date < '{$result['date']}' order by date desc limit 1)
    union all
    (select id as next from events where date > '{$result['date']}' order by date asc limit 1)

it selects the ID where the date is `$result['date]`, the date below that, and the date above that.

So in my php code i need an array like so:

    Array
    (
        [0] => Array
        (
            [current] => 6
        )

        [1] => Array
        (
            [previous] => 5
        )

        [2] => Array
        (
            [next] => 7
        )

    )

however, the array comes out like:

    Array
    (
        [0] => Array
        (
            [current] => 6
        )

        [1] => Array
        (
            [current] => 5
        )

        [2] => Array
        (
            [current] => 7
        )

    )

I need the assoc array to depict the right keys!

Even though in my SQL i do 

`select id as current`
`select id as previous`
`select id as next`

they all come out as `current`???

any ideas?",3

I have 3 tables, main, types and linked.
main has an id column and 32 type columns.
types has id, type
linked has id, main_id, type_id

I want to create an insert before trigger on the main table.
It needs to compare its 32 type columns to the values in the types table if the main table column has an 'X' for its value and insert the main_id and types_id into the linked table.

i have done a lot of searching, and it looks like a prepared statement would be the way to go, but i wanted to ask the experts.

The issue, is i dont want to write 32 IF statements, and even if i did, i need to query the types table to get the ID for that type, seems like a huge waist of resources.

Ideally i want to do this inside of my trigger:

    BEGIN
    
    DECLARE @types results_set -- (not sure if this is a valid type);
    -- (iam sure my loop syntax is all wrong here)...
    SET @types = (select * from types)
    for i=0;i<types.records;i++ {

       END IF;
    }

Anyway, This is what i was hoping to do, maybe there is a way to dynamically set the field name inside of a results loop, but i cant find a good example of this.

Coming from a Microsoft SQL Server background, a (named) instance is a completely separate and isolated installation of the server, running in its own process and on its own port.  However, in MySQL a (server) instance seems to be a different beast, as for starters it seems to use the same port as my ""existing"" ""instance"".

From the Home page of MySQL Workbench, I have the option on the right hand side to create a New Server Instance.  What is a MySQL Server Instance, and why would I ever want to create a new one?",2

Probably this binary might not be pr compiled with that at that time.

Now I would like to enable SSL replication between my master and server.
How can i do this.

    Do I need to proceed with fresh binary installation which has SSL support..
    OR
    Do we have any work around to enable SSL to my existing installation.

    WHERE acs.statusId != 3 
    AND acs.accountId = a.id
    AND a.id = am.accountId 
    AND am.k = 'remindEmail';
    
    -- #2: Have sent email reminder depend on the period --
    -- (30 days => 7, 15 days => 3, 7 days => 1) before 1 year --
    -- and status = 3 --
    SELECT am.accountId, a.email, am.k, am.v, acs.time
    FROM accounts a 
    INNER JOIN account_status  acs ON a.id = acs.accountId 
    INNER JOIN account_metadata am ON a.id = am.accountId
    WHERE acs.statusId = 3
    AND am.k =  'remindEmail'
    AND NOW() <= DATE_ADD(acs.time, INTERVAL 365 DAY)
    AND NOW() >  DATE_ADD(acs.time, INTERVAL 365 - ((am.v & 1) * 7 + (am.v & 2) * 8 + (am.v & 4) * 15) DAY)
    AND am.v = %s;
    
    -- #3: Update account_metadata.v to new status --
    UPDATE `account_metadata` AS am
    SET am.v = '%s'
    WHERE am.accountId = '%s'
    AND am.k = 'remindEmail';
    
 The problem here is, account_status.accountId is not unique (see the table above where accountId = 13; my colleague said it's due to historic reason). This will cause #1 reset some rows back to 7 and the customers feel they got spammed. Is it any way to modified #2 to pick the latest account_status.statusId (based on account_status.time)?

 Note that:
 1. accounts.id, account_metadata.accountId are unique
 2. accounts.id = account_metadata.accountId = account_status.accountId
 
 The MySQL query I currently have is:
 
    -- #1: If statusId in account_status is not 3, then set value of remindEmail to 7 --
    UPDATE `account_status` AS acs, `accounts` AS a, `account_metadata` AS am
    SET am.v = '7' 
    WHERE acs.statusId != 3 
    AND acs.accountId = a.id
    AND a.id = am.accountId 
    AND am.k = 'remindEmail';
    
    -- #2: Have sent email reminder depend on the period --
    -- (30 days => 7, 15 days => 3, 7 days => 1) before 1 year --
    -- and status = 3 --
    SELECT am.accountId, a.email, am.k, am.v, acs.time
    FROM accounts a 
    INNER JOIN account_status  acs ON a.id = acs.accountId 
    INNER JOIN account_metadata am ON a.id = am.accountId
    WHERE acs.statusId = 3
    AND am.k =  'remindEmail'
    AND NOW() <= DATE_ADD(acs.time, INTERVAL 365 DAY)
    AND NOW() >  DATE_ADD(acs.time, INTERVAL 365 - ((am.v & 1) * 7 + (am.v & 2) * 8 + (am.v & 4) * 15) DAY)
    AND am.v = %s;
    
    -- #3: Update account_metadata.v to new status --
    UPDATE `account_metadata` AS am
    SET am.v = '%s'
    WHERE am.accountId = '%s'
    AND am.k = 'remindEmail';
    
 The problem here is, account_status.accountId is not unique (see the table above where accountId = 13; my colleague said it's due to historic reason). This will cause #1 reset some rows back to 7 and the customers feel they got spammed. Is it any way to modified #2 to pick the latest account_status.statusId (based on account_status.time)?

The animal table holds all the relevant data about each animal, as well as an OwnerID column, referencing the ID column of the owner table.
The owner table is similar, and holds a RegionID column (as part of each owner's address), referencing the ID column of the region table.

A little bit about the problem:

 -  I need to insert a large number of rows into an InnoDB tables. 
 - Each table has only one index (which is also the primary key)
 - Each row has about 1KB of data in it.
 - I am using Load Data INFILE queries of about 5000 rows at a time.
 - I am using 8 threads for the writes (each writing separate data ).

Ok, so with these characteristics, I am getting a throughput of around 1 million rows per hour written to the DB. This is about 1 GB of data or ~5KB/sec, based on the upper-end of how much data is in a row. 

However, when I look at my machine statistics, I notice the I/O graph for disk writes flatlines at about 20 MB / sec, which suggest that I am I/O bound. (The CPU graph also shoots to 100%, but about 90% of that is iowait). So, my question is why would MySQL be writing about 20 MB / sec of data to disk, when the amount of data sent through queries is about 5 KB / sec. 

I am guessing the discrepancy is due to log files, temp tables and transaction doubling - but I am wondering why this ratio is more than 100:1? And how can shrink this ratio to something more reasonable? What sort of internal variables are causing MYSQL to write out so much data to disk instead of storing it in memory? For instance, I have already set innodb_buffer_pool_size = 12G, max_heap_table_size = 8G and tmp_table_size = 6G in an attempt to make MySQL use more memory instead of disk - but still the same result.

I appreciate any help and advice you can give me!",mysql,sql,database,optimization,scalability,12/06/2011 03:12:32,off topic,1,319,12,"Why am I I/O bound for writing to MySQL when writing 5KB/sec? I am looking for some help with someone with MySQL expertise. I don't need an exact solution - just some ideas and places to look for optimizing.

A little bit about the problem:

 -  I need to insert a large number of rows into an InnoDB tables. 
 - Each table has only one index (which is also the primary key)
 - Each row has about 1KB of data in it.
 - I am using Load Data INFILE queries of about 5000 rows at a time.
 - I am using 8 threads for the writes (each writing separate data ).

Ok, so with these characteristics, I am getting a throughput of around 1 million rows per hour written to the DB. This is about 1 GB of data or ~5KB/sec, based on the upper-end of how much data is in a row. 

However, when I look at my machine statistics, I notice the I/O graph for disk writes flatlines at about 20 MB / sec, which suggest that I am I/O bound. (The CPU graph also shoots to 100%, but about 90% of that is iowait). So, my question is why would MySQL be writing about 20 MB / sec of data to disk, when the amount of data sent through queries is about 5 KB / sec.

To start off, my site actually consists of widgets. For each widget I need a table for `settings` (where each instance of the widget has its user defined settings), a table for `common` (shared items between instances of the same widget) and `userdata` (users' saved data within an instance of a widget).

Until now, I had the following schema, consisting of 2 databases:

- the first database, where I had all site-maintenance tables (e.g. users, widgets installed, logs, notifications, messages etc.) PLUS a table where I joined each widget instance to each user that instanciated it, having assigned a unique ID (so, I have the following columns: `user_id`, `widget_id` and `unique_id`).
- the second database, where I kept all widget-related data. That means, for each widget (unique by its `widget_id`) I had three tables: `[widget_id]_settings`, `[widget_id]_common` and `[widget_id]_userdata`. In each of these tables, each row held that `unique_id` of the users' widget. Actually here was all the users' data stored within a widget.

To give a short example of how my databases worked:

First database:

- In the `users` table I have `user_id = 1`
- In the `widgets` table I have `widget_id = 1`
- In the `users_widgets` table I have `user_id = 1, widget_id = 1, unique_id = 1`

Second database:

- In the `1_settings` I have `unique_id = 1, ...`, where ... represents the user's widget settings
- In the `1_common` I have several rows which represent shared data between instances of the same widget (so, no user specific data here)
- In the `1_userdata` I have `unique_id = 1, ...`, where ... represents the user's widget data. An important notice here is that this table may contain several rows with the same `unique_id` (e.g. For a tasks widget, a user can have several tasks for a widget instance)

Hope you understood in the rough my database schema.

Now, I want to develop a 'cleaner' schema, so it won't be necessary to have 2 databases and switch each time from one to another in my application. It would be also great if I found a way NOT to dinamically generate tables in the second database (1_settings, 2_settings, ... , n_settings).

I will greatly appreciate any effort in suggesting any better way of achieving this. Thank you very much in advance!

Every column is indexed.
Any MySQL expert can tell how can it be improved by looking at the explain?

The multiple ORDER BY is killing the performance.

I have a table with products and each product has volume. I store the volume in a VARCHAR field and it's usually a number (30, 40, 200..) but there are products that have multiple volumes and their data is stored separated by semicolons, like so 30;60;80.

I know that storing multiple volumes like that is not recommended but I have to work with it like it is.

I'm trying to implement a search by volume function for the products. I want to also display the products that have a bigger or equal volume than the one searched. 
This is not a problem with the products that have a single volume, but it is a problem with the multiple volume products.

Maybe an example will make things clearer: Let's say I have a product with this in it's volume field: 30;40;70;80. 
If someone searched for a volume, lets say 50, I want that product to be displayed.

To do this I was thinking of writing my own custom MySQL function (I've never this before) but maybe someone can offer a different solution.

So here is my question:

**What database would you suggest for a startup that might possibly grow very fast?**

To be more specific:

 - We are using JSON to interchange data with mobile clients, so the data should be stored ideally in this format
 - The data model is relatively simple, like users, categories, history of
   actions... 
 - The users interact in ""real time"" (5 second propagation delay is still OK)
 - The queries are known beforehand (can cache results or use mapreduce)
 - The system would have up to 10000 concurrent users (just guessing...)
 - Transactions are a plus but can live without them I think
 - Spatially enabled is a plus
 - The data replication between nodes should be easy to administer
 - Open source
 - Hosting services available (we'd like to outsource the sysadmin part)

We have now a functional private prototype with a standard relational PostgreSQL/PostGIS. But scalability apart questions, I have to convert relational data to JSON and vice versa which seems like an overhead in high load.

I did a little research but I lack experience with all the new NoSQL stuff. <br/>
So far, I think of these solutions: 

 - Couchbase: master-master replication, native JSON document store, spatial extension, couchapps and although I don't know iriscouch hosting they seem good techs.<br/>
The downside I see so far is javascript debugging, disk occupation. 
 - MongoDb: has only one master but safe failover. Uses binary JSON.
 - Cluster MySQL: the evergreen of web (one master I think)
 - PostgresSQL&Slony: because I just love Postgres:-)

But there are plenty of others, Cassandra, Membase...
Do you guys have some real life experience? The bad one counts too! <br/>
Thanks in advance,

    Entity_Type_Code


However, when i do an explain on the query, it shows me that it uses the primary index (NPI). Also, it says rows examined = 1

What's worse is : the query takes roughly **120** seconds to execute. How do i optimize this ?

I would really appreciate some help regarding this.",3

They all have identical mysql versions installed and are both running the same vb.net server program im working on.

When doing queries with this program my laptop and one of my pc's can do say 1 query in like .0001 secs or something. My other PC (which has the newest and best hardware) is taking over 15 seconds to do one query. This PC is the computer im looking to do my work on and im hoping to get it working properly. Also running say a 10000 insert query takes like .5 secs on my other machines, this takes over 10 mins on the PC in question.

Now at first i had assumed it was a software issue, so i freshly reformatted both of my pc's with the same OS and re-installed just the software i need for this (mysql, Vs 2008) and then tried the querying again. Same result, so it doesnt appear to be a software issue. I tried switching the ram in the PC that isnt working properly and that didnt help either.

I guess i can assume this is a hardware issue, however this PC isnt showing any signs of faulty hardware everything works great and much faster then both of my other machines(except for apparently mysql queries). So i guess im asking if anyone has heard of this kind of issue or what ways i can track down the problem.

I did do a hard drive test and it came up fine, im currently using 4gb of corsair 1066mhz ram, the processor is a Quad AMd phenom II @ 3.4ghz, computer seems to run everything great but the processor has never seemed to live up to it potential so does anyone have any experience running a mysql server on this processor type? as an added note i think the processor might be in cool n quiet mode, possibly ill look into it.

Any help here would great thank you very much.

PHP: 5.3.0
Apache: 2.2.21 (Win32)
PHPMyAdmin: 3.4.9 
MySQL: 5.5

I went through the basic guide of setting up PHP, but it still seems to not work at all.  I have turned on short tags so that's fixed, but I am a newbie at Apache so I may have missed something.  My code works fine on a remote server on the web host I have, but not on my local Apache.  I think it has to do with my header.php which is linked from the index.php file and is linked to the header.php.html file.  This is the header.php.html file where I think the problem lies.   If you don't have an answer, then please say some rules to follow to make sure Apache can read my files.

",mysql,html,apache,php5,localhost,,open,0,632,11,"Same PHP Code On Remote Website Not Working In Local Apache I am setting up Apache with PHP, PHPMyAdmin, and MySQL.  I have
PHP: 5.3.0
Apache: 2.2.21 (Win32)
PHPMyAdmin: 3.4.9 
MySQL: 5.5

I went through the basic guide of setting up PHP, but it still seems to not work at all.  I have turned on short tags so that's fixed, but I am a newbie at Apache so I may have missed something.  My code works fine on a remote server on the web host I have, but not on my local Apache.  I think it has to do with my header.php which is linked from the index.php file and is linked to the header.php.html file.  This is the header.php.html file where I think the problem lies.   If you don't have an answer, then please say some rules to follow to make sure Apache can read my files.

I'm currently trying to get started on development of a project to make my own life a little easier. Essentially, i want to connect to a `MySQL` database running on a remote server, and then go from there with a few various options for usage. The database in question is used for a `Joomla!` installation, and my focus will primarily be managing articles from a desktop application (as opposed to using the administrator backend on the website).

I've allowed my own host access to the remote servers (via the `CPanel` web interface used by my hosting provider), and ensured that `LIBMYSQL.dll` is inside the `RAD Studio\9.0\bin` folder and again inside my executables folder (so as to avoid any of the issues related to being unable to init. the driver). I've connected to the server successfully by using `MySQL Workbench` and can freely query the table. Now, onto the problem.

**This is my first database application so please understand that a simplified or excessive explanation may be needed**

I'm having issues setting some of the component properties at design time. I've got a `TSQLConnection` component, a `TSQLDataSet` component, and a `TSQLTable` component. I've set up the server properties in `TSQLConnection` to work with my server.

However, if i try to retrieve anything from the database inside the `Delphi XE2` IDE (i.e. the login prompt appears) such as changing `Active` property to true, i get a `Can't connect to MySQL server on 'xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx' (10061)` error (where 'x' relates to part of my servers IP).

If i run the application itself though, and then click on the ""connect"" button i've got on the interface, it connects fine with no errors. I added `ShowMessage` routines to the `AfterConnect`, `AfterDisconnect`, and `OnLogin` events of `TSQLConnection` to verify it was actually going through, and all of them functioned as i'd expect when successful. As i've not coded for it to do anything outside of that (due to still learning the basics), there's no data visible on the interface for me to work with, but the connection at least appears to be there.

To clarify, i can connect from the application i developed (as well as from `MySQL Workbench`, but not from within the Delphi IDE itself.

So, where am i going wrong with this?

I'm guessing it's probably some oversight by myself due to my lack of knowledge on the subject of databases, but i'm very keen to expand out of the desktop environment and start working with some more areas of the IT world (without losing the development side of things that i enjoy so much).",mysql,database,delphi-xe2,firemonkey,dbexpress,,open,0,425,6,"SQL Component Connection issue in IDE Good evening guys.

Recently, I've been given some projects that require queries and commands a little too complex for a single query into a MySql database, and any answer online that even comes close to what I'm talking about always deals with the issue using a script.

I don't feel the need to list out my exact issue here, because I still want to try to work through it myself, but I'm extremely confused on how you can write and implement a script for both MySql and Microsoft Excel. Currently, I'm on a Macbook Pro using Terminal and MySql Workbench for work in databases, and I edit the few scripts I do write in the Vim editor. When it come to Excel, I'm clueless.

Are both of these situations made possible by writing scripts in my vim editor? If so, what do the extensions need to be and how can I link them to servers that I typically SSH into? The syntax of such scripts makes a little sense to me, but I'd be able to pick up on it a lot faster if I could practice it myself. I just don't even know how to start.

I'd appreciate any help or points in the right direction. If possible, try to explain things as nooby as you can. Act like I'm really new at this please.
