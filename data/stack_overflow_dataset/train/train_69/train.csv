Am I just doing it wrong?,"I'm working on a project that uses two processes that communicate to each other through named pipes.  Each processes uses a different version of a protocol that communicates using a different version of CORBA hence me using named pipes to communicate between the processes.  The processes have to translate from one version of the protocol to the other.  

I'm used to using boost_threads and hooking things together using thread safe queues and function calls that I roll myself.  However,  the signal and slots idiom of Qt seems really helpful for some things but not others.  For example,  for named pipes, it seems great for doing asynchrounous communication that way.  

That is until I have to pass the object I received over the named pipe to be translated and then send it off using the CORBA middleware protocol using the translator thread.  There is also a thread that runs the CORBA middleware which has to continously call a function to generate callbacks for the middleware to receive messages and send out messages.  

The biggest issue I have is sending these messages back and forth through the signals and slots mechanism or perhaps using QMetaObject::invokeMethod().  It seems like this would get sent out using a Queued connection and if I understand correctly it copies the object being passed instead of passing it by reference or pointer.

**Client1->Server** Connects. Request friendlist.

**Server->Client1** Sends the friendlist. The friendlist has 1 friend and that  friend is Offline.

**Client2->Server** Connects. Does same stuff.

**Client1->Server** Does requests after some seconds to see if a friend connected.

**Server->Client1** Answers if a client has connected. If yes sends the updated stuff.

OR:

**Client1->Server** Connects. Request friendlist.

**Server->Client1** Sends the friendlist. The friendlist has 1 friend and that  friend is Offline.

**Client2->Server** Connects. Does same stuff.

**Server->Client2** Same stuff.

**Server->Client1** Tell the client that a friend has connected.

There is a slot (in some other object) connected to its finished() signal. Signals are synchronous (the default ones). There is only one thread.

At some moment of time I want to get rid of both of the objects. No more signals or anything from them. I want them gone.
Well, I thought, I'll use

`delete obj1; delete obj2;`

But can I really?
The specs for ~QObject say:

> Deleting a QObject while pending events are waiting to be delivered can cause a crash.

Whooa! What are the 'pending events'?
Could that mean that while I'm calling my `delete`, there are already some 'pending events' to be delivered and that they may cause a crash and I cannot really check if there are any?

So let's say I call:

`obj1->deleteLater(); obj2->deleteLater();`

to be safe.

But - am I really safe? The `deleteLater` adds an event that will be handled in the main loop when control gets there. Can there be some pending events (signals) for `obj1` or `obj2` already there, waiting to be handled in the main loop *before* deleteLater will be handled? That would be very unfortunate. I don't want to write code checking for 'somewhat deleted' status and ignoring the incoming signal in all of my slots.

I'm puzzled. Please help.

For this application we are willing to sacrifice support for Windows 2000, Macs, and Linux.  But, the issue is more related to Microsoft's commitment to the framework and their extant platforms.  It seems like Microsoft has a bad habit of coming up with something new, hyping it for a few years, and then relegating it to the waste-bin essentially abandoning the developers who chose it.  First it was MFC and VB6, then Windows Forms, and now there's WPF.  Also with .NET, versions of Windows were progressively nicked off the support list.  Looks like WPF could be here to stay for a while, but since its not open source its really in Microsoft's hands.  I'm also concerned about the overhead and performance of WPF since some of our applications involve processing large amounts of information and doing real-time data capture.  Qt seems like a really good option, but it doesn't have all the features of WPF/.NET couldn't use languages like C#.

First it was MFC and VB6, then Windows Forms, and now there's WPF.  Also with .NET, versions of Windows were progressively nicked off the support list.  Looks like WPF could be here to stay for a while, but since its not open source its really in Microsoft's hands.  I'm also concerned about the overhead and performance of WPF since some of our applications involve processing large amounts of information and doing real-time data capture.  Qt seems like a really good option, but it doesn't have all the features of WPF/.NET couldn't use languages like C#.

Basically, what does the community think about Microsoft's commitment to WPF compared with previous frameworks?  Are the performance considerations significant enough to avoid using it for a realtime app?  And, how significant are the benefits of WPF/.NET in terms of productivity and features compared to Qt?",5

------

I will attempt to explain a problem I am having – its a really weird one so bear with me as I try to explain it.

Let me outline my application first. It is a simple ‘Serial Data Logger’ type program written in Qt 4.7 on Windows XP; it basically receives communications on a serial port (using QExtSerialPort), does some processing to extract data from these communications and then pushes this data to a front end GUI as well as outputting it to Log Files. I also have the comms and data coming to the Application Output at various points using qDebug() so I can monitor what is flowing around inside the application.

For clarity, in case you haven’t used it, QExtSerialPort simply emits a signal when there are bytes received at the serial port and passes these to a connected slot using QByteArray.

So now to my problem – my application initially runs perfectly but after about 5 – 10 mins the whole thing locks up and stops working, forcing me to crash it.

Having investigated this further in the debugger, I have noticed a very strange thing.

The stream of communications is fairly constant so by monitoring the ‘application output’ pane in the debugger, I am able to straight away see when the program locks as no more communications seem to arrive. If at this point, I click and drag the window of my application to another part of the screen, communications begin to come in and be processed and then it stops and locks up again, until I move the window again and then it will allow more data in and so on and so on….. I have tried this for a while and each time I move the window on the screen it allows the program to receive communications and process. If I open the top left system menu of the window (using ALT-space) this also seems to allow communications to be processed for as long as it is open.

So my limited deductions here seem to direct me to the theory that as each of these actions blocks the re-painting of the window, then the GUI/Re-painting action must be blocking my communications from coming in.

Also – the data is pushed to the GUI using two slots and what’s even more interesting (I think) is that if I remove the connection to these slots, thus allowing no interaction with the GUI class within my code, the application runs fine and never locks up with all data making it to the Log File and the Application Output. However these slots are very simple and only check the state of some combo-boxes to decide whether to update some text fields.

Has anyone ever seen anything like this before? Anyone have any ideas as to what might be going on?

I use Windows as a primary OS but there are alot of Mac users .Linux too . and these days Tablets have taken alot of developing space ( Android and stuff ) .

So what option do you advice :

1)Write the program from the scratch on each OS , i mean writing the program on Windows using Viusal Studio , on Mac use Xcode .
but this costs alot ... i own Windows PC  , buying Mac or Mac OS for my desktop, will ruin my budget .

  Qt is nice . but how about the commercial use ? i have read that i need to buy commercial licence inorder to publish my apps worldwide .
please if this is wrong tell me about it .

Finally I cannot do a correct solution for a common problem. Need your help.

I want to have a QGrapchics framework view & edit capabilities for manage big vectorial worlds. I'm testing my program against a world with 100000 item entities.
Ok. The feed of system is fast and also its initial visualization.
The problem was when I want to take control over the paint event. (in example to know when the draw is done)
If I use a paintevent, I have to recall QgraphicsView::paint(). No problem. 

The big problem I have is when I want to create a dynamic new element (havin the other 100000 items). In example , a new line. To create this line I do the first click and then, when moving the mouse, as expected, I want to view the line. No problem with this. The problem is that I have a repaint for every item intercepted. In case of drawing a new rectangle the problem grows.

To avoid this, I have tried this trick. 
I create a temporal item, not added to the scene. On mouse_move_event  I throws an invalidate event for the foreground layer, in which I'm going to draw this temporal item. I expected that exist some 'auto' buffer strategy at itemslayer, but not.  I see how I have a paintevent. Ok, to avoid this, I create a pixmap at the begin of my edit process, copying the screen , later at the paintevent, where I know if I'm editing, I make a pixmap copy to later draw the temporal line at drawforeground event. (subclased).  I have passing a rect for the whole scene ( I pass full scene rect because if no by any reason, foreground painting is strange) (I know that a right rect, restricted only to the area needed, would be better, but...)

The big problem: I have to 'recall' Graphicsview::paint, because if not the drawforeground is not throwed. But doing this means that the QGraphicscene order a repaint for the items...

The new node will be placed at the 11th position (10th counting from 0).

Is this logic correct ?

Thanks for help.


----------

I'm wondering also about using beginRemoveRows.

Is this correct:

    beginRemoveRows(parentIndex, currentRow, currentRow);
    // delete record
    endRemoveRows();

currentRow contains position in the list counting from 0.

http://doc.qt.nokia.com/latest/qurlinfo.html#setLastModified

**For example:**

I'd like to use its method named QUrlInfo::setLastModified so that I can set the lastModified timestamp for a local file. (also on a shared netw file but right now I just want to focus on a local file).

Let's say that the local file is ""D:/dir1/dir2/file.txt"".

How can I use QUrlInfo when I only have fullFileName (""D:/dir1/dir2/file.txt"") to use its GET and SET methods?  In particular I'd like an example of how I can create a QUrlInfo object and use its QUrlInfo::setLastModified method.  

**Deeper explanation:**

My main source of confusion comes from the fact that its constructor look like the 
following

   

    //Version 1: Problem is you must already have a QUrlInfo object.
    QUrlInfo ( const QUrlInfo & ui )
    
    //Version2: Problem is you must already know everything about the file.
    //This makes QUrlInfo objects large set of GET methods useless for the most part
    //since you must already know all the GET info before making a QUrlInfo object.

I've written a number of similar applications in Qt.  With Qt, I'd create a QCanvas and a QCanvasView.  I can then add objects to, or remove objects from, the QCanvas and call the `update()` method on the QCanvasView to see the changes take effect without flicker.

This didn't work: I got a rather unhelpful `ArgumentException: Parameter is not valid` exception, which I can only assume was thrown by Windows because it wasn't expecting the app to do any painting at that point.

I'm building a Qt app that uses slidingStackedWidgets in order to slide from one page to another one.

I have 2 toolBars, a topToolBar and a bottomToolBar that do not slide when the central widget moves.

So I have declared a QAction in my mainWindow.h

     QAction *backToMainVert;

And in my mainWindow.cpp, when I call the second view by clicking a button, I call a slideInAdd() method that goes like this:

    
    slidingStacked->slideInIdx(1); //this takes me back to my second page
    backToMainVert = this->topToolBar->addWidget(backBarButton); 
    //this adds a backButton to the topToolBar
Now the backBarButton is connected to a slideToMain() method which, when triggered takes me back to my first page and removes the backBarButton from the topToolBar

        this->topToolBar->removeAction(backToMainVert);

The problem is that the first time I switch to the second page, my button is created and displayed on my topToolBar, when I click the backBarButton, it goes back to the first page but the second time I want to go to the second page, the backBarButton never appears.

I have two different versions of a widget, one is view-only (the data is displayed in QLabels) and the other is used to edit the data (the data is displayed in appropriate editors).

The latter one works perfectly with the delegate, everything is fine.

As you may have guessed the problem arises with the first one... When mapping the sections of my model to QLabels using the QDataWidgetMapper, the delegate is never called and the data is displayed correctly for the sections with regular data (strings, ints,...) but no data is displayed for the sections of my model with a custom data type (a kind of list) which I would like to format as a string using the delegate.

I've already performed this operation successfully when the same data is displayed in a QTableView (the method paint() of the delegate is called when the data is displayed).

After having looked at it a little bit closer, I've been able to see that, when using QLabels to display the data, the delegate is never called though I've explicitly associated a delegate to the QDataWidgetMapper using its method setItemDelegate().

So in synthesis, assume a class CustomItemDelegate which inherits QStyledItemDelegate with virtual methods:

    void CustomItemDelegate::paint(QPainter *painter, const QStyleOptionViewItem &option, const QModelIndex &index) const {
        qDebug() << ""DELEGATE: PAINT"" << index.column();
        QStyledItemDelegate::paint(painter, option, index);
    }
    
    void CustomItemDelegate::setEditorData(QWidget *editor, const QModelIndex &index) const {
        qDebug() << ""DELEGATE: SET EDITOR DATA"" << index.column();
        QStyledItemDelegate::setEditorData(editor, index);
    }

and a widget with following in it:

    QDataWidgetMapper* mapper = new QDataWidgetMapper();
    CustomItemDelegate* delegate = new CustomItemDelegate();
    mapper->setModel(model);
    mapper->setItemDelegate(delegate);

    mapper->addMapping(editorWidget, 1);
    mapper->addMapping(label, 2, ""text"");

    mapper->toFirst();

    QTableView* view = new QTableView();
    CustomItemDelegate* delegate2 = new CustomItemDelegate();
    view->setModel(model);
    view->setItemDelegate(delegate2);

the code outputs:

    DELEGATE: SET EDITOR DATA 1
    // NOTHING ?!

    DELEGATE: PAINT 1
    DELEGATE: PAINT 2

and as a result I got 

 - my editorWidget with the correct data in it (whatever data type the section contains: regular or custom, as long as the editor handles the type of course), 
 - my label only displays the data if the section contains a regular type of the data as the delegate is not called
 - my view would display everything fine as the delegate is called for each section

So my questions are:

 - why isn't the delegate called when the mapped widget is a QLabel?
 - how is the data even displayed when the data type is regular? Magic?

Thanks very much and I apologize in advance if the answer is obvious (but even then, thank you for pointing it out :P),

Fact is: I would like to create an application possible to be called from command line, AND using a GUI. So it would be useful for cmd fans, and GUI users as well.

It would be interesting to create a web interface as well in the future, so it could be run in a server somewhere in a interface.

So, I'm thinking about two options:
 - Creating a ""model"" with a simple interface which is called from a desktop/web implementation;
 - Creating a ""model"" with an html interface, and embeb a browser component in the software, so I could reuse all the code in both desktop/web scenarios.

My question is: which exactly concepts are involved in this project? What advantages/disadvantages each approach has? Are they possible?

By naming ""interface"", I'm planning to just do some interfaces.py files with def calls. Is this a bad approach?

I would like to know some book recommendations, or resources to both options - or source code from projects which share the same GUI/cmd/web goals I'm after.
