I want to create a new worksheet by copying another. This places the new sheet before the sheet being copied. I then want to move it to the very end of all of the sheets.

    }

It works for the first sheet, it renames the sheet then moves it to the end but after that everytime it reaches the .Move method it doesn't do anything except .Activate() the original ""Summary"" sheet.

I ran this code when each description belonged to furniture category . When I run it the values of all the variables remain 0 . When I opened the debugger and viewed the values of variables  
it showed the values of variable in line

to be 0,0 and 1750 respectively . I cannot understand why it does not add two double values .Is this related to the lifetime of variable ? if yes can you tell me something so that i can get out of this problem",5

Here is my code basically when you run it asks for input of xml files then you select some and it generates the values of the xpaths from the first sheet. See screenshot above for before it is run and screenhot at the bottom for after it is run.

It works fine when I select just a few xmls as input at the file dialog but sometimes if I select many files (such as over 1000) it spawns a 'Type mismatch error' and the Results sheet remains blank. This error seems to be intermittent and not related to the data, not sure if having other spreadsheets at the same time could cause it. I'm raking over the code but have no idea what is causing the error. Note, i'm already using Option Explicit.
