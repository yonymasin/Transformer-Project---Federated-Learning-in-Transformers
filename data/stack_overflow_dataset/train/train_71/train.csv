Thanks for taking the time to read my post, I have a dated CS degree so I understand the basic of VB but I don't write macros very often and need help solving a particular condition. (...but I understand functions and object oriented programming)

Assume the following:
Column A contains reference ID's in alphanumeric form, sorted alphabetically.
Column B contains strings of text, or blanks.

I'm trying to write a macro that automatically removes any extra rows for each unique reference number based on the contents of the ""Notes"" in column B. The problem is that if column A has multiple instances of a unique ref number, I need to identify which row contains something in column B. There is one catch. It is possible that the reference number has nothing in column B, which is possible, and should be retained. To explain further, in the following screenshot I would need to KEEP THE YELLOW HIGHLIGHED ROWS, and DELETE the remaining rows. I tried to show various configurations of how the report might show the data using the brackets on the right and marked in red. Its difficult to explain what I'm trying to do so I figured a picture would show what I need more clearly.

This works, and I know there are a lot of similar questions here. **But here's where I'm having trouble:** this only works if I set D4 to an explicit value, say `""48""`. I **want** it to work even if D4 is a formula: so if D4 is `""=SUM(A4:C4)""` then an email should send if that sum drops below 100. This code won't send an email in that case :-(

Does anyone know how to fix this?",3

        End With
    Next i

The ranges for some of the series have no data in their cells yet; the user will write/load this data later. The idea is to have the chart ready for when they do. 

**Problem**: when the loop hits such a yet empty range, I get an error 1004: Unable to set XValues property of the Series class. Why and is there a way around this? 

The weird thing is that doing this manually in Chart menu --> |Source Data... works perfectly fine. Actually, if you record a macro while doing this manually, the result is as follows: 

    ActiveChart.SeriesCollection.NewSeries
    ActiveChart.SeriesCollection(4).XValues = ""=Sheet2!R4C31:R32003C31""
    ActiveChart.SeriesCollection(4).Values = ""=Sheet2!R4C32:R32003C32""

but then Excel gives an error when re-playing this macro!

Doing this manually is not a pleasant prospect. I guess I could stick sham data in the cells, create the series, and then delete the sham data. Do I really have to pull such a bait and switch on Excel?",5

I was trying to count duplicate data in excel. I cant find relevant answers, so I just ask here. And thank you for answering in advance.

I am trying to countif - with two columns of information. if the values in
column A = certain criteria, i want to count the number of times a value
appears in Column B (Do not count the same value from column B, only count the different values) - not all values in column A correspond to column b
values. So if I want to see how many females received a ""5"", I need to see
how many ""female"" in column A have a corresponding value of ""5"" in column B.
(not all females have a ""5"", values can be 1 through 5)

The whole workbook is driven by the lead sheet which the user inputs the signal type and where it is located.  On the worksheet that generates the density map I give the user the ability to click a cell of interest in the density map.  when the user clicks the cell a on_selectionChange macro will run computing the location in the plant.  The location is than fed into the lead sheets auto filter to show the user what signals are actually at that spot in the plant.  My problem is that the location information is computed instantly, but when I go to apply the filter criteria to the autofilter it takes 12 seconds for the filter to apply and the code to change from the density map sheet to the lead database sheet.  So does anyone know how I can speed up my code with autofilters.  I do turn off screen updating and application calculations when running the macro.  This has never been this slow until I started adding other sheets to the workbook. Below you can see my code on how I compute the location.  Can someone help me out with this

      2     x        x       x

So in the above tables TABLE2 holds all the data and TABLE1 is basically a sum of the data by week. So I want the SUMIFS to read something like SUMIFS(TABLE2[????], TABLE2[Week], $B$2) But I can't figure out how to get the sum_range part of the SUMIFS to let me pass parameters in. Any tips or ideas on how to do this?

Is there a way to have visually represented user re-sizable data ranges in Excel? (If so, via VSTO?)

**Long version**

I'm writing an add-in to Excel that helps with exporting data within arbitrary workbooks to existing database tables. The data is more or less tabular but it's almost always laid out differently. I'm looking to make the process as error free but quick as possible. For example, columns for ranges of tabular data have their header names ranked for similarity to a pre-determined field names list. The rankings are then fed into a solver for the [assignment problem][1]. This allows columns to be mapped to fields automatically with surprisingly high accuracy.

However, detecting the ranges of tabular data isn't feasible -- often not all of the data is wanted for export. Therefore, I'm looking to make a familiar yet quick to operate user interface for users to specify the tabular data ranges within a workbook.

One such user interface would be to have the user draw and re-size the ranges they'd like to export. Thus, I'm seeking to do exactly that. However, I'm open to other user interface ideas if they're more conducive to implementation yet still easy to use.

I have tried this opening Excel normally and in safe mode (ie with no addins installed). This happens even if I have done nothing but open excel, open the VBE then close excel. 

It seems that I have exactly the same issue doing this in Excel 2010 and Excel XP. I have tried to repair the installation of Office 2010 but that has not made any difference.

Looking in the Systems log (Control Panel, Admin Tools, Event Viewer, Windows Logs, Application) there are a list of various level events. The ones that relate to excel failing to close are an error level and an information level shown below.

",excel,macros,excel-vba,,,,open,0,887,9,"Modifying Excel VB Macro to Open Multiple Word Docs Just for starters, I have limited VBA experience, and I am mostly modifying stuff that I saw posted online.

Like many others, I have attempted to help but the problem is elusive.  I now wonder if I have discovered the cause.

I am working on an application in which I need to extract data from an Excel worksheet and output it as strings formatted to match the value the Excel user can see.  So if the value is “1” formatted to display as “1.00” then I want the string to be “1.00”.

I achieve this effect by testing the cell value to be a number, date or time.  If it is, I retrieve the number format and use it to format the cell value so:

    With .Cells(Row, Column) 
      Output string = Format(.Value, .NumberFormat)
    End With

In most cases this gives me exactly the output I require.  However, sometimes I get American dates and times when the source is formatted as a UK date or time.

After much experimentation with Excel 2003 and Excel 2007, I have discovered the cause.  (I do not have access to Excel 2010 but from questions I deduce it has the same problem.)  This question is in part intended to reveal this problem to the world because I can discover nothing on the internet to indicate that anyone else has noticed it.  (No doubt someone will reply that they googled “xyz” and got the answer immediately.)  However, the main purpose of this question is to seek suggestions for obtaining the result I need in all situations.

Typically I enter dates as, for example, “23mar12”.  Excel recognises this as a date and formats it as “23-Mar-12”.  I can select `Format Cells` and enter or select a custom format or select one of the date formats so I can have any format I can imagine wanting including non-English names for days and months.

However, in one case the format I select is not the format that is recorded: Custom format “dd/mm/yyyy” is recorded as Date format “* 14/03/2001”.  This is not obviously a problem until further down the line.

I created a column of dates and times and formatted each with a different custom or standard format.   I wrote a macro to extract the NumberFormat for each of these dates and times and write it as a string to an adjacent column.  I also formatted the value using the number format and wrote that string to a third column.

In a number of cases the format selected and recorded by Excel was not the format returned by NumberFormat:

    Excel format            NumberFormat
    Date: * 14/03/2001       m/d/yyyy
    Date: * 14 March 2001   [$-F800]dddd, mmmm dd, yyyy
    Date: 14/03/2001        dd/mm/yyyy;@
    Date: 14/03/01          dd/mm/yy;@
    Date: 14/3/01           d/m/yy;@
    Date: 14.3.01           d.m.yy;@
    Date: 2001-03-14        yyyy-mm-dd;@
    Date: 14 March 2001 (1) [$-809]dd mmmm yyyy;@
    Date: 14 March 2001 (2) [$-809]d mmmm yyyy;@
    Custom: hh:mm:ss        h:mm:ss
    Time: * 13:30:55        [$-F400]h:mm:ss AM/PM
    Time: 13:30:55 (1)      hh:mm:ss;@
    Time: 13:30:55 (2)      h:mm:ss;@
    Time: 01:30:55 PM       [$-409]hh:mm:ss AM/PM;@
    Time: 1:30:55 PM        [$-409]h:mm:ss AM/PM;@

The values (1) and (2) in the Excel format column were added by me to indicate that there are two apparently identical formats.  As can be seen from the NumberFormat column, in each case the second version suppresses a leading zero.

Most changes have no important effect.  “[$-F800]” and so on are apparently dummy values with no effect.  Apparently you can replace “F800” with an Microsoft country code to have the names of days and months translated to the language of that country.

However, the three standard formats that Microsoft marks with an asterisk are changed unacceptably.  The dates are changed from little endian to middle endian; the time is changed from 24 hour to 12 hour and the day of the week has been added to “* 14 March 2001”.

The asterisk against the dates, references the comment: “Except for items that have an asterisk (*) in the Type list (Number tab, Format Cells dialog box), date formats that you apply do not switch date orders with the operating system.”  The asterisk against the time, references the comment: “Except for items that have an asterisk (*) in the Type list (Number tab, Format Cells dialog box), time formats that you apply do not switch time orders with the operating system.”

If I have to, I can warn my users that standard date and time formats may not give the result desired.  However, if they want the popular format “dd/mm/yyyy”, they cannot have it.  “dd-mm-yyyy”, for example, is OK but custom format “dd/mm/yyyy” becomes date format “* 14/03/2001” becomes “m/d/yyyy”.

Returning to my opening point: is this strange handling of one particular date format the reason so many people claim their dates are sometimes being converted to American format and is this why the problem is so elusive?  I have come across this type of problem elsewhere of one group of Microsoft programmers not knowing what another group are doing.  Is this why some functions always work and other sometimes don’t?  Some Microsoft programmers know where to look for the correct format and others don’t?

More importantly, for me, can anyone suggest:

  - How I obtain the true date or time format?
  - Some other way of determining the user’s chosen display format for a date or time?

BTW 1: I recall that thirty or so years ago I was told that the American military do not use month/day/year format; only American civilians use this format.  Can anyone tell me if this is true?

BTW 2: The similar problem is with Excel colours.  Excel holds its colours as ""ggbbrr"" while everybody else holds them as ""rrggbb"".  The programmers for the .Net Excel inter-op were not told and and did not reverse the Excel colour number before using it to control the screen.",excel,excel-vba,,,,,open,0,1137,10,".NumberFormat sometimes returns the wrong value with dates and times It seems that every week or so someone posts a question about dates being converted (corrupted?) to American format.

The record for a single loop then would basically consist of the final value recorded for any field within the given timeframe.  I can do this easily for a single step of this, but I have 2600+ row of data to process per data set and half a dozen data sets to process.

Is there a clean/simple/pragmatic way to do this across the entire data file?  I could brute force this any number of ways, but I'm hoping to not have to reinvent the wheel.  If I could write the output to a new worksheet, that'd be great.",1

I have a matrix of data that I'm updating by adding 'n' number of rows based on a unique key (date) from another worksheet. I've already implemented the copying of the key over to the matrix. Now, I want to copy the last used row, which contains formulas, over to the empty rows associated with updated 'n' key(s).

So, my question is, how do I use VBA to determine the number of rows that are empty between what was last used and what I just pasted?

I can brute force it IE I can get the address of the row I just copied data to and separate the letter from the number coordinate. Do the same for the last used row of the data that was last entered, subtract the numbers and get my delta. However, that seems to really be brute forcing that is quite unnecessary.

This sheet, used to collect some data from employees resides in a shared location in network. It has a feature where users are sent reminder mails when they fail to fill data in time.  In the mail content I like to add the local network path to my excel file.

I accomplish this by adding the code

    “You can access the tool from the location "" & ThisWorkbook.FullName

On sending mails using this code I get the path to this folder as C:\Users\XYZ\Hello.xlsm
I would like to send the network path with IP address so that users can directly copy the path into run and access the file.

Interesting thing is that if I send the mail from another system other than mine by accessing the file form my shared folder, the mail is sent with the network path. Can anyone help on this?

A user selects a project number, then can select from a list of tool types both of which pre-exist in the access database. However, if the project does not have that tool associated, I don't want that tool to show up in the listbox. For example, say a user has selected project number 15. There are 3 tools associated with this project, say their names are tool 'A', 'C', 'D'. In other words, tool B has nothing to do with this project.

I have two different database tables that I am looking at. One table has all the tool names and is named ToolNames. The other table has all the tool files that list the project association, it's called ToolFiles. So there can be multiple copies of tool 'C' in the database that just vary with the amount of data in them. 

I really need to query the ToolNames table, based on input from the user which can be checked in the ToolFiles table. Take the project number, look through the ToolFiles database for tools, and then populate record names of the tools with that project number and then query the ToolNames database and only select the ToolNames that showed up in the ToolFiles database. The ToolFiles database can have multiple can have duplicated tool names. 

I know this is a complicated question, and it is difficult to explain. Let me know if there is anything I can clarify.
