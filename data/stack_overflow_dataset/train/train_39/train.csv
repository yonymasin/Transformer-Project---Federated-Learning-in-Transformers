but the_content() doesn't display anything in page A, B or C, only works in index or single.php. The_title() show up in every page though.

I tried to use very basic loop, but to no avail.
here is sample of my custom page:

    <?php /* Template Name: FirstNews */ ?> 

    <?php get_header(); ?>

    <?php if (have_posts()) : while (have_posts()) : the_post(); ?>
	    <?php the_title(); ?>
	    <?php the_content(); ?>
    <?php endwhile; endif; ?>

    <?php get_footer(); ?>

only the_title() displayed. the_excerpt() also not working.

is it possible to have several loops over several pages? or it's restricted to just one page in wordpress?


thx ;)

is the closest I've found yet to the type of problem I'm having.

The home page of my site is not centered.
When you click on any secondary page it will center.

I have Googled at least 100 times for every article on centering
a web page with CSS using several search terms.  I have even
replaced style.css with a freshly downloaded copy of the theme
style.css file with no change.

I fixed one custom template page that was doing the same thing
by adding:

    <?php
    get_template_part( 'loop', 'page' );
    ?>

I tried doing that with the home page but it still did not fix it.
The home page will still not center.

The theme is supposed to be HTML5, I ran it through a validator
and it gives errors for the rel statements, but that should eventually
be fixed when they get the validator updated.  No relevant CSS seems to
be a problem to the validator.

When I do clear: left in #primary of the Layout section,
it fixes the problem, but the right sidebar widget goes down
the page.

I also fixed the duplicate #wrapper entry that comes as a default with the
Twenty Ten theme.

I don't recall having the problem before the Wordpress 3.2.1 update, but
then again I may not have noticed it.

and it gives errors for the rel statements, but that should eventually
be fixed when they get the validator updated.  No relevant CSS seems to
be a problem to the validator.

When I do clear: left in #primary of the Layout section,
it fixes the problem, but the right sidebar widget goes down
the page.

I also fixed the duplicate #wrapper entry that comes as a default with the
Twenty Ten theme.

I don't recall having the problem before the Wordpress 3.2.1 update, but
then again I may not have noticed it.

Lets say for example i have some contact details and i want to include this content on multiple pages. One way i tried was to create a custom post type and just add posts for 

 - Email 
 - Phone 
 - Address

I would then simply read the ID's of those posts and in my template hardcode the ID's into some get_post() calls, to extract the content. 

The problem with this approach is 

 1. im hardcoding ID
 2. lets say my Address needs different input fields like ""Street"" / ""City"" ""Zipcode"". Then i would need to create multiple custom post types, because i cant just add it to the same because it would make no sense for a email to have a zipcode field.


I hope to get some pointers to how i would structure content like this. I guess i could write a custom plugin, but then i would miss out on all those features post's has like a rich text field and gallery support, and the support for adding more fields etc.

This is for a responsive website, so when resizing the browser, the image resizes. The problem is that if I set a height on the parent .mosaic-block-three element, then the image appears to stay fixed at that height.

If I set the .mosaic-block-three element to height: auto, then it fails completely and goes down to 0 height.

What am I missing to make this scale smoothly? I can rearrange css or html as needed. I've tried for hours so any help is GREATLY appreciated :-)

    	echo $currentbids;
    	die();
    	} // end if

One would be to create each form as a theme template file. Those pages would submit data to themselves and all would be great, _except_ the fact that I don't really like my plugin and theme to be so hardly connected. I think that theme should be for design only, which means header, footer, etc... and that plugin should handle all the other work.

Second solution is to make some controller.php file somewhere in my plugin folder and then all requests should be directed to this controller which would control what page should be displayed and how. And each page should be made with the use of WP short codes located inside my plugin folder. Problem with this approach is that I have problems transfer POST parameters, after I submit a form. I would submit a form to my controller which would then redirect it to a page with all POST parameters lost.

Third solution would be to target actuall pages which display content with the use of WP shortcodes, and when user successfully submits the form shortcode would instead of the custom form, return some Thank you message. Problem here lies in fact that if you hit refresh while Thank You message is displayed browsere would submit the form once again. And again and again, every time you'd press refresh.


Simple question. How would you do it? 

Would it be the first way? I see many people doing just that, hardcoding their custom forms inside template files, even though it may be not the cleanest solution. Hmm... Still, I would like to separate my forms and logic away from my theme.

The shortcode needs to take some parameters and create a custom loop with output.

One of the parameters is how many posts to output the loop for ($markers)

    $args=array(
                   	'meta_key'=>'_mykey',
                  	'post_status'=>'publish',
                   	'post_type'=>'post',
    				'orderby'=>'date',
                   	'order'=>'DESC',
    				'posts_per_page'=>$markers,
    
    );
    
      $wp_query = new WP_Query();
               $wp_query->query($args);
    
    if ($wp_query->have_posts()) : while (($wp_query->have_posts()) ) : $wp_query->the_post();

    // do the loop using get_the_id() and $post->id

    endwhile;endif;
    wp_reset_query();//END query

On occations I will need to have data from ALL posts `($markers = '-1' )` and sometimes only one `($markers = '1' )` or muliple `($markers = 'x')`.

All of those work great on single pages / posts - but My problem is that when this function is in a place where I have more than one post (!is_single) and (`$ markers = '1'` )it will always return the data for the LATEST post , and not for the correct one ..
(for example in the default wordpress theme, where it would display10 posts - they will all be the same data )

It is obviously a problem of the `$post->ID` - but how can I have the correct post ID when doing a custom loop OUTSIDE the wp loop ?

I tried to ovverride the problem by 

    global $post;
     $thePostIDtmp = $post->ID; //get the ID before starting new query as temp id
     $wp_query = new WP_Query();
     $wp_query->query($args);
    // Start Custom Loop

    if (!is_single()){
    $post_id_t = $thePostIDtmp;}
    else {
    $post_id_t = $post->ID;}

and then use  `$post_id_t` - but it did not seems to work ,
Should I not use get_the_id() ? or should I not use query (and use get_posts) ??

Any ideas / solutions / thoughts ??

I have an existing Real Estate Site that I intend to move 100% into WordPress. The existing site has one backend for listings and another blog section for reviews.

You can probably see why I have decided to make the move to a full WordPress powered site. Maintaining both ends of the site is both tedious & cumbersome.

I have read and understood Custom Post Types & Custom Taxonomies and how they work. I am rather excited about implementing them. However there is some content I am finding difficult to organise.

    * An existing database table of about 4,000 Condominium Projects

Each entry in the Condominiums table has some ""bio-data"" like Year Completed, No. of Units, Facilities, Amenities etc.

Currently each listing in my site has an ajax query that fetches information from this table on demand.

In the new site, I intend to have a link to the respective condominium in each property listing.
This link should display information about the specific condo and display 'results' of matching listings.

Also, some condos have long article reviews done for them. In my current site, these reviews are displayed in the blog section. Separated altogether.

So here's my question.

How would I connect everything together. A duplicate perhaps? Taxonomy & Post for each condo? That will mean over 3,000 unique entries. Wouldn't that be an ""overkill""?

If it is a taxonomy, the link will probably display all posts (listings) that have that condo name. But it wouldn't link to an actual page of either it's review or bio-data.

Any thoughts will be very much appreciated... Please feel free to ask if I have missed out any vital information!

I don't have too much experience with this kindof thing, but it seems as though it isn't working.

Google PageSpeed is listing out a whole bunch of files which *should* be compressed but aren't (all of my js and css I think)

Looking at firefox's `net` panel, I think I've verified that these are **not** being compressed, though I do see `Accept Encoding: gzip, deflate`

Part of the problem is maybe the `Content-Type` of the js is set to `application/x-javascript` which doesn't appear to be referenced in the below code. The css *is* however `text/css`

Honestly (haven't done much googling on this yet), I don't even know how to change the content-type of things, so if thats part of the problem, and its an easy eplanation (or snippet), than please include it in your answer.

I don't have too much experience with this kindof thing, but it seems as though it isn't working.

Google PageSpeed is listing out a whole bunch of files which *should* be compressed but aren't (all of my js and css I think)

Looking at firefox's `net` panel, I think I've verified that these are **not** being compressed, though I do see `Accept Encoding: gzip, deflate`

Part of the problem is maybe the `Content-Type` of the js is set to `application/x-javascript` which doesn't appear to be referenced in the below code. The css *is* however `text/css`

Honestly (haven't done much googling on this yet), I don't even know how to change the content-type of things, so if thats part of the problem, and its an easy eplanation (or snippet), than please include it in your answer.

Im considering using WordPress for a website that, while for business, is simply a showcase of items rather than needing actual shopping cart abilities. Our items are custom made and made-on-demand so we dont want to deal with shopping carts, but we do want to implore a showcase site with an order queue (for users to see where their commission is in our process).

I see many ecommerce plugins for WordPress but do not see one made for my situation. What kind of plugins and tools can I expect to use for WordPress to achieve having an order queue.  With Custom Content Types, I know I could simply create the order queue using that. However, one extra thing I want to do that is probably beyond that plugin's capability is to have a notification emailed to each person on the order queue. That way, when we change the status of an order# in that queue (i.e. putting a customer's order from ""ASSEMBLY"" to ""Ready to ship"" status), said customer get a form email sent to them instead of manually having to ""stalk"" our site in order to find out the status of an order.

Wordpress is super user-friendly and flexible to use, easy to update/install themes/plugins, almost any kind of plugins are available, beautiful/elegant themes are available, easy to design. But it lacks in functionality of a complete CMS.


My Question is, If I have to select just one framework between Drupal and Wordpress which one you would suggest and Why?

Thanks in advance for your help. 

NB: I don't know why My Wordpress clients are always happy with the result.But I am happy with the Drupal projects output though it takes very longer time to finish a project than Wordpress and my drupal clients are not always happy with the design/ management features. This is because Drupal sucks at usability? and looks complex to users?

-Ajax and Javascript features/module

-Secure and Stable

- Lots of video learning resource :)

I'm not a geek, however based on my research WP, Joomla failed- custom functionality is rather difficult.

I like Drupal, but came across Umbraco and dotCMS, which claims to be better than any PHP CMS. 
I need you review for my requirements, please.

Learning a new language is not big trouble for me.

Thanks,
Aryan

One of my more popular wordpress sites just came under a new type of comment spam attack tonight. A bot is copying real comments from last year, and resubmitting them as different users on other posts. The first one fooled me since it was so context-appropriate. I was tipped off when it got greedy and submitted the same comment twice in a row in different posts. If it hadn't done that I might not have noticed it for a while.

I have several Q's: 

 1. Has anyone else seen this type of spam before? It's getting through Askimet, so I have to think it's a new technique. I'm marking them all as spam, so hopefully it'll learn?
 2. If this is a known problem, are there other anti-spam plugins which could help? I'm not keen on closing comments on posts older than 60 days, which apparently is a newish built-in option for combating comment spam.

But then, in my theme(and i suppose themes in general) there is a link to the previous post and next post, which also uses 'the title' filter. So finally I have:

The last conditional basically makes sure that it is the title of the post that is being printed, not the title of the next or previous post. This works but I am not sure how well it will work given different themes...It seems like terribly hacked together. Any advice from wordpress gurus out there? I am worried that the title would be modified for other reasons and the conditional will fail.

I have a plugin called simple-nav-archives, and I'm expanding it to be able to list archives in places other than the navigation, so obviously, it needs a new name.

However, there are currently thousands of people (if the download count means anything) who use my plugin, and I want them to switch to my new one, but I'm not sure the easiest way to facilitate this transition.

Here is what I'm considering:

**Current Strategy:** Upload the new version of my plugin with the new name to the repository. Then, create a new version of the existing plugin that displays some sort of semi-annoying message on the plugins page informing the user that simple-nav-archives is no longer being supported and there is a new version with a new name by the same developer.

Is this the best option? It seems like there must, or at least should, be a better way.

For simplicity, this will more or less be a ""product catalog,"" or a listing of many items and their attributes.  Thus far I have developed a custom post type (items), the associated taxonomy and some custom meta (eventually for the SKU of each item), and have succesfully developed the barebones pages to display the post type/taxonomy/meta.

The final part is basically figuring out how to develop ""variations"" into this post type.  Each item would require something like: length, width, color, shape, where each length may have a different width/color/shape.  Currently, I have this information saved into a CSV, and then a little PHP script pulls up the CSV (concatenates the filename based on the title of the post), and then displays the data as an HTML table.  This is great, except there's no (good) way for a user to search/query (ie - ""I want to see all items with a color of X"").

I've tried digging into an existing ecommerce plugin/theme I have (Express Store), but the code is a bit ""thick"" for my skill level.  As far as I can tell, this plugin builds its own tables that are used for the products/categories/variations, but this seems overkill for my needs.

Therefore, my question is, what's the best way to accomplish this?  Should this just be another custom meta for this post type?  Or do I need to start looking into building a custom table?  Is there any way to incorporate using a CSV, to avoid having to manually enter this data for each item?

My thinking is maybe I can develop the custom meta (size/width/color/shape), and then have a small PHP script that inserts the CSV into the meta.  Does this sound correct?  How can I be sure that the width/color/shape will correspond to the correct size (ie - maintain hierarchy)?

    			'show_ui' => true
    			); 

    $post_types =get_post_types($post_args);


this above code doesn't return anything even though genre is a taxonomy that is registered to the 'book' post type.   

if i have a custom post type of 'books' with some custom taxonomies of say, 'author' and 'genre'... i'd like to use get_post_type to return the post type associated with 'genre'... obviously 'books'.  i'm trying to make something that will help set the post_type parameter in get_posts.. since that only searches posts by default and not custom post types.  obviously i could just set the post_type parameter, but i want to make it forward compatible with any future post types i might use in my different themes.
