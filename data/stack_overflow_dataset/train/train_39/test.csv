It seems like it should work but there are two problems.

1. When I manually added the script like this `<script src=""<?php bloginfo('template_url'); ?>/nivo-slider/jquery.nivo.slider.pack.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>` inside the head tags, Nivo-slider did show up. Now it won't start. I know it finds the jquery.nivo.slider.pack.js because when I load it in the browser and look at the source the link to that js file is correct.

2. This adds this text `http://example.com/wp-content/themes/pingst` (well except it's the domain the site is placed on and not example.com) before the doctype and any thing else when looking at the source in the browser.

This is the complete output (got tired of change the domain-name to example.com, it's no secret anyway).

                        <p>Pingstförsamlingen i Mörlunda finns till för vanliga<br />
    människor, som du och jag. Med våra förtjänster och våra<br />
    dåliga sidor. Både ung, gammal och de som är någonstans mitt<br />
    i mellan. Människorna som delar församlingsgemenskapen är på<br />
    många sätt olika. Men det som förenar är tron på Jesus, inte<br />
    bara som historisk person, utan framförallt levande<br />
    idag. Jesus är den som ger människan ett liv med mål och<br />
    
    mening.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Vi kan uppleva många saker i livet som meningsfullt;<br />
    relationer, barn, barnbarn och så vidare. Men innerst inne<br />
    längtar vi alla efter något mer. Vi brottas med frågan om<br />
    den den yttersta meningen med tillvaron, om våra liv<br />
    verkligen spelar roll och vad som händer efter<br />
    döden. Predikaren säger om Gud att ”evigheten har han lagt i<br />
    människornas hjärtan.” Vi kan vara så upptagna i livet med<br />
    
    annat att vi inte hör frågorna från djupet av våra hjärtan,<br />
    men likväl finns de där. I Jesus Kristus kan dessa frågor få<br />
    ett svar.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Välkommen att vara med på en gudstjänst, cafékväll,<br />
    tonår eller något annat som händer.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I församlingen finns också människor som är beredda att<br />
    samtala med dig som vill det. Det finns inga utbildade<br />
    terapeuter, men medmänniskor som vill ta dig på allvar och<br />
    
    är beredda att både lyssna på dig och dela sina egna<br />
    erfarenheter om livet tillsammans med Jesus.</p>

",wordpress,wordpress-theming,,,,,open,0,2352,4,"Add javascript to theme I'm trying to add the Nivo-slider code (not the WP plugin) to a theme. I've done it by adding this to the functions.php: 

    /* Add scripts for theme to work*/
    function theme_add_scripts() {
      wp_enqueue_script('jquery'); //omit if jQuery already included
      wp_enqueue_script('nivoslider',  bloginfo('stylesheet_url') . '/wp-content/themes/pingst/nivo-slider/jquery.nivo.slider.pack.js', 'jquery', '2.7.1');
      }
    add_action('init', 'theme_add_scripts');

It seems like it should work but there are two problems.

1. When I manually added the script like this `<script src=""<?php bloginfo('template_url'); ?>/nivo-slider/jquery.nivo.slider.pack.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>` inside the head tags, Nivo-slider did show up. Now it won't start. I know it finds the jquery.nivo.slider.pack.js because when I load it in the browser and look at the source the link to that js file is correct.

2. This adds this text `http://example.com/wp-content/themes/pingst` (well except it's the domain the site is placed on and not example.com) before the doctype and any thing else when looking at the source in the browser.

This is the complete output (got tired of change the domain-name to example.com, it's no secret anyway).

                        <p>Pingstförsamlingen i Mörlunda finns till för vanliga<br />
    människor, som du och jag. Med våra förtjänster och våra<br />
    dåliga sidor. Både ung, gammal och de som är någonstans mitt<br />
    i mellan. Människorna som delar församlingsgemenskapen är på<br />
    många sätt olika. Men det som förenar är tron på Jesus, inte<br />
    bara som historisk person, utan framförallt levande<br />
    idag. Jesus är den som ger människan ett liv med mål och<br />
    
    mening.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Vi kan uppleva många saker i livet som meningsfullt;<br />
    relationer, barn, barnbarn och så vidare. Men innerst inne<br />
    längtar vi alla efter något mer. Vi brottas med frågan om<br />
    den den yttersta meningen med tillvaron, om våra liv<br />
    verkligen spelar roll och vad som händer efter<br />
    döden. Predikaren säger om Gud att ”evigheten har han lagt i<br />
    människornas hjärtan.” Vi kan vara så upptagna i livet med<br />
    
    annat att vi inte hör frågorna från djupet av våra hjärtan,<br />
    men likväl finns de där. I Jesus Kristus kan dessa frågor få<br />
    ett svar.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Välkommen att vara med på en gudstjänst, cafékväll,<br />
    tonår eller något annat som händer.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I församlingen finns också människor som är beredda att<br />
    samtala med dig som vill det. Det finns inga utbildade<br />
    terapeuter, men medmänniskor som vill ta dig på allvar och<br />
    
    är beredda att både lyssna på dig och dela sina egna<br />
    erfarenheter om livet tillsammans med Jesus.</p>

I'll do some more research if I get the project, but need some ideas for now. I'm trying to figure out a good solution that won't take several months to develop but will still provide good flexibility for future enhancements.

My options I believe are:

    cms+e-commerce plugin (e.g. drupal+ubercart)
    e-commerce platform that is extendable (e.g. magento)
    framework+e-commerce platform (e.g. ci+magento)

The site will be similar to etsy where users can have items that they sell with their own portfolio page. The client wants to add many custom features as well. Also, the site will serve up a lot of images and audio.

I'm concerned that using strictly a e-commerce platform will give me a lot of obstacles to overcome rather than use just a cart+framework. I know Magento is written on Zend, but while I have used Magento, I'm not very familiar with Zend and it seems to take quite a while to learn.

I have never used ubercart,wp e-commerce, or virtuemart, so I'm not sure of the limitations. The products will not need to be configurable. But we will need to store financial information. I'm thinking braintree's vault or authorize.net cim.

I'd like to do the framework+ecommerce platform route. But the client would also like a lower price option, I'm leaning towards drupal+ubercart.

Just would like some opinions from personal experience.
