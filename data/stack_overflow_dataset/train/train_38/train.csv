First an overview: What I am trying to do it create a server application for all of the clients in my organization to connect to. I think the best way to do this is to use a web service. Please correct me if I am wrong!

Anyway, if I use a web service I need the web service(server) to connect to the database. In MS Visual studio when you add a web service project the data menu disappears and you can't add a data source to the project. There may be a workaround for this by hand coding this, but I am not sure how to do it. This is my first time working with a web service and ASP.NET so I am a real noob in this area.

And I have created the many wrapper classes for the web services, however I found the precess is very repetitive. There are more than 200 web services methods, and I am exposing half of them in my wrapper functions/classes. 

All wrapper functions look very similiar with minor difference: constructing difference input, call web services method, check result, return result. I feel I am repeating code every time when I create new wrapper method.

I tried to follow above recommendation. In my recent project, I am using web services provided other team. And I have created the many wrapper classes for the web services, however I found the precess is very repetitive. There are more than 200 web services methods, and I am exposing half of them in my wrapper functions/classes. 

All wrapper functions look very similiar with minor difference: constructing difference input, call web services method, check result, return result. I feel I am repeating code every time when I create new wrapper method.

Now, when i change it to an ssl(and the ssl is working as far as i can hit other web pages using https), so i pass in https://denny.dog.com/Test.svc i get a web page back but this time it says svcutil.exe http://ser04/Test.svc.

So the https call comes back as http, it comes back as the name of the server.  What have i not configured so that it would come back correctly?.

The objects of the services are scattered in several packages.  
For both performance and dynamic configuration reasons I want to create the JAXB context which will be used by the CXF client / server services.
I prefer specifying it once on the bus level, but if that isn't possible I guess controlling it on the service level will be good enough.

So I set out on a google journey to find out what web servers exist (on a Linux machine, though it's interesting to hear the answer without that limitation).

From what I could find, it seems that there are two viable options: [Apache Tomcat][1] and [Sun Java Server][2]. 

What are the reason to choose one on top of the other? what are the strength of each and what are the weaknesses? Or, perhaps, there is a third one which is much easier, flexible and less cumbersome.

At the moment the way the API will look (e.g. SOAP, REST, RPC) is completely open and we haven't made any decisions yet, so I'm interested in both examples of web APIs people think are good, and why you think that.

What I'm interested in is opinions from people using different languages (we're likely to be offering the API to people using a number of platforms, particularly including .NET, Java, ActionScript and JavaScript) about web APIs that you think are good examples, and that you've had good experiences with.

Some points I'd like to cover:

1. Do you prefer SOAP type services or REST/RPC style ones? I suspect that people with platform support (e.g. .NET, Java) will prefer SOAP ones and people using languages without platform support will prefer the others, but I'd like to validate that assumption.

2. Do you care whether an API is actually RESTful or whether it is a plain old RPC style HTTP GET/POST? If so, why do you care? Is it more important that and API describes itself correctly (i.e. don't claim to be RESTful if it's RPC style) than whether it actually is one of the two?

3. We need to verify who us using the service. I've been looking at the Amazon S3 authentication which uses a public identifier and a private token that's used to hash the parameters of the request into a verification token (this is also similar to flickr). Have you used this type of authentication before, and how did you get on with it? Are there any hash algorithms you find problematic (i.e. not supported by your platform)? Would you prefer to send the hash in an HTTP header or in the URI?

Also, any other opinions and points to cover would be useful.

I'm deliberately staying vague on the actual type of API we're implementing, as I'm looking for general guidance in terms of what people think are good APIs and implementation mechanisms, so this post and its answers will be useful to more people in the future.

I need to debug a Sharepoint WCF service that is deployed for Sharepoint 2010. However, a colleague needs to debug another Sharepoint service deployed on the same phyical machine. If we debug at the same time strange things occur with the Visual Studio debugger. Often, his debugger would break at breakpoints I have set, or I am seeing exceptions raised by his code. Mind you, we are debugging different services in different solutions. From the information I have gathered, this might be because there is only one w3wp process per application pool that both the Visual Studio Debugger instances attach to.
So I tried running my service in another applicaion pool to get a different w3wp.exe to attach to. Here is what I tried, but I am not sure, if what I attempted makes any sense, please clarify:

IIS Manager shows that there are two different Sharepoint application pools (excluding the one for Central Adminisitration) and a Site for each. So I tried deploying my service using the other application pool by setting the deployment location to the URL of the other site. However the virtual _vti_bin directory of the service still maps to the same physical directory `...\Web Server Extensions\14\ISAPI\`. Deploying from Visual Studio works, but getting a ServiceReference does not. Trying to open `<url>/_vti_bin/MyService.svc/MEX` shows an error page telling me that therer is already a binding instance associated to the URL. So, I guess this is either not the way to do this, or it is simply not possible to ""isolate"" services in this way. I am very hesitant to just trial-and-error with IIS Manager or Sharepoint Central Administration settings, because I feel I don't know enough to avoid screwing things up.

<Blockquote>
I have a solution containing two projects: a webservice project and a web app project which has a web reference to the webservice project (the web app project is simply a test case).

My webservice project includes a class file containing multiple public structs.  I can use these just fine from within the webservice project itself.  However, I'm not able to see or reference the structs from within the web app project.

Isn't it true that when you add a web reference to a web service, you essentially get an ""object"" version of the webservice?  In that case I expect to be able to access any public members of the webservice.

I have previously created services that reference associated projects, and when I consume the service, I have access to the referenced projects and their members.  Why don't I have access to a class file that's in the same project as the service?

The Namespace for the webservice (asmx) and the class file (cs) are the same.  In the web app, I have a using statement for the web reference.  I DO have access to the webmethods from the asmx, just not the associated class files and their public members...

The server would then generate a proper url to the new piano resource and update accordingly:

Users won't have roles - so only one type of user. Once logged in, will be able to work with his articles (create, read, update).

Given this scenario, what's the best way to create an authentication and authorization mechanism?

I am opened to suggestions here, but here is my idea on how to do this, maybe we can work on it:

- user provides username / password

- servers checks user/pass - if ok creates and stores a token (associated to the userId) which is returned to the user

- when the user wants to see his articles, he provides that token; based on the token, the userId is determined and his article list is return so he can select one

If this design is ok (I've seen it used on other applications) I have some questions:

1. Why use token at all? I know that one advantage of using tokens is that afterwards I can send the token to some application and let that application to stuff on my behalf; however, this is not the case here - only the user will interact with his articles - he doesn't want to allow anyone else access to them. 

2. If a secured connection in used, would this be safer than sending user/pass for every response? 

3. Would it be faster? I know it's faster to query a table with a few entries, than to query a table with all the user entries - could this be an argument of using tokens?

Users will be mobile apps and I don't want to make them worry about this - they will have a settings screen where they provide username / password; How I picture this:

-user stars the application and wants to see his articles

2 things can happen:

A: application doesn't have a token from a previous login: it requests a new one based on user/pass; then, with the new token, it requests the articles 

B: application has a token from a previous login; it uses that token to request the articles but receives a message that the token is expired. goto A

All this will be transparent to the user.

How to send username/password? query strings / headers?

How to send authentication token? query strings / headers?

What about OAuth? Would it be suitable in this scenario? From what I've read, oauth is used when you want a third party application to access your account - eg a custom twitter app - this is not the case here.

I want to allow only registered domains to have the possibility to request our data.
For server-side languages, one possibility is to generate a secret key, wich they can use to request data, but a client can install it on any domain he wants, and for js-requests it would not work at all, since anyone can see the key.

My question is:
Is it possible at all? And if yes, how?

Thanks in advance!

I am also assuming that many users would like to watch the same movie at the same time but using Unicase and not multicast.

Can you please help me on where to start? what kind of servers I would need to get? I was also thinking about getting iptv devices that cost around 40-50$ and set them up for every tv in the apartments.
