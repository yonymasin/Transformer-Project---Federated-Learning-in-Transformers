I'm hosting the site on a remote server via IIS7. Recently I've succeedded at getting the webservice to return the user's timetable, which works like a charm. 

However, now I also need to be able to retrieve a user's test results via this web service. To do this, my web service calls *another*, existing web service to retrieve the results, then formats them and returns them to the user. 

I first created a test webservice to do this, which works perfectly- I load my web service's wsdl file in SoapUI, and it returns the desired results (by calling the other webservice). 

However, when implementing the method into the actual project, it fails. Apparently there's a hickup caused by elements in the web.config file;

With ... being the IP address and port number.

If I don't include it then I can access the files on the site just fine, but, well, then I'm obviously unable to call the second web service.

Am I doing something wrong with this block of code? Or is there something else that I'm missing?

I'm hosting the site on a remote server via IIS7. Recently I've succeedded at getting the webservice to return the user's timetable, which works like a charm. 

However, now I also need to be able to retrieve a user's test results via this web service. To do this, my web service calls *another*, existing web service to retrieve the results, then formats them and returns them to the user. 

I first created a test webservice to do this, which works perfectly- I load my web service's wsdl file in SoapUI, and it returns the desired results (by calling the other webservice). 

However, when implementing the method into the actual project, it fails. Apparently there's a hickup caused by elements in the web.config file;

    <configuration>
      ...
      <applicationSettings>
        <OAuthServiceProvider.Properties.Settings>

With ... being the IP address and port number. When I include this piece of code (which is automatically generated by adding the web reference), I get an error saying ""The remote server returned an error: (500) Internal Server Error"" whenever I try to access the web reference (or any other file on the site, for that matter). If I don't include it then I can access the files on the site just fine, but, well, then I'm obviously unable to call the second web service.

Am I doing something wrong with this block of code? Or is there something else that I'm missing?

 1. Well I know I could use RemoteAddrFilter and filter the IP and although it's spoof-able it could be ""close enough"" but unfortunately I'm stuck with version 6 of Tomcat.
 2. If I had complete freedom I could setup this service on a different port and then just use iptables to restrict it but unfortunately it has to be same instance of Tomcat and same web application and I am not familiar with a way to restrict a connector to certain areas in a web app.
 3. The application manages it's own security system which cannot be used for authenticating the ""caller machine"" for ""historical"" reasons that said making several security constraints is fine but [specification][1] here says that one can have only one login-config element so even if I write a different constraint for the restricted URLs I will not be able to block it by requiring a user certificate for example(thus identifying the calling machine) because I already have a login-config. 

This more of a ""how to do it best"" question rather then ""I don't know how to do it"" because there are plenty of hacky ways to set this up but we don't want to slip to the dark side now do we? 

I must say I did try to research the subject but I haven't found any obvious solutions and yet if I missed something elegant and obvious I will be more then happy to hear about it(non trivial solutions are very welcome too :) ) , so thanks for any ideas.

The situation requires a number of tablets constantly communicating with the database. The database needs to be invisible so all the functions that a tablet can do like: 

 - Login
 - Retrieve jobs/Submit completed Jobs 
 - Submit Images related to job (evidence)
 - Retrieve messages/Submit Feedback/Messages
 - Retrieve latest instruction PDFs/Read then and confirm through a ""sign""
 - Submit tablet location periodically

Now, on the administration side, once an employee is hired, he is assigned a tablet from the pol and a GUID is generated on the server database that bind the employee to the tablet.

Upon login from tablet, I need to send a simple request like
http://www.holylollypop.com/tablet/login/*?EmployeeID* and *?GUID*

Receiving this, the MVC site goes back to the actual DB and replies if login is granted or not. If success, tablet then sends GPS data as a JSON.
http://www.holylollypop.com/tablet/gps/*?EmployeeID* and *?GUID* and *?GPS JSON*

As you can see, I'm just using a token/API system here. I'm not doing any through sessions or compression or detecting if the tablet died or still active. All is just On-demand.

Now, I have been looking at a number of tutorials and it seems that most people are adding/attaching WCF service into their MVC site. The MVC site I'm attempting doesn't entertain with web pages. Unless there is a valid token, there will be a simple index page telling user to go away.

I must admit I lack knowledge of web services but at the same time, I just need a push in the right direction here with some code and I'll figure out the Model-View-Controller thing. Currently, I have a ASP MVC 3 Razer project in my solution that is able to access my DataAccessProxy project which in turn has access to the actual LINQ DBML.

Any kind of help will be greatly appreciated!

I was thinking maybe it's something to do with packet sizes or something? Anyways any ideas or tips are certainly appreciated. I know this is a programming forum and perhaps this is a networking question, but honestly we're both devs running the same piece of code. I'm just curious why it's so much slower on her machine.  

Thanks for any help,

Now my problem is, that *every* function specifies the same argument and return type. And this type is then specified as being *string*!

Example:

    <definitions targetNamespace=""java:the.custom.namespace"" xmlns=""http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/wsdl/"" xmlns:tns=""java:the.custom.namespace"" xmlns:xsi=""http://www.w3.org/1999/XMLSchema-instance"" xmlns:xsd=""http://www.w3.org/1999/XMLSchema"" xmlns:soap=""http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/wsdl/soap/"">
     <types>
        <schema targetNamespace=""java:the.custom.namespace"" xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/XMLSchema"" /> 
      </types>
      <message name=""LegacySystemRequest"">
        <part name=""arg0"" type=""xsd:string"" /> 
      </message>
      <message name=""LegacySystemResponse"">
        <part name=""return"" type=""xsd:string"" />
