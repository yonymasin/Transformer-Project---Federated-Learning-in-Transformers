The problem is I need to get that dynamically as it can get quite deeply nested. 

So to get to the desired level, I would do this (which does work as above).

    main_hash.send(:fetch, ""Farming"").send(:fetch, ""children"").send(:fetch, ""Organic Gas"").send(:fetch, ""children"")

 It would really be great if I could call ""send"" method dynamically like below (obviously it won't work).

    main_hash.send(:try, 'send(:fetch, ""Farming"").send(:fetch, ""children"").send(:fetch, ""Organic Gas"").send(:fetch, ""children"")')

I hope it makes it clear what I want to achieve. I have gone through all Ruby Hash's built in function and I can't get the one suited for my need. 

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

",ruby,dynamic,hash,nested,fetch,,open,0,348,5,"Ruby nested hash fetching dynamically I have an issue trying to update a nested Hash using a key.

The nested hash I have is like this:

    main_hash = {

To test things out, I wrote a small program in ruby (echo client server) where i used XREQ and XREP sockets. The client application is sending messages to server (consecutive numbers) and getting them back in responce. The interval between sendings is 0.1s.
Everything works... until a certain moment. When current number reaches about 400, server just freezes and doesn't respond to client anymore. I tested this on several computers, and still got that strange issue.

I'm trying to figure out two last things. I'm using the [cache_buster][1] filter, but trying to figure out how to pass a version number to it instead of just the random hash.

It seems as though it would accept a block to use for the key generator: http://screencast.com/t/z4n1hS8l but whenever I try and pass what I believe to be a block, which is using a previously declared OURVERSION constant to set the filename, it errors that it expected 0 arguments. Not sure how to get that working.

Also was wondering if anyone has recommendations on the javascript minifier to use, and a filter that might connect with that.

    b = ""harhar""
    a[:test] = b


The scope of `File A` is inside a module::class (not the main global scope) and when I try and access the `a` variable within `File B` I get an error saying the `a` variable isn't in the current scope.

I've read somewhere about included files being in their own scope so as not to clash, if so, what is the convention for getting around this?

Thanks so much in advanced :D

For example

If I give the gem the measurement of

I'm trying to get the result
<pre>
1 foot, 3 inches

The conversion tools I've seen, I'd have to tell the convertor to try to convert to feet, and then decide which is the most appropriate measurement.
