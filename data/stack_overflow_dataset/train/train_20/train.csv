### Finally, my question! 

Given that sending invalid XML to the XMPP server kicks me off, is there any way using Ruby I can validate (and, preferably, *correct*) the XML before sending it to the XMPP server? Most likely, *correcting* it will be a matter of my writing additional code for each case where Tidy isn't producing valid XML, but I'd at least like to stop the script from crashing. So, how can I validate the XML before sending it to the XMPP server?

### Finally, my question! 

Given that sending invalid XML to the XMPP server kicks me off, is there any way using Ruby I can validate (and, preferably, *correct*) the XML before sending it to the XMPP server? Most likely, *correcting* it will be a matter of my writing additional code for each case where Tidy isn't producing valid XML, but I'd at least like to stop the script from crashing. So, how can I validate the XML before sending it to the XMPP server?

The old Ruby 1.8.7 is located in my ~/usr/bin/ruby directory while the new Ruby 1.9.2 is in ~/usr/local/bin/ruby.  Someone said that I need to put the new version of Ruby's directory in the PATH prior to the old version's directory so that the system looks there first - is this correct?  If so, can anyone provide step by step instructions on how to do this? 

2. I’ve created a new directory but can’t seem to figure out the correct way to add that directory to my PATH using the Terminal bash shell.  I tried using the instructions that I found here (http://www.macgasm.net/2008/04/10/ad...thin-terminal/) twice but they didn't work for me.  The directory containing my program (""Ruby_Programs"") shows up in the PATH but when I try to run ""ruby newprogram.rb"" from the command line it results in "":ruby: No such file or directory -- newprogram.rb (LoadError)"".

Fast forward to today. I am trying to run a very simple rack application I wrote. Just a one liner basically to study rack. When I go to localhost:9292, the old application I downloaded before comes up in my browser. I have no idea why this is happening and since I don't need the app, I closed everything and deleted that old application from my computer. I then tried 'localhost:9292' again, and oddly, that same application came up. 

Even when I don't run anything, rack or otherwise, any time I go to localhost:9292, I get that ghost application showing up.

It was a ruby application running on rack. The port I used to view it was localhost:9292.

Fast forward to today. I am trying to run a very simple rack application I wrote. Just a one liner basically to study rack. When I go to localhost:9292, the old application I downloaded before comes up in my browser. I have no idea why this is happening and since I don't need the app, I closed everything and deleted that old application from my computer. I then tried 'localhost:9292' again, and oddly, that same application came up. 

Even when I don't run anything, rack or otherwise, any time I go to localhost:9292, I get that ghost application showing up.

They are typically up to 6 decimal places. When a new request is received, I calculate the distance between the last recorded loc and the long/lat in the params of the request. If the distance is greater than a certain threshold of miles apart, I update the current loc. 

**Problem:** I use the geokit gem/plugin to calculate the distance between the locs. Very rarely, a bug shows up (the zero distance bug mentioned on the author's site - I'm using 1.4.1 which claims the bug is fixed, but I still see it occurring *shrug*) that causes the distance calc to return something wildly inaccurate when calculating the distance between two points that are identical (this occurs if the user is not moving). This is causing updates to the user's current loc that should not be happening. You're probably wondering - well if it's just updating the loc to be exactly the same coordinates, who cares? Well, the answer is that a bunch of other crap occurs when the loc is updated that makes it an actual issue.

**Attempted Solution:** I tried to add in logic to manually check if the two locs are identical before calculating the distance and then just skipping the calc and not updating if that is the case. The incoming parameters are long/lats with 6 decimal precision; whereas, in my database, I store the values as floats, which appears to only store 4 decimal places. This is causing my float comparison to always fail and the inappropriate loc updates continue to occur. 

Phew, ok so the actual question is: How should I perform this comparison? Should I truncate 2 of the decimal places from the incoming lat/longs, round up somehow so the fourth digit is correct and then compare? Or, should I do a ""within a certain range"" sort of comparison (e.g. reported_loc.long > current_loc.long - .0001 && reported_loc.long < current_loc.long + .0001)? Also some help any existing ruby gem/plugins or built in functions to do this sort of thing would be much appreciated.

Here is sample output from the log:

    [update_loc] Last location history record at lat: 41.5024, long: -81.6816
    [update_loc] Current loc at lat: 41.502467, long: -81.681623
    [update_loc] Distance from current loc and last loc history: 5795.10615113555 miles

Think of a generic database adapter with abstract classes like Connection, Table, Column, etc. and specific subclasses of these for a particular database.

In an attempt to be DRY, I declare the attributes of each abstract class (with default values) as a class constant Array called `ATTRIBUTES`. Since ruby doesn't support true abstract classes, I dynamically create methods that raise an exception if they're called on the abstract class. For example:

    module MyApplication

I have more than a handful of these abstract classes, and I've copied nearly the same code into each one to create these stub methods (only the attributes list and class name are different). I've tried numerous ways to put this code into a module that I can include (or extend?) from each abstract class, but my brain is now folded in on itself trying to sort out the meta-programming details of how to get this to work. :)

 * The first i = 0, i = i + 1 (why is that neccesary here?)
 * details = rows.collect do |row| what syntax is this for?  a array? or what class is using from nokogiri? does nokogiri has anything to do with this or is it only RUBY handling an object.
 * detail = {} you see this. why would you want to use this? is this doing something I am not seing?
 * I do understand .collect do |name,xpath| because of the top is in order in name , xpath 
 * detail[name] = row.at_xpath(xpath).to_s.strip I guess this is saying that if I call detail[:sku] it will make that row at that xpath to a string strip? 

what does .map do? is there a syntax tutorial in nokogiri page for this? and why did he had to repeat all data in the #walk trough paginator instead of just using idk some variable?

          words.each do |w|
            if w.eql? word.value
              Synonym.create :value => w, :parent_id => word.id
            end
          end
        end
      end

The problem occurs on the last part, Word.create(:value => first_word)
I receive an exception here that tries to cast it to a float for some reason, but I have no idea why.

The migration schema' for both models:

    class CreateWords < ActiveRecord::Migration
      def self.up
        create_table :words do |t|
          t.string :value, :null => false
          t.timestamps
        end
      end
    
      def self.down
        drop_table :words
      end
    end
    
    class CreateSynonyms < ActiveRecord::Migration
      def self.up
        create_table :synonyms do |t|
          t.integer :word_id, :null => false
          t.string :value, :null => false

      end

now it is now time for me to ask my own question. well, i am requesting more than a simple answer to a simple question. i would like help/advice on my code.

here's the backstory. last week, i decided to embark on the wonderful journey of writing a chess engine in ruby. (!) i have had no formal ruby education -- just picked it up over the past few years -- but i am proud of the progress so far. the first step (before any move generation, AI, search trees, etc.) is to get a solid board representation so the computer and i can effectively communicate the game state to one another. the board representation i am using here is of the 64-bitstring variety. (i implemented one using 0x88 board rep'n too, but that isn't here. from what i understand, having a several representations on hand in memory will be most useful to solve various number-crunching issues that will appear along the way. ) 

i am unsure of the etiquette on this type of thing, but here is my code (244 lines):

    =begin
    A game of chess can be played in the terminal!
    User(s) must know the rules because the program knows none.
    Moves must be entered as ""initial_square-terminal_square"", 
      where the squares must be given in algebraic chess notation
      and any whitespace is ok in that entered string.
    The program checks if initial square contains a piece of your color
      and if the termnal square does not.
    There are no other restrictions on piece movement.
    No saving, loading, undoing, etc.
    Game runs in an infinite loop, so quit with Ctrl-C.

all too often, we lose sight of efficiency upfront and it comes back to haunt us in the later stages of a program, causing many headaches. i would like to not have to uproot all my progress two weeks from now because of some foolish implementation i made today. if anyone can offer any advice on the beginnings of this chess engine, it would be so greatly appreciated.


thanks and happy to be a member finally,

matt",ruby,chess,,,,04/12/2012 22:43:18,not a real question,1,3047,3,"ruby chess engine this is my first post here, as i am brand new to stackoverflow. i have joined because these forums are always the most helpful when searching for answers to my ever-prevalent programming questions. 

now it is now time for me to ask my own question. well, i am requesting more than a simple answer to a simple question. i would like help/advice on my code.

here's the backstory. last week, i decided to embark on the wonderful journey of writing a chess engine in ruby. (!) i have had no formal ruby education -- just picked it up over the past few years -- but i am proud of the progress so far. the first step (before any move generation, AI, search trees, etc.) is to get a solid board representation so the computer and i can effectively communicate the game state to one another. the board representation i am using here is of the 64-bitstring variety. (i implemented one using 0x88 board rep'n too, but that isn't here. from what i understand, having a several representations on hand in memory will be most useful to solve various number-crunching issues that will appear along the way. ) 

i am unsure of the etiquette on this type of thing, but here is my code (244 lines):

    #!/usr/bin/env ruby
    #################################################
    =begin
    A game of chess can be played in the terminal!
    User(s) must know the rules because the program knows none.
    Moves must be entered as ""initial_square-terminal_square"", 
      where the squares must be given in algebraic chess notation
      and any whitespace is ok in that entered string.
    The program checks if initial square contains a piece of your color
      and if the termnal square does not.
    There are no other restrictions on piece movement.
    No saving, loading, undoing, etc.
    Game runs in an infinite loop, so quit with Ctrl-C.

I benefited from the answers of Ingenu, however even after re-reading Why's poignant guide to ruby, I cannot see how I can make use of two classes by passing variables between them.

During the last 5 days, I learned the basics of inheritance, singleton methods and eval methods. I even read about [template methods][3], but since I have no programming background, I'm in no position to learn from other languages.

I improved my code and am asking for further help. To achieve syntax highlighting, I [placed the code into GitHub][2]. I also commented it and added further explanations in the README. Unfortunately while improving, I also populated the code a bit. But this was required for me to study the methods and errors.

I used inheritance to solve my problem [in my previous question][4] but now it doesn't work and I am not sure if inheritance was the missing part. To express my confusion, I would like to mention that I studied rails a bit in the past and I must say that a belongs_to could help me a lot here. But as I said, I am confused and want to learn it from ground.

So I would be very happy if someone can check [my code][5] and guide me in the right direction.

http://myrailsapp.com/blog/
http://myrailsapp.com/coupons/

Blog is powered by wordpress and similarly the coupons section is powered by PHP/Mysql.

The traffic of my website has increased a lot over the last 6 months. So, the thought was to move Blog and coupons on a different server and hence i dont need to run mysql/php etc where my rails app is running, reducing my memory footprint as much as I can.

1. Is the above thought process correct?
2. How much SEO impact would I have, if I move from subdirectory to subdomain and set up 301 redirects. My subdirectory structure for coupons is indexed quite well in Google.. So any mistake here could be costly :(
3. I am not an expert on Nginx, so I ended up writing whatever I could:

    location ^~ /coupons/ {

      rewrite ^/coupons(.*) http://coupons.myrailsapp.com$1 permanent;

    }

Would that set up 301 redirects correctly? Is there something else that I am missing here? Or is that all about it? Anything else in the above code that I must take care as far as SEO also goes..

       Sub Menu 2
       .... etc

The tests come up with a Element not visible no method error, even when the main menu item is selected, therefore exposing the sub menu items, Selenium complains and says the sub menu elements are not visible.

This only happens in I.E. but I have no choice but to use I.E. as that's the browser the business officially supports.

I noticed that there's quite a bit of Yui code in the HTML and began to wonder if there's a driver that can be used with Ruby (pure NOT rails) with my framework, to interact with the Yui driven menu items.

Any suggestions would be cool.

Thanks,

I have a bunch of user acceptance tests written in Gherkin(Cucumber) which use Capybara to driver these tests in Internet explorer, the tests always fail when interacting with the sub-menu options, ie, sub menus can't be interacted with.

Users log on and create a request. The request contains details of the car that would be sent in as well as an assumption on the customers part on what the problem might be.

    ID | DETAILS
    
    REQUEST
    ID|CUSTOMERID|DETAILS
    
    CAR_TROUBLE_REQUEST

I took a look at this post (which is a bit dated so I was hoping for some modern input):

The two frameworks I have looked at are [FXRuby][2] and [Ruby-GTK2][3] and I was hoping someone could give some pros and cons to these frameworks or perhaps a recommendation of a GUI framework for Ruby.

Oh and if you do think Shoes is the way to go, please mention that as well.

I'm using the Thor::Actions `directory` command to build the app entirely from a template directory structure, as opposed to defining them inline with heredocs. The script directory looks something like this:

    rubynu.thor
    template/
      bin/
      lib/
        %app_name%.rb.tt
        %app_name%
      README.markdown
      .gitignore
      ...

This works really great, and lets me easily visualize and change individual parts of the template as my taste changes. 

But I can't figure out a nice way to get thor to find the template directory once the .thor file is system installed using `thor install rubynu.thor`. Install sticks a copy of the .thor file into ~/.thor but ignores the template/ directory, and so the templates aren't found anymore. 

I don't want to hardcode the source_root path or manually copy over the template directory to ~/.thor. Is there something built-in to thor that handles installing templates along with the .thor file? It would be great if they could be packaged together when installed. 

If not, what is the nicest way to get around this? Surely there are system installed thor tasks somewhere that use template files. How'd you do it? I suppose I could bypass thor install and provide this as a gem (though that seems like overkill), or bite the bullet and stick all the template definitions inline in a giant .thor file (less pleasant to make changes to the structure later).

For reference, here is the simple .thor file I'm using:

    class Rubynu < Thor::Group
      include Thor::Actions
        
      argument :app_name

When it comes time to release the next version of VCR, I'm not sure of the best way to handle these dependencies.  VCR will depend on either WebMock, or FakeWeb (but doesn't need both), and will have certain version requirements for both.  I could add both as dependencies to my gemspec, but when you use [bundler][5], it bundles all gem dependencies--so both FakeWeb *and* Webmock will get bundled with the application.

It is too flexible,I can not find any rule when I try to write the ruby code. For example the iterator in ruby. And too flexible means too many choices,but sometime too many choices is not a good idea.

I installed Neo4j and started it via `bin/neo4j start`.

In the next steps I wrote a ruby script that creates new nodes, after installing jruby and the neo4j gem. Everything fine until here.

My Problem: When the server is started and I try to creates nodes, Neo4j responds that the database is locked. When I stop the server the nodes get created.

I am used to relational databases, so I don´t understand this behaviour.

When I check the Server Info via the Neo4j Webadmin Tool (`http://localhost:7474/webadmin`) the ReadOnly flag is set to false.

It seems to me that the Neo4j approach is maybe different from relational db, meaning the server could maybe have a slightly other purpose then a db server.

My solution was trying to access `http://www.facebook.com/USER` and check the http headers (200 = OK; 404 = NOT FOUND). I could use this code:

    require 'open-uri'
    require 'net/http'

      url = URI.parse(url)

        return http.head(url.request_uri).code == httpcode
      end
    end

The problem is that Facebook always returns 302 (Found), then redirects to `https://www.facebook.com/USER`.

I can require `net/https` and create a new function:


    def https_url_exists? (url,httpcode)
      url = URI.parse(url)
      net = Net::HTTP.new(url.host, url.port) 
      net.use_ssl = true

      net.start do |http|
        return (http.head(url.request_uri).code == httpcode)
      end
    end

Now the problem is that some users use dots on their usernames. For example, username might be user.name. Facebook use redirections for this.

The problem is that Facebook always returns 302 (Found), then redirects to `https://www.facebook.com/USER`.

I can require `net/https` and create a new function:


    def https_url_exists? (url,httpcode)
      url = URI.parse(url)
      net = Net::HTTP.new(url.host, url.port) 
      net.use_ssl = true
      net.verify_mode = OpenSSL::SSL::VERIFY_NONE
      net.start do |http|
        return (http.head(url.request_uri).code == httpcode)
      end
    end

Now the problem is that some users use dots on their usernames. For example, username might be user.name. Facebook use redirections for this.

**What's the best way to check if USERNAME exists on facebook? How to get USER.NAME if USERNAME redirects to it?**",5

7890409,10/25/2011 13:57:49,2576,08/23/2008 01:57:10,1140,36,How to configure RubyMine to preserve Ruby 1.9.2 hash syntax when transforming code?,"RubyMine can toggle block syntax between `do;end` and `{ }` block notation. For example, given the following code:

    [1, 2, 3].each do |i|
      puts i
    end

I can place the caret at `do` and press Option-Enter Enter (on the Mac) to convert this code snippet to:

    [1, 2, 3].each { |i| puts i }

Doing the same with the caret at the `{` performs the reverse transformation.

However when the code inside the block contains Ruby 1.9.2's new hash syntax, RubyMine destroys it during the transformation:

    # before
    [1, 2, 3].each { |i| some_func(param: i) }

    # after
    [1, 2, 3].each do |i|
      some_func(param : i)
    end

RubyMine can toggle block syntax between `do;end` and `{ }` block notation. For example, given the following code:

    [1, 2, 3].each do |i|
      puts i
    end

I can place the caret at `do` and press Option-Enter Enter (on the Mac) to convert this code snippet to:

    [1, 2, 3].each { |i| puts i }

Doing the same with the caret at the `{` performs the reverse transformation.

However when the code inside the block contains Ruby 1.9.2's new hash syntax, RubyMine destroys it during the transformation:

    # before
    [1, 2, 3].each { |i| some_func(param: i) }

    # after
    [1, 2, 3].each do |i|

However, it seems that everywhere I go, people are using vim for their programming needs.

I know the basics of vim; it's my main ""basic text editor"" when I'm on a linux machine; I use it like I'd use the basic Notepad on Windows.  I get the controls, most of the shortcuts, the repetition eliminators, etc.

What I'm not quite understanding are these killer apps that people are espousing about.  How ""debugging Ruby in vim was a life-changing experience"", or how, when using it, magic occurs.

Am I missing some essential plug-ins?  Is there a dimension I'm not seeing?  Should I just shut up and start using it for a bit, to see?  How do I get syntax highlighting?

I'm specifying Ruby specifically because I'd like to find some plugins for it.  Note that I am **not** using Rails, and answers should be rails-independent of possible.  But I *would* appreciate some general vim-ness koans about programming in other languages, as well.

Thank you, and I hope my question isn't too vague or inspires any nasty editor wars.",5

Can someone provide 2 or 3 simple arithmetic or string examples to make this point clear, like if its about the syntaxes or logics etc.

Thanks..",3

### Goal ###

My ultimate goal is to make a Rake setup script to setup my rvm environment stuff (I need to dynamically create gemsets, install gems to those gemsets, and run ruby scripts within those gemsets). 

### Problem ###

I need to setup rvm in the shell that I'm executing rvm commands in. The basic idea is to source the rvm scripts [as outlined here](https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/rvm/basics/). 

The problem arises when I try and source the rvm script when executing a shell command within ruby. Its well documented that rvm only supports bash, but ruby doesn't seem to be using bash when executing shell commands.

### What I've Tried ###

I've tried all the methods to execute shell commands listed [here](http://tech.natemurray.com/2007/03/ruby-shell-commands.html) to no avail. I'll use the 'exec' method below for simplicity.

It seems that although ruby thinks its using the bash shell to execute these commands ... it is not. Observe!

    exec 'echo $SHELL'
    => /bin/bash

But

    exec 'source ~/.rvm/scripts/rvm; type rvm | head -1;'
    => sh: source: not found
    => rvm is ~/.rvm/bin/rvm

Which tells me that ruby is really using /bin/sh not /bin/bash (that output should return `rvm is a function`). I even went so far as to print the ruby env stuff, and ENV[SHELL] is '/bin/bash'


### 'Brute Force' Solution ###

I do have a workaround, but its really kludgy (this would necessitate that I 'AND' all of the commands together):

    exec 'echo \'source ~/.rvm/scripts/rvm && type rvm | head -1\' | /bin/bash'


I'd like to avoid using shell scripts if possible -- it seems reasonable that I can accomplish this within ruby.

125467,09/24/2008 04:50:42,14530,09/17/2008 00:44:16,117,30,Best Way to Conditional Redirect?,"Using Rails v2.1, lets say you have an action for a controller that is accessible from more than one location.  For example, within the Rails app, you have a link to edit a user from two different views, one on the users index view, and another from another view (lets say from the nav bar on every page).

I'm wondering what is the best way to redirect the user back to the right spot depending on what link they clicked on.  For example:

Example 1:

 1. List all users
 2. Click ""edit"" on a user in the list
 3. User clicks ""save"" on the form, the controller redirects back to 1.

Example 2:

 1. The user could be on any page within the application, the nav bar shows a link to edit the current user
 2. The user clicks on the link to edit
 3. The user clicks ""save"" on the form, controller redirects back to whatever page they were on when the user clicked the ""edit"" link in the nav bar.

I've seen it done in the past by:

 1. Placing a parameter on the original edit link with the original controller/action in which the link appeared. To make this more DRY, you could use @controller.controller\_name and @controller.action\_name in a helper.
 2. The controller saves the parameters to a session variable.
 3. Once the controller has saved the record, it redirects to the session variable.

What I don't particularly like about this solution is the need to add the parameter to every applicable link in the views.  I'm wondering if there's a way to build this all into the controller.

One better way I was thinking was to:

 1. Place a before_filter on the ""edit"" action to save the referrer (is this reliable enough?) into the session.
 2. When ""update"" is hit, the controller will redirect to the session variable and then delete the session variable.
