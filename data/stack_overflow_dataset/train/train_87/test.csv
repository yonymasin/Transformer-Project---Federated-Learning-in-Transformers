It also make sense as this gives the hint.

Now I want user to be able to print this panel (I asked how to do it [on this question][1]), but before printing, user must be presented with a new form, containing copy of pnlMain. On this form user has to do some changes, add few components and then print his customized copy of pnlMain. After printing user will close this form and return to original form with original pnlMain. And – as you can guess – original pnlMain must remain intact.

So is there any clever way to copy whole TPanel and it’s contents? I know I can make it manually iterating through pnlMain.Controls list.

What could be causing this? It's definitely not changing the `Checked` property anywhere in my code. There must be some strange behavior coming from the checkboxes themselves when placed in a grid.

**EDIT**

I did a brief test, I placed a regular `TCheckBox` on the form. Check/unchecks fine. Then, in my form's `OnShow` event, I changed the Checkbox's `Parent` to this grid. This time, it reacts the same, not changing when clicked. Therefore, it seems that a `TCheckBox` doesn't react properly when it has another control as its parent. How to overcome this?

I  am currently working on a project which uses a tree of TPersistent descendants to define, store and retrieve data. The top of this tree is a descendant of TComponent. It has a published property which is a descendant of TCollection. Here's a simplification of the structure:

    TMyComponent = class(TComponent)
    private
      FMyCollection: TMyCollection;
    published
      property Items: TMyCollection read FMyCollection write FMyCollection;
    end;

    TMyCollection = class(TCollection)
    protected
      procedure SetItem(index: integer; val: TCompositeItem);
      function GetItem(index: integer): TCompositeItem;
    public
      property Items[index: integer]: TCompositeItem read GetItem write SetItem; default;
    end;

    TCompositeItem = class(TCollectionItem)
    private
      FMyCollection: TMyCollection;
    published
      property Items: TMyCollection read FMyCollection write FMyCollection;
    end;

There are at least a dozen descendants of TCompositeItem. When you want to add a new item to the collection of one of the nodes in the tree you bring up the context menu and click ""Add Item"". This creates a new item which you must then further define as one one of the numerous descendants of TCompositeItem using the Object Inspector.

This works relatively well. The problem is that changes to the tree in the designer are not reflected in the associated source file. To get around this my predecessor added some synchronization code that recreates declarations in the .pas file from the tree in the .dfm. To properly synchronize everything you have to save your changes in the dfm, then double-click the component on the form (which triggers the synchronization code), then save again. Additionally you can only do one synchronization per editing session otherwise you get a prompt telling you to close the form, reopen it, then do the synchronization. If you forget to follow this procedure all kinds of strange behaviors occur at run time. Its kind of awkward but it works.

What I would like to do is have changes in the designer automatically updated in the cached source file then saved as normal when the developer clicks save, eliminating the need for the awkward three step synchronization.

This is how normal controls work so I'm not really sure why it doesn't work with this one. I have a gut feeling that the reason may be related to the ultimate class for each item in a collection not being determined until after it is created in the designer.
