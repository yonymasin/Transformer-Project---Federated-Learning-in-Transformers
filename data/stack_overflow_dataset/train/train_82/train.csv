I'm assuming that the vessel is only for deployment, but how do I actually deploy a vessel to a web server (say I'm using linux, apache and just running straight cgi).

Is Shipwright the right thing for what I'm trying to accomplish or is there something else that would be more appropriate? Ideally I could use Shipwright similar to how I use Buildout. I use Buildout to create a nice isolated environment for my development, and also I use Buildout when deploying to live servers to manage all of my application's dependencies.

This script will interface with Qualys so while looking up information about the Qualys API I found this statement while looking through their sample code.  I have put it on Pastebin.com ([here][1]) so you don't have to download it to view it. If for some reason you do want to download it yourself, [here][2] is a link to the page where I got it for those that want to be able to download the source (it's the ""Get Map"" one).

Anyways, here is the statement (line 261) that has me a little confused:

    $request = new HTTP::Request GET => $url;

I'm confused about the `new` and `GET => $url` parts of the statement.

 1. I think I mostly understand what's going on with the `new` part of the statement, but if someone could explain how the `HTTP::Request` works with creating a new `LWP::UserAgent` that would help clarify this line (I looked at LWP::UserAgent on CPAN, but the ""KEY/DEFAULT"" table they have under the `new` subroutine explanation made little sense to me).
 2. I really have no idea what is happening in the `GET => $url` part of the statement.  My guess is that it is assigning a value in either `HTTP::Request` or `LWP::UserAgent` but I can't find any information to back  up that idea.

now i want to change my scripting interface to lua - and i have all these perl scripts - i could write a manual parser based upon regexp etc to get a good conversation rate i believe - however i would prefer a smart solution which would make it impossible to have conversation errors between the languages (different datatypes, language syntax keywords etc)

I have a Perl program that reads in a bunch of data, munges it, and then outputs several different file formats.

I'd like to make Perl be one of those formats (in the form of a .pm package) and allow people to use the munged data within their own Perl scripts.

Printing out the data is easy, using Data::Dump::pp

I'd also like to print some helper functions to the resulting package.

What's an easy way to print a multi-line string ***without*** variable substitution?

I'd like to be able to do:

    print <<EOL;
      sub xyz { 
        my $var = shift;
      }
    EOL

But then I'd have to escape all of the $'s.

Is there a simple way to do this? Perhaps I can create an actual sub and have some magic pretty-printer print the contents? The printed code doesn't have to match the input or even be legible.

By running the above program, I am getting the following output
Can't create semaphore
Can't open semaphore

The output shows that its failed to create a semaphore and even failed to open semaphore.
creating a semaphore might have failed if a semaphore already exists with the given name.
I don't understand why opening a semaphore failed.

Can some clarify the scenario where both creating semaphore & opening semaphore fails.

    1;",perl,parse-recdescent,,,,,open,0,1880,3,"Parse::RecDescent performance issue I'm using Parse::RecDescent to parse lines in a Cisco IOS ACL.  The ACL is used on the edge router of a large network, so it contains almost 8k lines which are set by the government.  I'm looping through each of those lines and putting the values into a hash.  Although it is 8k lines I'm still spending over 14 seconds parsing the lines?  Does this sound reasonable?  It seems VERY slow to me.  Is there some overhead to using a hash verse another data structure?  Here is my entire parser:

Can I dynamically redefine perl methods?

Say I have a class like this one

    package MyClass;
    sub new {

      my $val = shift;
      my $self = { val=> $val};

      my $self = shift;
      return $self->{val}+10;
    }

And let's say that adding two numbers is really expensive.

I'd like to modify the class so that $val+10 is only computed the first time I call the method on that object. Subsequent calls to the method would return a cached value.

I could easily modify the method to include caching, but:

 - I have a bunch of methods like this.
 - I'd rather not dirty up this method.

What I really want to do is specify a list of methods that I know always return the same value for a given instance. I then want to take this list and pass it to a function to add caching support to those methods

Is there an effective way to accomplish this?

I tried some setgid/setuid perl-scripts, but they can't run scp in user X rights and they don't use it's rsa-key either. Something like this example:

The script works, but in my opinion, it's clumsy and probably non-efficient. The script is also inherited code, which I have modified a little to make it more readable. Still, it's a mess.

At the moment, the script reads the datafile(~4Mb) and puts it into array. Then it loops through array parsing its content and pushing values to another array and finally printing them to file in another for loop. If value is not found for certain point, then it prints 9999. Zero is an acceptable value.

The datafile has 5 different parameters and each of them is written to its own file.

Example of data:

    data for the param: 2
    5559
    // (x,y) count values
    280 40 3  0 0 0 
    280 41 4  0 0 0 0

**5559** is the number of data lines to current parameter. Data line goes: **x**, **y**, **number of consecutive values** for that particular point and finally the **values**.
There is an empty line between parameters.

This is not the real code. Just an example. It was working fine when I am calling this from another shell script. But not working when calling from a Perl script.The dynamic varible creating problem. I would like to know is it possible or do I have to change my code completely.(Before changing the code I wanted to confirm from the Perl Gurus)

If possible can anybody please help me on the same.

    sleep(5);
    close($sock);

So, my Bot does connect, and can talk to me...

If I start the shell Script manually, only one word (the string inside $user, not even the following colon) is sent.

If the script is invoked by SVN trough a commit, is seems like the $user and $commit strings are empty, $user and $repos are transmitted...

I guess that something is wrong with my usage of whoami and svnlook... But I can't figure it out. Maybe someone can give me a hint?",5

However I have problem, that I'm not sure what to do.

My idea is to try nginx, and I'm stuck with perl.

What I have alrady installed is:
- GeoIP
- gd
- perl
- perl-CPAN 
- libxslt 
- openssl 
- openssl098e

all from this rpm

    http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/5/x86_64/epel-release-5-4.noarch.rpm

That was all nginx asked for.
Now when I try 

    yum install ngnix

I get this error

    Resolving Dependencies
    --> Running transaction check
    ---> Package nginx.x86_64 0:0.8.55-1.el5 set to be updated
    --> Processing Dependency: perl(:MODULE_COMPAT_5.8.8) for package: nginx-0.8.55-1.el5.x86_64

    Error: Package: nginx-0.8.55-1.el5.x86_64 (epel)
               Requires: perl(:MODULE_COMPAT_5.8.8)
     You could try using --skip-broken to work around the problem
     You could try running: rpm -Va --nofiles --nodigest

Next thing I tried is to check perl version

    perl -v

I get this:

    This is perl, v5.10.1 (*) built for x86_64-linux-thread-multi

And for 

    rpm -q --provides perl | grep MODULE_COMPAT

    foreach $s (keys @{ $data->{'settings'}->{'s'} }) {

Without any success:
    
    Type of arg 1 to keys must be hash (not array dereference) 

I can print:

For each setting, but I can't loop through them.

    $VAR1 = {
          'settings' => {
                          'user' => 'anonymous',
                          's' => [
                                   {
                                     'n' => 'blabla1',
                                     'v' => 'true'
                                   },
                                   {
                                     'n' => 'blabla2',
                                     'v' => 'false'
                                   },
                                   {
                                     'n' => 'blabla3',
                                     'v' => 'true'
                                   }
                                 ]
                        },
          'result' => '0'
        };

And here's my code

     $xml = new XML::Simple;
     $data = $xml->XMLin($file);
     foreach $s (keys %{ $data->{'settings'}->{'s'} }) {
      print ""TEST: $s $data->{'settings'}->{'s'}->[$s]->{'n'} $data->{'settings'}->{'s'}->[$s]->{'v'}<br>\n"";
     }

And it returns these 2 lines, without looping:

    TEST: n blabla1 true
    TEST: v blabla1 true

I also tried to do something like this:

    foreach $s (keys @{ $data->{'settings'}->{'s'} }) {

Without any success:
    
    Type of arg 1 to keys must be hash (not array dereference) 

I can print:

    $data->{'settings'}->{'s'}->[1]->{'n'} $data->{'settings'}->{'s'}->[1]->{'v'}

For each setting, but I can't loop through them.

How can I procede? What am I doing wrong?

Thanks a lot!",3

I have to generate a table (HTML) of what amounts to links to specific database records.  The records span many database tables.  This table (HTML) should behave like a menu within the already defined wrapper template.  Clicking an element of this 'menu table' should load a page with the 'menu table' as well as the selected record contents below it (either for viewing or as a form for editing).

My thought is to use chained actions/methods to produce the content (straight forward enough).  Then use a single template (template toolkit) to determine if we display only the 'menu table, or the 'menu table' and a view of the selected record, or the 'menu table' and a form to edit the selected record.  So for example, the template would always produce the 'menu table', but depending on if it is being used by a FormFu action/method, it may or may not produce the form for editing the selected record.  So the template would have conditional code for displaying or editing records.

It almost feels like a template within a template type solution is required.  Can someone with Catalyst experience shed some light?  Maybe comment on whether or not I'm headed in the right direction?

All I can rely on are Perl's core functions and even some of those are restricted, but I do appear to have access to sockets, fork, signals and the like.

I have so far managed to create a simple client and server (the server is just for testing) that can send and receive data. The problem is I want to set a timeout on the whole `get` operation like in LWP, but my initial attempts have been fruitless. The following does not work and I don't believe it can work, but I will post it just in case it can be fixed:

    sub grab {
    	my($addr, $port, $timeout) = @_;
    	my $it;
    
    	eval {
    	    local $SIG{ALRM} = sub {
    		die ""alarm\n"";
    	    };
    
    	    alarm $timeout if $timeout;
    
    	    my $iaddr = inet_aton($addr)
    		or die ""client no host: $!"";
    	    my $paddr = sockaddr_in($port, $iaddr)
    		or die ""client sockaddr_in: $!"";
    	    my $proto = getprotobyname(""tcp"");
    
    	    socket(Client, PF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, $proto)
    		or die ""Client socket: $!"";
    
    	    local $SIG{ALRM} = sub {
    		close(Client);
    		die ""alarm\n"";
    	    };
    
    	    connect(Client, $paddr)
    		or die ""Client connect: $!"";
    	    while(my $line = <Client>){
    		$it .= $line;
    	    }

    	if($@){
    	    die unless $@ eq ""alarm\n"";
    	}
    
    	return $it;
    } 

The alarm signal seems to get ignored by the likes of connect, read and possibly some of the others. I resorted to reading the LWP source code after this failed to work - because I felt like I was barking up the wrong tree - and found the following, amongst other gems, in `strawberry/perl/vendor/lib/LWP/Protocol/http.pm`:

    sub sysread {
        my $self = shift;
        if (my $timeout = ${*$self}{io_socket_timeout}) {
    	die ""read timeout"" unless $self->can_read($timeout);
        }
        else {
    	# since we have made the socket non-blocking we
    	# use select to wait for some data to arrive
    	$self->can_read(undef) || die ""Assert"";
        }
        sysread($self, $_[0], $_[1], $_[2] || 0);
    }
    
    sub can_read {
        my($self, $timeout) = @_;
        my $fbits = '';
        vec($fbits, fileno($self), 1) = 1;
      SELECT:
        {
            my $before;
            $before = time if $timeout;
            my $nfound = select($fbits, undef, undef, $timeout);
            if ($nfound < 0) {
                if ($!{EINTR} || $!{EAGAIN}) {
                    # don't really think EAGAIN can happen here
                    if ($timeout) {
                        $timeout -= time - $before;
                        $timeout = 0 if $timeout < 0;

I have a script running under Apache 1.3, with Apache::PerlRun option of mod_perl. It uses the standard CGI.pm module. It's a regularly accessed script on a busy server, accessed over https.

> /script.pl?action=edit&id=47049

Which is then brought into Perl the usual way...

    my $action = $cgi->param(""action"");
    my $id = $cgi->param(""id"");

This has been working successfully for a couple of years. However we started getting support requests this week from our customers who were accessing this script and getting blank pages. We already had a line like the following that put the current URL into a form we use for customers to report an issue about a page...

    $cgi->url(-query => 1);

And when we view source of the page, the result of that command is the same URL, but with an entirely different query string.

> /script.pl?action=login&user=foo&password=bar

A query string that we recognise as being from a totally different script elsewhere on our system.

However crazy it sounds, it seems that when users are accessing a URL with a query string, the query string that the script is seeing is one from a previous request on another script. Of course the script can't handle that action and outputs nothing.

We have some automated test scripts running to see how often this happens, and it's not every time. To throw some extra confusion into the mix, after an Apache restart, the problem seems to initially disappear completely only to come back later. So whatever is causing it is somehow relieved by a restart, but we can't see how Apache can possibly take the request from one user and mix it up with another.

in the case I write our %Class ...; - it doesn't work, but if I write %My::Good::Class = ...; - it works. I don't understand it! In this case Class is a hash for My::Good package... or what?!

The purpose of this script is to report all unowned files and directories on a Unix system for audit compliance. The script has to accept a list of directories and files to exclude (either by full path or wildcard name), and must take as little processing power as possible. It is meant to be run on hundreds of Unix system that we (the company I work for) support, and has be able to run on all those Unix systems (multiple OS, multiple platforms: AIX, HP-UX, Solaris and Linux) without us having to install or upgrade anything first. In other words, it has to run with standard libraries and binaries we can expect on all systems.

If you want to test it on your system, simply create a test directory structure with generic files, chown the whole tree with a test user you create for this purpose, and then delete the user.

I am quite new to perl and cannot work out where they got their formatting from in the first place as there doesn't appear to be anything in the script.

I have also been googling global settings and environment variables, but I can't find any reference to anything that would do this?

So far I have managed to add number formatting manually but am still a bit bewildered by how to make my dates format correctly, but both these appears to have been done else where before..

Could anyone shine any light on this for me?

",perl,taint,suexec,suid,taint-checking,,open,0,1268,10,"taint-mode perl: preserve suid when running external program via system() I'm trying to add a feature to a legacy script. The script is suid, and uses perl -T (taint mode: man perlsec), for extra security. The feature I need to add is implemented in Python. 

My problem is that I can't convince perlsec to preserve the suid permissions, no matter how much I launder the environment and my command lines.

This is frustrating, since it preserves the suid for other binaries (such as /bin/id). Is there a undocumented special case for /usr/bin/perl? This seems unlikely.


Does anyone know a way to make this work? (**As-is**: We don't have the resources to re-architect this whole thing.)

Here's a cut-down version of my script, which still shows my problem.

I need to 1. accept a POST request -> 2. send it via POST to another url -> 3. get results -> 4. return results to the first POST request (4 steps).

To accept a POST request (step 1) I use the following peace of code (found it somewhere in the Internet):

	$ENV{'REQUEST_METHOD'} =~ tr/a-z/A-Z/;
	if ($ENV{'REQUEST_METHOD'} eq ""POST"") {
		read(STDIN, $buffer, $ENV{'CONTENT_LENGTH'});

		$value =~ tr/+/ /;
		$value =~ s/%(..)/pack(""C"", hex($1))/eg;
		$FORM{$name} = $value;

The content of `$name` (it's a string) is the result of the first step. Now I need to send `$name` via POST request to some_url (step 2) which returns me another result (step 3), which I have to return as a result to the very first POST request (step 4).

    13|type|varchar(64)|1||0
    14|sense|char(256)|0||0

The fields of interest are `first_error` and `last_error`. These fields contain epoch time values. **Thus, they are 32-bit numbers, but they are less than 2147483647**

In my code, I have the following:

    my @entries =  $self->{row}->search_related_rs('eventlog_entries')
                               ->search_related('entry', {
                                 first_error => {'>', $range->{start}},
                                 last_error  => {'<', $range->{end}},
                               }
    		   )->all();

`start` is set to 0; `end` is set to `2**32 - 1`

When run with `DBI_TRACE=1`, I get:

    <- prepare_cached('SELECT entry.entry_key, entry.node, entry.object_type,
                       entry.object_id, entry.copy_id, entry.seq_number,

                       entry.type, entry.sense FROM eventlog_entry me  JOIN entry entry ON
                       entry.entry_key = me.entry_key WHERE ( ( ( first_error > ? AND
                         last_error < ? ) AND me.eventlog_key = ? ) )',

    <- fetchall_arrayref= ( [ ] ) [1 items] row-1 at Cursor.pm line 133

In this case, `@entries` is an empty array.

On the other hand, if I set `end` is set to `2**31 - 1`, everything works.

My hyopthesis is this:

SQLite fields have an 'affinity', which means that the fields are recognised as integers, but they have no native size. Thus, SQLite ""guesses"" what the size is, based on the contents of the field. Since the value in the `last_error` field is less than 2147483647, but greater than 16777215, I'm guessing that SQLite is treating the field as a SIGNED INTEGER (i.e. signed 32-bit number).

As such, my guess is that, when the `bind_param` takes place, some kind of inspection is done, which results in DBI identifying `last_error` as a SIGNED INTEGER. As a result, the value of 4294967295 overflows, or gets squished to zero, or something like that, and the comparison works incorrectly.

Thus, my question(s):

 1. Is this hypothesis correct (according to some documentation that I've overlooked)? or
 2. Is there a way to confirm this hypothesis?
 3. Is this a bug, or is there a sensible workaround, bearing in mind that I'm using DBIx::Class, so I'm somewhat abstracted away from the database.

functions. Right now my general strategy is to substitute the error from a C
function with `PL_sv_undef` and the calling Perl code has to check explicitly
whether the return is not `undef`. (For some C functions it is more complicated
as I convert their output into a `HV`/`AV` and use empty list to report the error.)

Now as I moved to writing bigger Perl scripts using that library, I want to
simplify the error handling and use e.g. the usual `eval {}`/`die` exception-like
mechanism to handle errors.

At the moment a simple XSUB in my XS look like that:

    SV *
    simple_function( param1, param2 = 0, param3 = 0)
            int             param1
            int             param2
            int             param3
            CODE:
                    int rc;
                    rc = simple_function( param1, param2, param3 );
                    RETVAL = (rc == 0) ? &PL_sv_yes : &PL_sv_undef;
            OUTPUT:
                    RETVAL

I have seen that some modules have global flag like ""RaiseError"" to `die` on
errors but failed to find any example I can borrow from. The few modules I have
found handle the ""RaiseError"" flag inside the `.pm`, not inside the `.xs`, and
thus allowed to use the Perl's `die`. In my case that is rather hard to
implement inside the `.pm` as many functions require special error checks. That
would also lead to code duplication as the checks are already present inside the XS.

I found nothing relevant in the [`perlxs`][1]/[`perlguts`][2] documentation. In particular, I have seen calls to `Perl_croak()` in the `.c` generated from my `.xs`, but failed to locate any documentation for the function.

What is the XS' analog of the Perl's `die`? Or how else can the XSUB report to Perl
run-time that the function has failed and there is no RETVAL to return? How to properly set the `$@`?

  [2]: http://perldoc.perl.org/perlguts.html",perl,xs,perl-xs,,,,open,0,467,5,"How can Perl's XSUB die? I have written a Perl XS wrapper for a C library consisting of about ~80
functions. Right now my general strategy is to substitute the error from a C
function with `PL_sv_undef` and the calling Perl code has to check explicitly
whether the return is not `undef`. (For some C functions it is more complicated
as I convert their output into a `HV`/`AV` and use empty list to report the error.)

Now as I moved to writing bigger Perl scripts using that library, I want to
simplify the error handling and use e.g. the usual `eval {}`/`die` exception-like
mechanism to handle errors.

At the moment a simple XSUB in my XS look like that:

    SV *
    simple_function( param1, param2 = 0, param3 = 0)
            int             param1
            int             param2
            int             param3
            CODE:
                    int rc;
                    rc = simple_function( param1, param2, param3 );
                    RETVAL = (rc == 0) ? &PL_sv_yes : &PL_sv_undef;
            OUTPUT:
                    RETVAL

I have seen that some modules have global flag like ""RaiseError"" to `die` on
errors but failed to find any example I can borrow from. The few modules I have
found handle the ""RaiseError"" flag inside the `.pm`, not inside the `.xs`, and
thus allowed to use the Perl's `die`. In my case that is rather hard to
implement inside the `.pm` as many functions require special error checks. That
would also lead to code duplication as the checks are already present inside the XS.

I found nothing relevant in the [`perlxs`][1]/[`perlguts`][2] documentation. In particular, I have seen calls to `Perl_croak()` in the `.c` generated from my `.xs`, but failed to locate any documentation for the function.

What is the XS' analog of the Perl's `die`? Or how else can the XSUB report to Perl
run-time that the function has failed and there is no RETVAL to return? How to properly set the `$@`?

One problem I am running into is that I want to query records, filtering out records that aren't in a certain date range.

It took me a while to find out how to do a ""<="" type of match instead of an equality match:

    my $start_criteria = "">= $start_date"";
    my $end_criteria = ""<= $end_date"";
    my $result   = $schema->resultset('MyTable')->search(
      {
        'status_date' => \$start_criteria,
        'status_date' => \$end_criteria,
      });

The obvious problem with this is that since the filters are in a hash, I am overwriting the value for ""status_date"", and am only searching where the status_date <= $end_date.  The SQL that gets executed is:

    SELECT me.* from MyTable me where status_date <= '9999-12-31'

I've searched CPAN, Google and SO and haven't been able to figure out how to apply 2 conditions to the same column.  All documentation I've been able to find shows how to filter on more than 1 column, but not 2 conditions on the same column.

I'm sure I'm missing something obvious - hoping someone here can point it out to me?

Thanks in advance!

One problem I am running into is that I want to query records, filtering out records that aren't in a certain date range.

It took me a while to find out how to do a ""<="" type of match instead of an equality match:

    my $start_criteria = "">= $start_date"";
    my $end_criteria = ""<= $end_date"";
    my $result   = $schema->resultset('MyTable')->search(
      {
        'status_date' => \$start_criteria,
        'status_date' => \$end_criteria,
      });

The obvious problem with this is that since the filters are in a hash, I am overwriting the value for ""status_date"", and am only searching where the status_date <= $end_date.  The SQL that gets executed is:

    SELECT me.* from MyTable me where status_date <= '9999-12-31'

I've searched CPAN, Google and SO and haven't been able to figure out how to apply 2 conditions to the same column.  All documentation I've been able to find shows how to filter on more than 1 column, but not 2 conditions on the same column.

I'm sure I'm missing something obvious - hoping someone here can point it out to me?

Thanks in advance!

**Script Goals**

1. Deal with gaps and duplicates in individual time series prior to ratio adjusted output.
2. Calculate ratio.
3. Trap open for symbolA and symbolB.
4. Create ratio adjusted time series CSV file based on one minute input data.
5. Batch process folders with x and y number of files and generate respective number of
 ratio adjusted CSV files.

**1. Clean and scrub:**   Clean and scrub all files prior to ratio adjusted output.   			

This should probably be its own script upon reflection. So as not to be cleaning
and scrubbing same files multiple times.
In the case of time gaps (959 1001), fill in 1000 with values values from 959. 	
In the case of time duplicates (1004 1004), read first time stamp, and throw out second.

**2. Calculate Ratio:**  The script will use a ratio created at the close of each day. 
 			
Calculate the ratio once at the beginning of processing day, or end of day yesterday, 
using yesterday's closing prices.  
The ratio remains constant for processing day. 			
One capturing mechanism is if date <> date one element back then store closeA = close one element back.
   
Example: The ratio will depend on which security's close was higher. 

ratio = (lower price symbol ) / (higher price symbol).

If symbolA is higher (symbolA * ratio) - symbolB.

If symbolB is higher symbolA - (symbolB * ratio).

**3. Trap Open:** 

Since each individual time series is based on composite exchange data I am uncertain of the time of open. 
I wish to define the open when both symbolA volume > volumeInpt and symbolB volume > volumeInput. volumeInput = 5000. 
Thus need to create a volume sum counter for symbolA and symbolB until both are open.

**4.	Create ratio adjusted time series for .csv output file.** 

Name file: CvxXom.csv Where CVX = symbolA and XOM = symbolB. 

The format for output files will be:  Date Time Open High Low Close.
 
Format Open High Low Close values by rounding to two decimal places. (example: 1.02)

Use the ratio to adjust the two input time series and output a merged ratio adjusted time series. Date and time are passed through.  
Open High Low and Close formula (close prices used for example) :

If symbolA > symbolB at the close of yesterday

Close of each interval = (close symbolA * ratio) - close symbolB. 

If symbolA < symbolB at the close of yesterday

Close of each interval = close symbolA - (close symbolB * ratio).

				
**5.	I wish to batch process and output multiple files.**  

Process and output all combinations of two folders with x and y number of time series files
respectively.  Sorting each folder alphabetically would be preferred.

**Notes for consideration:**

Open can vary between symbolA(932) and symbolB(934), only want to output when both are open. 	
	
Trap for possible errors that fall under clean and scrub category. 
 		
It is also possible that certain securities may not open on a given day, need to
throw out that day. 		

Don't process same symbol with same symbol.
 		
The time gap issue of 959 to 1001, fill in 1000. 959 + 1 = 960. Need to use hour based mathematics.

Thank you in advance for help on any of the points, your consideration and time.

Prefix

`----------`

7777777 -> PPPP

8888888 -> QQQQ

I dont want that Prefix and ----. so using sed i am removing those Prefix,---- and blank space. This gives output numberserieslookup.txt as

numberseries.txt

7777777,PPPP

8888888,QQQQ

3. Using numberseries.txt, removing first 2 digit of first field.

lookup.txt

77777,PPPP

88888,QQQQ

4.for loop is used to make different files as per 2nd field.

Filename will be PPPP.txt inside that file

Eg:

PPPP.txt

77777,PPPP

QQQQ.txt

88888,QQQQ

can any one help me to make perl for this?

For me, it just doesn't seem right. I'm asking on your opinion about it, as my feelings might be influenced by today's trends and the horrible syntax (coming from c/java background).
