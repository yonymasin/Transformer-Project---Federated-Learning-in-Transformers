This all is a great learning curve for me.

first of all - this is a great community and a very very nice place to be! I love this great place. Today, one last question regarding a parser... I am currently working on a  little parser.

i have had very good results with the first script! This was able to run great! 
It fetches the data from the page: http://192.68.214.70/km/asps/schulsuche.asp?q=n&a=20
(note 6142 records) - But note - the data are not separated, so the subequent work with the data is a bit difficult. 

it spits out the data like this:

    1 0401 Mädchenrealschule Marienburg, Abenberg, der Diözese Eichstätt Marienburg 1 91183  Abenberg   09178/509210  Realschulen  mrs-marienburg.homepage.t-online.de

But i need to separate the data: with Commas or someting like that! 

And i have a second script. This part can do the CSV-formate. i want to ombine it with the spider-logic. But first lets have a look at the first script: with the great spider-logic.

           }
        }  



But as this-above script-unfortunatley does not take care for the separators i have had to take care for a method, that does look for separators. In order to get the data (output) separated. 

So with the separation i am able to work with the data - and store it in a mysql-table.. or do something else...So here [below] are the bits - that work out the csv-formate Note - i want to put the code below into the code above - to combine the spider-logic of the above mentioned code with the logic of outputting the data in CSV-formate.
where to set in the code Question: can we identify this point to migrate the one into the other... !? 
That would be amazing... I hope i could make clear what i have in mind...!? Are we able to use the benefits of the both parts (/scripts ) migrating them into one? 

So the question is: where to set in with the CSV-Script into the script (above)

The thing is that i have had very good results with the first script! It fetches the data from the page: http://192.68.214.70/km/asps/schulsuche.asp?q=n&a=20
(note 6142 records) - But note - the data are not separated...!

And i have a second script. This part can do the CSV-formate. i want to combine it with the spider-logic.

where is the part to insert?  I look forward to any and all help.

if i have to be more precice - just let me know...

But as this-above script-unfortunatley does not take care for the separators i have had to take care for a method, that does look for separators. In order to get the data (output) separated. 

So with the separation i am able to work with the data - and store it in a mysql-table.. or do something else...So here [below] are the bits - that work out the csv-formate Note - i want to put the code below into the code above - to combine the spider-logic of the above mentioned code with the logic of outputting the data in CSV-formate.
where to set in the code Question: can we identify this point to migrate the one into the other... !? 
That would be amazing... I hope i could make clear what i have in mind...!? Are we able to use the benefits of the both parts (/scripts ) migrating them into one? 

So the question is: where to set in with the CSV-Script into the script (above)

I'm not a very experienced sys-admin, though I've slogged my way through a few basic things.  I know what apache is, and I can read-most-of but not generate-without-guide related .conf files.

I've got a perl script which I've tested from the command line and it works (outputs as desired.)

When I try to access said script from the browser, I get 404.

I've tried placing the script at:

* /Users/me/Sites/mydomain.com/htdocs/mycgi.pl
* /Users/me/Sites/mydomain.com/cgi-bin/mycgi.pl
* /Users/me/Sites/mydomain.com/htdocs/cgi-bin/mycgi.pl

and accessing it as:

* http://www.mydomain.com/mycgi.pl
* http://www.mydomain.com/cgi-bin/mycgi.pl

and all the various combinations, all to no avail (404.)

The script and its container directory have permissions 755.

So, what other steps am I missing?  Are there any good set-up guides?  I tried the MAMP-Pro manual, but it is filled with such information as ""the cancel button cancels the current operation"" and not really anything useful.  Google turned up several hits that all seem to talk about how to make this work on localhost, but I'm trying to serve this to the outside world.

Any hints?

When I try to access said script from the browser, I get 404.

I've tried placing the script at:

* /Users/me/Sites/mydomain.com/htdocs/mycgi.pl
* /Users/me/Sites/mydomain.com/cgi-bin/mycgi.pl
* /Users/me/Sites/mydomain.com/htdocs/cgi-bin/mycgi.pl

and accessing it as:

* http://www.mydomain.com/mycgi.pl
* http://www.mydomain.com/cgi-bin/mycgi.pl

and all the various combinations, all to no avail (404.)

The script and its container directory have permissions 755.

So, what other steps am I missing?  Are there any good set-up guides?  I tried the MAMP-Pro manual, but it is filled with such information as ""the cancel button cancels the current operation"" and not really anything useful.  Google turned up several hits that all seem to talk about how to make this work on localhost, but I'm trying to serve this to the outside world.

Any hints?

Thanks!

I have written a small shell script which will take a single argument.
with the help of that argument.

the file name format is `axeA10_<date_time_stamp>_<sequence_number>.DAT`
my script just takes all the files in the current directory and changes the sequence number.
so that i have the files with sequence numbers.
the need to write this script is that i dont have the files with the sequence number as some of the sequences are missing.

I know that `perl` can be more fast in doing this kind of tasks.And so i want to learn the same.
Can anyone convert this small shell script to `perl`.this would really boost my confidence in learning `perl`.Thanks in advance.Below is the script which works fine.
