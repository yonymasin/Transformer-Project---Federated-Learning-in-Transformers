I am not shure what the easiest way is. In old school ASP.NET I used [secureWebPages on codeproject][3]. To be honest I dont know exactly what this httpModule does: It just worked.

I guess it does a 302 redirect to a http url if a page is requested via https that only requires http. My first idea is to have an action filter like RequireSll but with  a rule that redirects to http if ""Request.IsSecure"". It only gets a bit awkward at the end.

the problem is i have a client that wants to create a websites based on a Common functionality, so let us call it Modules, so what i thought is to use MVC Contrib Portable Areas, which are great ideas to plug Modules, but i have a big problem, let us say i created a Blog module which will be implemented in a new site he want, now some users have unique requirements like one of them needs to add Gallery of pictures to each article, or List of references in each article.
 this would be easy in normal situation where you have one site to work on, so all what you have to do is 

 - add a new gallery table with Foreign key to the Blog table.
 - regenerate Linq2SQl code and update the Model.
 - add new form elements to the Create,Edit,Delete Views .
 - add the logic in the controller.

but in my situation it is complicated and time cumbersome because of 2 reasons

 -  if the new functionality is cool
   and client decide to implement it in
   all sites, then i have to repeat the
   work for each site. 
 - if the functionality is unique it will create inconsistency for me in future

that is why as first step to solve the problem i used Portable Areas to create Addons for each Module, now this will definitely ease my work by dragging 1 DLL for each new Module or Addon, but i have a little problem here, which

 - because the new Module or Addin is a
   Dll, how can i create such a
   functionality in My Admin panel to
   install the new Addon or find any new
   added Module/Addon dragged new DLLS
   to the Main Application 
 - What is best
   practice to create an installation
   procedure inside the Portable Area,
   like Update the DB, New Routes,etc..

Now to the biggest Problem which is specific to Module Addon :)
let us take back the Article Gallery Addon, if i follow the logic i have mentioned above by creating it as a Portable area, it would be easier to create a functionality in the Module Code to loop through all Installed Addons and list them in the CRUD Views, but because i isolated the Addon and don't want to manually update the Main Module Code for the Reasons Above there will be no way for doing CRUD operations for the new Addons in Sync with the main module because there is no Foreign Key Relation, again because as i said above it may be Optional, so   i thought of the following solution which i hope there would be a better one

First in  Installation Process i will create a Table for the Gallery Addon, but instead of creating a foreign Key relation i will create a manual Foreign Key which will get populated by Generating a Unique ID in the Main Module Controller when i create record by using the following  code then store it in ViewData and just pass it to the Addon Controller when i create the new Record, 

    private  string GenerateId()
     {
      long i = 1;
      foreach (byte b in Guid.NewGuid().ToByteArray())
      {
       i *= ((int)b + 1);
      }
      return string.Format(""{0:x}"", i - DateTime.Now.Ticks);
     }
    ViewData[""FK""] = GenerateId();

but here are my Concerns

 - Is this way feasible or just plain
   Stupid. 
 - is this technique will
   generate a truly unique key.

i am extremely sorry if my question is lame, but this is the best place to ask and i think many people would want to have such a functionality and hope someone will answer me
thanks in advanced.

The simple-minded part is that I've abstracted the values used in various partial views, all of which are user controls that share identical CSS layouts.

The not so simple part is a reasonably efficient and logical abstraction of a standard UI element as a sql table row. But putting that aside...

I know I'm going to use some super-models to hand to each page the pre-configged models for the partial views. But if they are pre-configged and pre-loaded, where to put them until called?

The part that makes me think I'm a little insane to go this way is the load time for what is essentially static data. But then again, SharePoint!

So (I think) why not load it all in application_start? Why not? I answer! Then I get to use IoC for something that google returns not one link to good information from even one smart person who has ever considered that it might be a sane idea.

The code is:

    public void ApplyChanges<TEntity>(TEntity root) where TEntity : class, IObjectWithState {
            // bind the entity back into the context
            dbContext.Set<TEntity>().Add(root);
            // throw exception if entity does not implement IObjectWithState
            CheckForEntitiesWithoutStateInterface(dbContext);

            foreach (var entry in dbContext.ChangeTracker.Entries<IObjectWithState>()) {
                IObjectWithState stateInfo = entry.Entity;
                if (stateInfo.State == RecordState.Modified) {
                    // revert the Modified state of the entity
                    entry.State = EntityState.Unchanged;
                    foreach (var property in stateInfo.ModifiedProperties) {
                        // mark only the desired fields as modified
                        entry.Property(property).IsModified = true;
                    }
                } else {
                    entry.State = ConvertState(stateInfo.State);
                }
            }
            dbContext.SaveChanges();
        }

The purpose of this method is to let the EF know only a predefined set of entity fields are ready for update in the next call of SaveChanges(). This is needed in order to workaround the entity works in ASP.NET MVC 3 as follows:

 - on initial page load: the Get action of the controller is loading the
   entity object and passing it as a parameter to the view.
   
 - The View generate controls for editing 2 of the fields of the entity,
   and holds the ID of the record in a hidden field.

 - When hitting [save] and posting the entity back to the controller all
   of the fields excepting the 3 preserved in the view comes with a null
   value. This is the default behavior of the MVC binding manager.

If i save the changes back to the database the update query will of course overwrite the non mapped fields with a sentence as follows:

    UPDATE non_mapped_field_1 = NULL, ..., mapped_field_1 = 'mapped_value_1', mapped_field_2 = 'mapped_value_2', ... non_mapped_field_n = NULL WHERE ID = mapped_field_3
This is the reason i'm trying to track the fields individually and update only those fields i'm interested in. before calling the custom method with ApplyChanges() i'm adding the list of fields i want to be included in the update to the IObjectWithState.ModifiedProperties list, in order to get a SQL statement as follows:

    UPDATE mapped_field_1 = 'mapped_value_1', mapped_field_2 = 'mapped_value_2' WHERE id = mapped_value_3

The problem is, when marking one of the fields as modified in ApplyChanges, i.e.:

    entry.Property(property).IsModified = true;

the system is throwing the following **exception**:

    {System.InvalidOperationException: Member 'IsModified' cannot be called for property 'NotifyCEDeadline' on entity of type 'User' because the property is not part of the Entity Data Model.

    at System.Data.Entity.Internal.InternalPropertyEntry.set_IsModified(Boolean value)

    ...

So the question is. There's a way to bypass this EF validation or let the context know of the existance of this system property (IsModified) that i'm trying to change?

Summary of the architeture:

 - EF Code first (annotation + Fluent API)
 - Oracle .NET EF Data provider (ODAC)
 - Context is injected to a cutom business context with nInject.MVC => this is the reason i customized the ApplyChanges() method from

    using (var context = new BreakAwayContext()){ 
        context.Set<TEntity>().Add(root);

    to a simple call to the already initialized dbcontext

 - Oracle Database is created manually i.e. without the help of EF, so no EF metadata tables are used.

So, now is there anything I could do to inject the ModelState object into the ModelStateWrapper class using the IoC? Or do I have to explicitly/manually instantiate the ModelStateWrapper in the controllers and pass in the ModelState as an argument?

Any ideas what's causing the rules to disappear when the new attribute is added?

Now in this switch statement I have some validation for my form. 

Now I noticed lots of my forms need the exact same validation stuff.

So now when I need to add more validation I make a new class that implements ""IDataErrorInfo "" add the extra valdation.

Then in the view I do something like this

    CoreValidation coreReg = new CoreValidation();
     try
                {
                    UpdateModel(coreReg, regForm.ToValueProvider());

I just don't like that fact I need to have 2 separate try catch statements that could keep growing. If I needed to say take ""core"" and ""More"" and add some more validation that can't go into either of these I am looking at another try catch.

I tried to go to the ""CoreValidation"" class and extract out the switch statement and the Properties and put it in a new class.

My plan was then to just call that class and the method with the swtich statement. So in the ""More"" validation class I would in this

                get 
                {

""UserName"" are all set to null.

Whilst this would work, I'm wondering if there is a better way to handle this sort of problem. Possibly that wouldn't require putting in checks for every single action across all controllers like this.

Index() and Foo(int id) actions and routings like these:

So urls like / and /123 work as they are supposed to do. However when url is /blahblah where blahblah is not valid action name  I get 

The parameters dictionary contains a null entry for parameter 'id' of non-nullable type 'System.Int32'

error which is normal of course because of Foo action gets int parameter instead of int?

The problem is I can't use int? because then both Index and Foo actions match / url, so there is additional unnecessary Foo call.

So the question is, is it possible to catch the exception above OR redirect all not valid urls like /blahblah to some other action.

I have read this short bit detailing three ways of dealing with the view model in MVC:

http://geekswithblogs.net/michelotti/archive/2009/10/25/asp.net-mvc-view-model-patterns.aspx

The gist of it seems to me that:

Method 1, pull an object out the database and use it as your view model. Quick and simple, but if you want data from multiple tables you're totally screwed (I can't think of a way around it without Method 2).

Method 2, create a class that has references to multiple objects, and use this as your view model. This way you can access everything you need. The article says that when views become complicated it breaks down due to impedance mismatch between domain/view model objects... I don't understand what this means. Googling impedance mismatch returned a lot of stuff, the gist of it being that you're representing database stuff using objects and stuff doesn't map across cleanly, but you'd presumably have this problem even with Method 1. Not sure what I am missing. Also seems to me that creating a class for each View to get the data you want isn't ideal from a maintenance point of view, not sure if you have a choice.

Method 3, I am still getting my head around it, but I don't quite understand why their checkbox example wouldn't work in method 2, if you added a bool addAdditional to your class that wasn't connected to the domain model.
Method 3 seems to say rather than return the domain stuff directly, just pull out the properties you specifically need, which I think is nicer but is gonna be harder to maintain since you'll need some big constructors that do `this.x = domain.x`, `this.y = domain.y` etc.

I don't understand the builder, specifically why the interface is used, but will keep working on it.

Last night I deployed my application on IIS 7 and frustratingly stumbled across a major show stopper. The problem is related to error handling in Ajax request. To begin with I have some edit screens which works on ajax request. Here is the what the ajax part of the Ajax edit screen looks like.



    @using (Ajax.BeginForm(""_CityEdit"", null, new AjaxOptions { HttpMethod = ""Post"", UpdateTargetId = ""content"", 
                                                                LoadingElementId=""imgSaveLoading"", OnFailure=""onError"",
                                                                OnSuccess = ""onSuccess"" }, new { id = ""frmCity"" })) {
        <img id=""imgSaveLoading"" alt=""loading"" src=""@Url.Content(""~/Content/Telerik/Vista/loading.gif"")"" class=""ajax-loader-user"" />
        <div class=""content"" id=""content"">
            @{Html.RenderPartial(""_CityEdit"");}   
        </div>
    
        <!-- Some Other code here -->
    }

I was relying on the ""onError"" callback of the above Ajax.BeginForm(). So in my controller, whenever I wanted to display error to user (model error or any other error), I just set the Server Response to 500 (Internal Server Error) optimistically hoping that this would result in ""OnError"" handler of Ajax.BeginForm() being invoked. Here is a snippet of how I did this in my controller.


    [HttpPost]
    public ActionResult _CityEdit(CityViewModel viewModel) {
        city = cityManager.FindCity(viewModel.City.Id, false);
        // Validate Model here 
        if (!TryUpdateModel(city, ""City"")) {
            Response.StatusCode = 500;
            return PartialView(""_CityEdit"", viewModel);
        }

As can be seen from above code, I returned PartialView and if it contained Model Errors, they will automatically get displayed on the Ajax Edit Screen. Then in the ""OnError"" javascript I just replace the related div with the PartialView returned by the controller something like this.

    function onError(xhr) {
        $('#content').html(xhr.responseText);
    }
 
This all worked great on my development machine. When I deployed my application on IIS 7 and accessed it from an windows XP box (with IE 8 or Chrome), instead of PartialView, the browsers just displayed the default ""500 Internal Server Error"" screen. So I have a few doubts that caused me not to sleep well last night.

1. Is the approach that I have used for ajax editing a reasonable one. If not what could be the other way(s) I could have handled Ajax Editing (with ability to display model errors).

2. Since I been developing these modules for some days now and have put up considerable effort, is there any worksaround to get it working on XP box. Basically, it would be ideal if I could somehow prevent browser from displaying their default ""500 Internal Server Error"" screen.

3. Is this approach working on windows 7, because I have IIS 7 installed on the same windows 7 machine that I am using to browse to site, or its just that it works well with windows 7.

If any other suggestions, please go ahead.

                    ""Default"", // Route name
                    ""{controller}/{action}/{id}"", // URL with parameters
                    new { controller = ""Home"", action = ""Index"", id = UrlParameter.Optional } // Parameter defaults
                );

I want that in a browser the url looks like:

    http://localhost:12981/Film/Overview/12

How can I do this?

One more example:
 

    http://localhost:12981/BaseEvent/EventOverview/15?type=Sport

should be

    http://localhost:12981/Sport/Overview/15

Let's say I have the following database table, Account:

    UserID int
    Email varchar(50)
    PasswordHash varchar(250)
    PasswordSalt varchar(250)

Of course, EF4 would build the entity like so:

    public class Account
    {
        public int UserID { get; set; }
        public string Email { get; set; }
        public string PasswordHash { get; set; }
        public string PasswordSalt { get; set; }
    }

Now, let's say I have a view model for registering a new user, which may look something like so:

    public class RegistrationViewModel
    {
        public string Email { get; set; }
        public string Password { get; set; }
    }

Lastly, I have a service which needs to register the user:

    public class RegistrationService
    {
        public void RegisterUser(??? registration)
        {
            // Do stuff to register user
        }
    }

I'm trying to figure out what to pass into the RegisterUser method.  The view model is, of course, located under my web app (presentation layer), so I do not want this getting passed to my service.  

**So, I'm thinking one of four possibilities:**

1) Set up a service model that is similar, if not identical, to the RegistrationViewModel, and use this:

    public class RegistrationServiceModel
    {
        public string Email { get; set; }
        public string Password { get; set; }
    }

    public class RegistrationService
    {
        public void RegisterUser(RegistrationServiceModel registration)
        {
            // Do stuff to register user
        }
    }

2) Set up an interface of the model, and inherit this in my view model, and set up my method to accept the interface:


    public interface IRegistrationModel
    {
        string Email;
        string Password;
    }

    public class RegistrationServiceModel : IRegistrationModel
    {
        public string Email { get; set; }
        public string Password { get; set; }
    }

    public class RegistrationService
    {
        public void RegisterUser(IRegistrationModel registration)
        {
            // Do stuff to register user
        }
    }

3) Pass in the Account entity, doing the RegistrationViewModel-to-Account mapping in my controller:

    public class RegistrationService
    {
        public void RegisterUser(Account account)
        {
            // Do stuff to register user
        }
    }

4) Move my view model out of the presentation into a domain/service layer, and pass that into the service method:

    public class RegistrationService
    {
        public void RegisterUser(RegistrationViewModel account)
        {
            // Do stuff to register user
        }
    }

Secondly, every form that posts will have the key/cookie combo.

My question is, what would be the easiest way to implement this in an ASP.NET MVC web application?

Not to answer my own question, but here are my initial thoughts:

Right now my controllers all inherit from a base controller, so my first thought was to override the OnActionExecuted method to check for the existence of the required form field, and from there if it finds it, verify it against the cookie and either allow the post to continue or kick it to some error page.

For the form portion I was thinking of generating my own html extension methods like...  Html.BeginSecureForm() that overloads all of the same methods as BeginForm (In case i need them) but auto generates the Pseudorandom key and cookie and places the cookie and the form field inside the form (IF ITS A POST!) automagically.

Sorry, if this is kind of jumbled up, I have notes scattered throughout these pages and I'm trying to organize them.  Part of that is to figure out my design for this XSRF security thing.

- /books  
- /clothes  
- /electronics

Currently, I have a books controller, and a sports controller, and an electronics controller

- /books/non-fiction/  
- /books/non-fiction/computing

Having some trouble figuring out the best way to map ""categories""

For each category, I have a root page - that will display some offers, info, etc..
(these are examples)

- /books  
- /clothes  
- /electronics

Currently, I have a books controller, and a sports controller, and an electronics controller

This seems a little ""clunky"" as if a new category is added, we have to create a controller for it..

In the product database, I have categories ""flattened"" in a hierarchy.

We currently have a number of views that enable/disable based on boolean flags (Model.IsNew is an example).  I'm of the opinion that views should be as simple as possible and controllers should determine the data for that view, not necessarily how it works.  I think views, partial or full, should be -told- what to do and handle that vs the view determining what should be shown/hidden.  A very basic example goes as follows but covers both sides of this and is mostly a reflection of what we have ...

A controller has a pair of methods (post/get) called Details.  [Get]Details has a single parameter, Id and [Post]Details takes id and a viewmodel.  Within the post, the method is ~30 lines long checking for valid model, determining if its new, if a certain value changed (triggers redirect) and so on (I think this is incorrect).  The [Get]Details check for empty id, populates the necessary dropdowns, nothing fancy (I think this is right).  The detail view itself contains a small bit of logic : If (!Model.IsNew) { RenderAction(History => History.Show(id); } (I think this within an if is incorrect, the Show should know what to display, regardless if its new).  The plus to this is the layout for said Detail view isn't done twice.  Details/Add would be nearly identical, minus some disabled fields depending on state (maybe these should be partials?) -- the entity could be disabled/deleted making the values editable or not.

Warning: this question is in-depth. :-)

Okay.
I've been working with ASP.NET for a little while now. Just a few days ago, after watching a course on MVC at [Pluralsight][1], i decided to try it out. Development was amazing and very easy, especially with the Entity Framework 4.1. As i searched around for deployment options, i found [AppHarbor][2].  Unfortunately, i ran into some problems. See, i can't just magically port my databases over with the git commit AppHarbor requires.  The problem is, I've never really worked with databases - they've always just worked [automagically][3]. I'm scared stiff of connection strings and the like. I managed to get a database set up on AppHarbor for the ASP.NET Membership stuff (I still need to figure out how to copy over the data and schemas, but i'll figure that out :-)) but i'm clueless on what to do about the Entity Framework SQL Server Compact database, which i'm using to store blog posts and comments. Problems:

 1. It's not working - MVC/EntityFramwork/Whatever-Is-Automagically-Working-Behind-The-Scenes isn't firing up a new database or whatever
 2. AppHarbor only allows 1 database (for the free version)

Potential Solutions?

 1. Combine the databases. I have no idea how to do this or how i would keep the EntityFramework's Auto-Magic working. 
 2. Adopt a non-database solution for the posts/comments. I realize databases are incredibly more efficient as there's a sort of interface between the literal file and the programs accesing it, so you don't have file locking and stuff. So what would be the best alternative? 

##My Question
What's the best way to handle this situation? Not just this particular situation, but the general situation of ""crap-i-hate-databases""? 

Ways to answer: 

 1. Recommending that i learn about databases: fine, but please provide some good resources.
 2. Giving a non-database alternative: awesome.
 3. Explaining what i need to do to get this all working on AppHarbor (but more generally any deploy server): ideal. I may even set up a bounty just to award it

2. I can create a new RedirectToAction object that checks if the headers have been sent (can't figure out how to do this -- try/catch?) and, if so, builds out a simple page with a meta redirect, a javascript redirect, and also a ""click here"" link.
3. Within my controller, I can remember if I've rendered an email and, if so, manually do #2 by displaying a view.
4. I can manually send the redirect headers before any potential email rendering. Then, rather than using the MVC infrastructure to redirecttoaction, I just call result.end. This seems easiest, but really messy.

Due to compatibility reasons the example User entity in the database contains field called ""Disabled"" which is the type of int with values 0 or 1 (to be mapped to bool).
In my edmx mappings this field is called 'disabled' and it's getter and setter are internal.
Then an additional partial class exposes this field as bool property 'Disabled' for in-code operations:

I've got an ASP.NET MVC app that have a page with multiple forms, each form has some text fields, an agreement checkbox and a submit button. I'd like to disable the submit button if the agreement checkbox isn't checked individually for each form. I've got it working but I get the feeling that I'm missing something elegant and I know there are people here far better at JQuery than I.

Here's the code I've got working:

        $(function() {
            $(""form"").each(function() {

           $(""#stlist"").load('@Url.Action(""KitsEdit"",""Spr"")' + '?id=' +  '@Model.sprid');


What is happening though is that it does the above but after it runs

        $(""#stlist"").load('@Url.Action(""KitsEdit"",""Spr"")' + '?id=' +  '@Model.sprid'); 

it again goes to 

        [HttpPost]
        public ActionResult EditTrain(Train editrain)

How can I prevent it from going to 

        [HttpPost]
        public ActionResult EditTrain(Train editrain) 
after the .load() as it already did it once when I needed it to do so.

I discovered the problem because some elements on the page were getting double-bound by jQuery. After some (ridiculous) debugging, I finally discovered that once the view is completely done rendering itself and all its children partial views, it goes back to an arbitrary yet consistent location and re-renders itself.

For lack of any better debugging idea, I've painstakingly added logging tracers throughout the HTML just so I can pin down what may be causing this. For instance, this code (`$log` just logs to the console):

Currently I have a ViewModel that I use to render my screen.  The View model actually contains the flattened data of several domain models.  I've decorated the ViewModel with attributes to do basic validation, but the real validation work happens at the service layer.  The problem occurs when there is a validation error at the service layer.  The name of the property (i.e. - UserName) doesn't match the entry in the ModelState (i.e. - RegistrationViewModel.UserName).

Does anyone have a recommendation for how to handle this?

Thanks in advance!

Basically, I have a site that is using a liberal dose of jquery to retrieve partialviews into a consolidated 'single view'. So far so good - it all works great and is very performant. 

However, I would like to have the ability to 'flag' (using a button) any such set and as a consequence of flagging it, add it to a functional area that I have dubbed 'active-tasks'. What I'd like to do is to be able to then goto that 'active-tasks' panel and see a range of ui tabs that represented the consolidated views that I had added. Clicking on any tab would then re-invoke that consolodated view afresh with the parameters that had been used at the time of flagging it. This would therefore mean that I'd have to store the parameters (?) for creating that consolidated view, rather than the generated html (this part i can do at the moment).

So, any thoughts on how to elegantly store the code required to generate the consolidated view on clicking a tab button - no pressure :)

I have created a textbox, like so:

When enabling clientside validation, *Name* is perfectly validated client side. 

However, if I create a ViewModel where User is now a property

then clientside validation fails. The form is posted without client validation picking up the error.

It looks like the javascript *window.mvcClientValidationMetadata* gets filled up as before, with no noticeable difference.

What gives? Is there something i need to do?
