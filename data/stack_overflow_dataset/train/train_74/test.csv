Basically, if the user doesn't do anything for 14 minutes, we prompt them that they will be logged out. If they click on ""keep me logged in"" we do an ajax request to keep their session alive, otherwise, they are redirected to the logout page after a minute.

It works pretty well, and is inline with similar systems employed at sites like mint.com and bankofamerica.com. The only problem is that our application's users tend to have multiple tabs open to refer back and forth to different pieces of data. So the problem is that they may be actively working in one tab, but then the other tab times out and logs them out. This causes an abrupt session timeout for the user when they were not expecting it. btw, mint.com has this same issue.

So I was wondering if anyone had any ideas to combat this?

I have one idea, each request could set a ""last active time"" cookie. Upon auto-logout, the server could check this last active time and if it's relatively recent, avoid logging them out. The manual logout would of course ignore this cookie so if the user wants to log out he can do so at any time. However, I'm afraid that this may be exposing some sort of security risk that I'm not able to see at this point. Thoughts?

Basically, if the user doesn't do anything for 14 minutes, we prompt them that they will be logged out. If they click on ""keep me logged in"" we do an ajax request to keep their session alive, otherwise, they are redirected to the logout page after a minute.

It works pretty well, and is inline with similar systems employed at sites like mint.com and bankofamerica.com. The only problem is that our application's users tend to have multiple tabs open to refer back and forth to different pieces of data. So the problem is that they may be actively working in one tab, but then the other tab times out and logs them out. This causes an abrupt session timeout for the user when they were not expecting it. btw, mint.com has this same issue.

So I was wondering if anyone had any ideas to combat this?

I have one idea, each request could set a ""last active time"" cookie. Upon auto-logout, the server could check this last active time and if it's relatively recent, avoid logging them out. The manual logout would of course ignore this cookie so if the user wants to log out he can do so at any time. However, I'm afraid that this may be exposing some sort of security risk that I'm not able to see at this point. Thoughts?

    Project project = new Project();
     project.ProjectType = selprojtype;

I've read through all the documentation, googled around, and i can't figure out how to set the `cache-control` header for the photos when i upload them.

I know you can do it with the REST API, but as i'm using the LitS3 library, that's not an option (unless i scrap the library altogether).

I did read and tried to implemented [this][1] and [this][2] and [that][3], but I failed completely :(

my route is like:

        ""{calurl}/{controller}/{action}/{id}"",
        new { calurl = ""none"", controller = ""Subscriber"", action = ""Index"", id = UrlParameter.Optional }

and I'm trying to use as

    ""{calurl}.domain.com"",
    ""{controller}/{action}/{id}""

so the routed value `calurl` would always come from the subdomain.

and I could have links like:

    http://demo.domain.com/Subscriber/Register

as of today I have

    http://domain.com/demo/Subscriber/Register

**What I have tried**


I tried to create my own `CustomRoute` using the example of the links above (all 3, one at a time), and I end up always screwing everything.

and I'm keep thinking that it's to much code just to change `RouteValue[""calurl""]` to the subdomain.

I did read and tried to implemented [this][1] and [this][2] and [that][3], but I failed completely :(

my route is like:

    routes.MapRoute(
        ""DefaultRoute"",
        ""{calurl}/{controller}/{action}/{id}"",
        new { calurl = ""none"", controller = ""Subscriber"", action = ""Index"", id = UrlParameter.Optional }
    );

and I'm trying to use as

    ""{calurl}.domain.com"",
    ""{controller}/{action}/{id}""

so the routed value `calurl` would always come from the subdomain.

and I could have links like:

    http://demo.domain.com/Subscriber/Register

as of today I have

    http://domain.com/demo/Subscriber/Register

***

**What I have tried**


I tried to create my own `CustomRoute` using the example of the links above (all 3, one at a time), and I end up always screwing everything.

and I'm keep thinking that it's to much code just to change `RouteValue[""calurl""]` to the subdomain.

I believe these issues are related to IgnoreRoutes, but I can't seem to craft an IgnoreRoute such that it resolves the problem.

**Problem:**

I am able to view my elmah error page (localhost/mvcapplication1/elmah.axd), however, the CSS is missing and none of the links work.

**Steps to Reproduce**

1) Create an ASP.NET MVC 1.0 Application

2) Add Elmah.  Download the assemblies, add them to your project and use the steps from [Elmah Setup Instructions][1]

3) Switch your application to 'Use Local IIS Web Server' from Property Pages --> Web

4) Add the wildcard mapping.  That is, open up IIS, go to properties --> Virtual directory --> Configuration --> Add:  Executable: C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727\aspnet_isapi.dll Extension: .* Limit To: GET, HEAD, POST, DEBUG Uncheck 'Check that file exists'.

5) Verify that `routes.IgnoreRoute(""{resource}.axd/{*pathInfo}"");` exists in the RegisterRoutes of your Global.aspx.  By the way, I have also tried `routes.IgnoreRoute(""elmah.axd"");`

Now.. run the app and bring up localhost/mvcapplication1/elmah.axd.

No CSS and links are broken.  

If I remove the wildcard mapping, all is fine, but then the application URL routing no longer works.  I understand that, but I should be able to pull up the elmah.axd with the proper IgnoreRoute scheme.

When I decide to create a strongly-typed View, inside the Add View dialog, the Model class dropdown does not show my ViewModel class. 

*For the record, yes I did compile the application before triggering the Add View dialog.*


I believe I have pinpointed the issue but do not know how to fix it.
Below are the repro-steps if anyone cares to reproduce the behavior:

 1. In Visual Studio 2010 (sp1), create a new C# asp.net MVC 4.0
    (beta) Internet Application.
 2. Inside the Models folder, create a new simple class called
    “GazouViewModel.cs”
 3. Build the application, open the HomeController, right-click the
    Index() ActionResult and select Add View…
 4. In the Add View dialog, check the “strongly-typed view” checkbox and
    in the Model class: dropdown, you’ll notice your “GazouViewModel”

----------------

 1. In Solution Explorer, right-click your project and select “Manage
    NuGet Packages”
 2. Search, find and install the “Bootstrapper.Autofac” package.
 3. Rebuild the application and verify if your “GazouViewModel” still
    displays inside the Add View dropdown’s dialog.
 4. The “GazouViewModel” should still be displaying in the dropdown.

----------------

 1. In Solution Explorer, right-click your project and select “Manage
    NuGet Packages”
 2. Search, find and install the “Autofac ASP.NET MVC4 (Beta)
    Integration” package.
 3. Rebuild the application and verify if your “GazouViewModel” still
    displays inside the Add View dropdown’s dialog.
 4. The “GazouViewModel” should still be displaying in the dropdown.

----------------

 1. In Solution Explorer, right-click your project and ADD a new class
    (Class1.cs) anywhere it doesn’t matter.
 2. Make that Class1 implement IAutofacRegistration and implement the
    interface.
 3. Rebuild the application and verify if your “GazouViewModel” still
    displays inside the Add View dropdown’s dialog.
 4. The “GazouViewModel” is no longer showing inside the Model class
    dropdown.

It appears that as soon as I create a class that implements the `IAutofacRegistration` interface and build the application, I’m no longer capable of viewing my ViewModels in that dropdown.

Can anyone confirm if they are getting the same results as me?
And more importantly, how can one fix this?

**IMPORTANT**: I have tried the exact same steps with an mvc 3.0 application and the exact same behavior occurs…so this is not relevant to the BETA version.
