I have the following scenario:
I have a Razor view with a ""@using(Html.BeginForm(....))"" statement at the top of the page. Inside the using statement I have a few textboxes, whose values get populated by the user, and a button.

At the click of that button, a telerik modal window (displaying a partial view of the same model as the initial view) pops up so that the user can populate some more fields. Inside the modal window there is a button that must submit the entire form, which it does, however after I debug my action, I notice that the model is missing the values which were entered in the popup (partial view).

My code for the telerik window resides inside the using statement and looks as follows:

                Html.Telerik().Window()
                    .Name(""AddEditScaleWindow"")
                    .Title(""Save Scale"")
                    .Content(@<text>@Html.Partial(""AddUpdateFeeScale"")</text>)
                    .Buttons(e => e.Close())
                    .Height(250)
                    .Width(350)

                    .Visible(false)
                    .Render();

I tried different methods of getting the window to post its values but to no avail.

If I view source, I can see that the window (partial view) is inside the form. If I do a network trace I can see that the values being posted are all values that were entered on the view, but none from the partial view.

Does anyone have any idea why the values inside the window don't get posted?

Thank you in advance.

Everything is working fine, but now I want to take it to the next step - I want to be able to combine information from these models into one view and filter out information to display.

Example : 

PersonID; PersonName; ManagerDepartment; HireDate;

ManagerID; ManagerName; ManagerDepartment

I can easily set up a Model, Controller, and View here to display and edit, etc...  But I want to create a view that displays Employees in his department whose hire date is after a given date or something.

I am coming from Silverlight and have a good idea of the MVVM pattern, but not how it fits into MVC3.

I would assume that I need to create a view model with linq queries and perform some sort of filtering but every question that I see asked has a different way of doing this.

Thanks in advance,

For instance I am building a large application with a very complicated database structure. I find myself building POCO's often that contain several other objects. 

Can you guys weigh in on whether using the Repository Pattern in a scenario like this is a good idea or not? What are pros and cons?

        public string Previous { get; set; }
        public virtual string Current { get; set; }
    }

    // subclass
    public class SQTextBox : SQControl
    {
        public SQTextBox()
        {
            this.Type = typeof(SQTextBox).Name;
        }
    }

    //subclass
    public class SQDropDown : SQControl
    {
        public SQDropDown()
        {
            this.Type = typeof(SQDropDown).Name;
        }

        public override string Current { get; set; }

    // collection container used as the Model for a view
    public class SQControlsCollection
    {
        public List<SQControl> Collection { get; set; }
        public SQControlsCollection()
        {
            Collection = new List<SQControl>();
        }

    }


I populate the Collection control with different subclasses of SQControl as required at runtime, and in EditorTemplates I have a separate view for each subclass. Using  Html.EditorFor on the collection items I can dynamically generate the form with the appropriate controls.

This all works fine.

The problem I have is that when I save the form, MVC binding cannot tell what subclass each item in the Collection was created with and instead bind them to instances of the base class SQControl.

This confuses the View engine as it cannot determine the proper views to load anymore and simply loads the default.

The current workaround I have is to save the ""Type"" of the subclass as a field in the model, and on postback, I copy the collection into a new container, re-creating each object with the proper subclass based on the information in the Type field.

    public static SQControlsCollection Copy(SQControlsCollection target)
        {
            SQControlsCollection newCol = new SQControlsCollection();

            foreach (SQControl control in target.Collection)
            {
                if (control.Type == ""SQTextBox"")
                {
                    newCol.Collection.Add(new SQTextBox { Current = control.Current, Previous = control.Previous, ID = control.ID, Question = control.Question });
                }
                else if (control.Type == ""SQDropDown"")
                {
                    newCol.Collection.Add(new SQDropDown { Current = control.Current, Previous = control.Previous, ID = control.ID, Question = control.Question });
                }
                ...


            }

            return newCol;
        }

So my Question is, is there any better way to maintain the type of items in a base-typed-collection between postbacks? I understand it's practice in MVC to have a typed view for each model, but I want to be able to build a view on the fly based on an XML document using reusable partial views.

The trouble is when binding an action filter (with a service injected by controller) to a corresponding attribute, I've been unable to figure out how to pass parameter/property values from the attribute to its bound filter. Below is the code, and below that my intended fake-code:

**Filter & Attribute**

    public class AuthorizationFilter : IAuthorizationFilter
    {
        private readonly IAuthorizationService _authorizationService;
        private readonly UserRoles _requiredRoles;   // Enum

        {
            _authorizationService = authorizationService;
            _requiredRoles = requiredRoles;
        }
        
        public void OnAuthorization(AuthorizationContext filterContext)
        {
            if (filterContext.HttpContext.Session == null)

            else {
                var authorized = _authorizationService.IsUserInRole((UserSessionInfoViewModel) filterContext.HttpContext.Session[""user""], _requiredRoles);

          .WhenControllerHas<RequireRolesAttribute>();
    kernel.BindFilter<AuthorizationFilter>(FilterScope.Action, 0)
          .WhenActionMethodHas<RequireRolesAttribute>();

This should make sure any controller/action decorated with [RolesRequired] is bound to the filter. So far so good. Now I want to declare via the attribute the roles (much like the stock AuthorizeAttribute) and pass those values onto the filter that actually does the authorization. 

**Intended/Fake Code:** 

    [RequireRoles(UserRoles.Author)]
    public ActionResult Index()
    {
        // blah
    }

**Specifically,**

What does it take to inform the AuthorizationFilter of the roles? Can the filter/ninject access the arguments passed to the attribute's constructor? Can the filter/ninject pull them from the attributes public property?

I thought that I may have missed some step in my implementation of this, however after doing an update in the Batch Editing example for a Product Name in the Telerik Example that I downloaded using the Northwind database, the underlying data tables also is not changed.

I have tried adding

    @Html.DisplayFor(modelItem => item.startDate.Value.ToShortDateString())

And

    DisplayFor(modelItem => item.startDate.HasValue ? item.startDate.Value.ToShortDateString(): """")



However, they both return the following error message at runtime

    Templates can be used only with field access, property access, single-dimension array index, or single-parameter custom indexer expressions.

I have looked at Darin Dimitrov’s answer here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4679352/converting-datetime-format-using-razor

However, I don’t have access to the startDate property in my ViewModel, my ViewModel returns an IList of FormEmployment objects which you can see above.

If anyone has any idea’s on how to remove the time from the date time property then I would be greatly appreciative.

Thanks.

Also, my startDate property is Nullable.

          }
          </table>

My problem is that the line

    @Html.DisplayFor(modelItem => item.startDate)

Returns a date like this **20/06/2012 00:00:00**, and I would like it to remove the time and just display the date, ie, **20/06/2012**.

I have tried adding

    @Html.DisplayFor(modelItem => item.startDate.Value.ToShortDateString())

And

    DisplayFor(modelItem => item.startDate.HasValue ? item.startDate.Value.ToShortDateString(): """")



However, they both return the following error message at runtime

    Templates can be used only with field access, property access, single-dimension array index, or single-parameter custom indexer expressions.

I have looked at Darin Dimitrov’s answer here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4679352/converting-datetime-format-using-razor

However, I don’t have access to the startDate property in my ViewModel, my ViewModel returns an IList of FormEmployment objects which you can see above.

If anyone has any idea’s on how to remove the time from the date time property then I would be greatly appreciative.

Thanks.

Also, my startDate property is Nullable.

            }

This work fine when I initially load the grid. Now I have lots of data on my page and i want to find a particular record so i type my query or string in the text box in the search text box. When i do that here are the controller methods being called.

1) Index (with query entered in the search box)
2) List (with query entered in the search box)
3) List (with query entered in the search box)

I dont know why it called the List method mutliple times. 
I also tried to change the Global.ascx routes with calling different method instead of index but that does not work. It still called the Index multiple times.

I would appreciate any help or ideas regarding this issue.

      }  

      public IEnumerable<SignedInAs> SignedInAsOptions { get; set; }  
    }

and the method, db.GetSignedInAsOptions() returns a List of SignedInAs objects with the properties, ID and Name.  

And in Views/Home/SignedInAs.cshtml, I have:  

    @model myMVCApp.Views.SignedInAsViewModel  
    ...  
    @Html.DropDownList(""ddlSignedInAs"", new SelectList(Model.SignedInAsOptions, ""ID"", ""Name"", selectedValue))
    ...

And the Select list renders exactly as expected on my page at /Home/SignedInAs.  
  
What I really want to do is render the DropDownList at the top of every page.  So, I created a partial view, _SignedInAsPartial:  
  
    @model myMVCApp.Views.SignedInAsViewModel
    @if (Request.IsAuthenticated)
    {	
      <text><div>@Html.DropDownList(""ddlSignedInAs"", new SelectList(Model.SignedInAsOptions, ""ID"", ""Name"", selectedValue))</div></text>

        return PartialView(siavm);
      }
    }  
(I have tried `return View(siavm)` here as well.)  

And in my _Layout.cshtml used by all pages I have:  

    @Html.Partial(""_SignedInAsPartial"")  


Trying to load any page now results in a NullReferenceException and the visual debugger stops at _SignedInAsPartial.cshtml

    [Serializable]
    public class ModelB
    {

I step in my code and just before I do the update, I see that my deserialized model contains a list ListOfModelA that in turn contains all the elements that should be there, and within them I can see all the HiddenStringA and HiddenStringB properties. Then I peek inside the form and I see a dictionary with keys like these:

    ModelAs[0].StringA 
    ModelAs[0].StringB
    ModelAs[1].StringB
    ModelAs[1].StringB

while there are NO keys for the rest of the properties like this one: 

    ModelAs[0].HiddenStringA

Next, I move one step further and I let the code do the TryUpdateModel. Now, looking inside the ListOfModelA property, all the elements have been replaced with new ones that have all the hidden values null. It is as if the update reconstructed whole elements (with the limited information it had), rather than updating only the properties for which it had information.

Is this the expected behaviour? Is there a way to keep my model, and update only the properties that have keys in the dictionary?

As is often the case, this all works wonderfully locally. The problem comes when accessing the Url on the web server. When I navigate to the 'Guides' action it all works fine, however navigating to the 'Discussions' action returns a 404. The strange thing is that accessing the same Url in a browser on the server itself works fine! 

It's running on Windows Server 2008 R2 (IIS7) with application pool set to Integrated. It's also MVC 3 on .Net 4.

Has anyone seen anything like this before or have any idea how to diagnose? I'm not sure where to go from here...",1

The binding of `IRepository<ComicBookIssue>` to `ComicBookIssuesRepository` works fine, as it is able to construct and inject the `ComicBookIssueController` with no errors. However, when trying to inject into the `AccountController`, it throws the following error: 

    Error activating IAccountRepository{User}
    No matching bindings are available, and the type is not self-bindable.
    Activation path:
     2) Injection of dependency IAccountRepository{User} into parameter repository 
        of constructor of type AccountController
     1) Request for AccountController
    
    Suggestions:
     1) Ensure that you have defined a binding for IAccountRepository{User}.
     2) If the binding was defined in a module, ensure that the module has been 
        loaded into the kernel.
     3) Ensure you have not accidentally created more than one kernel.
     4) If you are using constructor arguments, ensure that the parameter name 
        matches the constructors parameter name.
     5) If you are using automatic module loading, ensure the search path and 
        filters are correct.

I can't figure out what is causing the error for one dependency and not the other. The two follow the same pattern, just implement different interfaces. Has any one else experienced this error or can find a problem with my implementation?

            }
        }

The binding of `IRepository<ComicBookIssue>` to `ComicBookIssuesRepository` works fine, as it is able to construct and inject the `ComicBookIssueController` with no errors. However, when trying to inject into the `AccountController`, it throws the following error: 

    Error activating IAccountRepository{User}
    No matching bindings are available, and the type is not self-bindable.
    Activation path:
     2) Injection of dependency IAccountRepository{User} into parameter repository 
        of constructor of type AccountController
     1) Request for AccountController
    
    Suggestions:
     1) Ensure that you have defined a binding for IAccountRepository{User}.
     2) If the binding was defined in a module, ensure that the module has been 
        loaded into the kernel.
     3) Ensure you have not accidentally created more than one kernel.
     4) If you are using constructor arguments, ensure that the parameter name 
        matches the constructors parameter name.
     5) If you are using automatic module loading, ensure the search path and 
        filters are correct.

I can't figure out what is causing the error for one dependency and not the other. The two follow the same pattern, just implement different interfaces. Has any one else experienced this error or can find a problem with my implementation?

when trying to go to this view I see an editor for both Id and Username, but if i fill Id - I've got error, because there is no Entry in DB with such Id.
Ok.Let's look for attributes to hide an editor.
[ScaffoldColumn(false)] is something like a marker whether to render an editor for Id or not.
applaying it to my model I've got null id posting from my View.Try another attr.
[ReadOnly(true)] makes a field a readonly-field. But at the same time I've got null in posting Id.
Modifying a view I placed an editors for each field in model

    @Html.HiddenFor(model => model.NameId)
    @Html.EditorFor(model => model.Username)

but using it is dangerous because some user can post wrong Id throgh post-request.

I can't use [ScaffoldColumn(false)] with applying Id at [Httppost] action of the controller,by searching appropriate user-entry in DB, because the name was changed..

adding and editing view
adding is working well, the question is about editing
I use

        @using (Html.BeginForm())
        {
            @Html.ValidationSummary(true)
            <fieldset>
            <legend> legend </legend>
            @Html.EditorForModel()
            <p>
                    <input type=""submit"" value=""Save"" />
                </p>
        </fieldset>
        }
    
    <div>
        @Html.ActionLink(""Back to List"", ""Index"")
    </div>

to edit my model.
when trying to go to this view I see an editor for both Id and Username, but if i fill Id - I've got error, because there is no Entry in DB with such Id.
Ok.Let's look for attributes to hide an editor.
[ScaffoldColumn(false)] is something like a marker whether to render an editor for Id or not.
applaying it to my model I've got null id posting from my View.Try another attr.
[ReadOnly(true)] makes a field a readonly-field. But at the same time I've got null in posting Id.
Modifying a view I placed an editors for each field in model

    @Html.HiddenFor(model => model.NameId)
    @Html.EditorFor(model => model.Username)

but using it is dangerous because some user can post wrong Id throgh post-request.

I can't use [ScaffoldColumn(false)] with applying Id at [Httppost] action of the controller,by searching appropriate user-entry in DB, because the name was changed..
I can't believe  @Html.HiddenFor is the only way out.But can't find one :(",3

I'm using jQuery/jQuery UI, but I'm opened to other javascript alternatives (like Backbone, etc - I just don't know them yet).

I have achieved above by MVC Routing, and by overriding RouteData.GetRouteData method of RouteBase. Whenever the request is a clean url, it handles the request and adds new routes in the Global.asax file and displays the Item view. 

On Item view page, I am having a Jquery Ajax call to the JsonResult method EstimateShipping of Item controller. ""$.ajax({url: '/Item/EstimateShipping', .... ""  

When Jquery ajax post is called the RouteData.GetRouteData method of RouteBase receives /Item/EstimateShipping ({controller}/{action}). We need this pattern since we need to call action of controller class on post. 

The problem now is in RouteData.GetRouteData method where I need to know that /Item/EstimateShipping should not be considered as clean (url) and it should be sent to the default routes in Global.asax. 

Has anyone come across such situation ? Please provide me some suggestion on this.

And I am using an HtmlHelperExtension to construct the ActionImage:

    public static MvcHtmlString ActionImage(this HtmlHelper html, string action, object routeValues, string imagePath, string alt)
        {
            var url = new UrlHelper(html.ViewContext.RequestContext);

Although my website has started taking shape, it is taking shape slowly! Probably because I’m a novice and everything is new to me.

Last night I had a play around with web matrix/ asp.net webpages and I really must say it was a great experience; everything is so simple right out the box, data access is so easy it’s a joy to do. So now I’ve hit a little bit of a dilemma should I build my website (simple ecommerce site) in asp.net webpages or stick to MVC 3? 

I’ve done some research on the differences between the two asp.net approaches. The main differences I can find , 2 of them, are that MVC is obviously made up of  3 layers (model, view, controller )which nicely  separates  business logic and front end  and also MVC offers  testing. (Testing which is a whole new level for me so prob won’t look into it at this point in time). Other than that both can deliver websites of equal quality.

So my question is: As I’m a newbie to web programming should I move to asp.net webpages so I can get to see quicker results which will keep me interested in getting the website done or slug it out with MVC 3? Why shouldn’t I make the move to asp.net webpages?

The only thing at the moment that’s holding me back is asp.net webpages doesn’t have nearly as many tutorials and examples available like MVC. Also it hasn’t really captured a wide audience of developers yet and will it ever?

I'm using FULL TEXT Engine to search the table, so used the SQL Connection manually, you can also drag and drop the store procedure and use pure LINQ.

The above code first uses SQL connection to fetch data and put it into SQLDBReader, then i used LINQ to SORT and PAGE. There are many ways to do, this is one of the way.


Controller:

    public ActionResult LeadsSearch(String searchValue, FormCollection form, int? Page, String sort)
            {
                   var startPage = 0;
                    Page = Session[""Page""] != null ? ((int?)Session[""Page""]).Value : 1;
                    if (Page.HasValue && Page.Value > 0)
                    { startPage = Page.Value - 1; }

",asp.net-mvc-3,sorting,checkbox,paging,webgrid,09/01/2011 02:00:42,not a real question,1,4536,14,"Multiple Checkbox selection using Webgrid in MVC 3 (select All/Deselect All), Sorting and Paging If you are wondering how to make multiple checkboxes and Multiple checkbox selection (select All or Deselect All),paging, sorting in a MVC3 Webgrid, here is the solution:

To Simplify, It has the following features:

1. Checkbox in the webgrid
2. Multiple checkbox selection (select all /deselect all)
3. Paging using LINQ
4. Sorting using LINQ 



         @{var grid = new WebGrid(rowsPerPage: ThisController._pageSize,
         canPage: true, canSort: true, ajaxUpdateContainerId: ""webgrid"");
                    grid.Bind(Model.TypeList, rowCount: Model.TotalRecordCount,
         autoSortAndPage: false);
                  grid.Pager(WebGridPagerModes.All);
    
    <div style=""margin-left:75px;"" ><input id=""toggleAllCheckBox"" type=""checkbox""/></div>
    
         @grid.GetHtml(
                        tableStyle: ""webgrid"",
                        headerStyle: ""webgrid-header"",
                        footerStyle: ""webgrid-footer"",
                        alternatingRowStyle: ""webgrid-alternating-row"",
                        selectedRowStyle: ""webgrid-selected-row"",
                        rowStyle: ""webgrid-row-style"",
                            htmlAttributes: new { id = ""webgrid"" },
                        columns: grid.Columns(
                             grid.Column(header: ""Assign?"", style: ""labelcolumn"",
                                            format:
                                                @<text><input class=""check-box"" id=""assignChkBx"" type=""checkbox"" value=""@item.ContactId"" /></text>),
                            grid.Column(""CompanyName"", ""Company Name""),
                            grid.Column(""Title"", ""Title""),
                            grid.Column(""FirstName"", ""First Name""),
                            grid.Column(""LastName"", ""Last Name""),
                            grid.Column(""Street"", ""Street""),
                            grid.Column(""City"", ""City""),
                            grid.Column(""State"", ""State""),
                            grid.Column(""ZipCode"", ""ZipCode""),
                            grid.Column(""ZipPlus4"", ""ZipPlus4""),
                            grid.Column(""Phone"", ""Phone"", canSort: false),
                            grid.Column(""Fax"", ""Fax"", canSort: false),
                            grid.Column(""UserName"", ""AssignedTo"")
                            )) 
        
        }
    
       

I'm returning the model that has two properties (a class [ContactModel] and int property[TotalRecordCount] which has total number of records)

It's important that you tell tell the webgrid, how many total rows it will have; so that its used for paging.

Jquery:

 

     $(document).ready(function () {
            $(""#toggleAllCheckBox"").click(function () {
                if ($(this).attr(""checked"")) {
                    $("".check-box"").attr(""checked"", true);
                    
                } else {
                    $("".check-box"").attr(""checked"", false);
                   
                }
            });
        });


Domain Model:

 

     public class GenericModelTypes<T> //Generics
        {
            public IList<T> TypeList { get; set; }
    
            public Int32 TotalRecordCount {get; set;}
        }

  - I'm going crazy at this point. I'll be happy to provide more information if requested.

I tried using TryUpdateModel(job) and UpdateModel(job) after assigning the values.Both of these does not seem to update the model because ModelState.IsValid return false.Can someone point me in the right directions?I am using MVC3

Thanks,

Without wildcard application mapping my application works fine, despite one issue. When I try request for *.js file, ex: http://www.my.app.com/res/script.js, such request is not processed by MVC application. The file is served directly by IIS (which searches virtual directory for such file). It is not desired for me, because I need custom processing of some *.js files (I need to redirect the requests for them to different locations, so I've written controller for that). For such requests to be maintained by my MVC application, I've added wildcard application map in IIS settings. Now requests for *.js files are processed by MVC and passed through my controller.

It seems to be ok, but what are the threats of such approach ? Are there any major performance issues ? Can this all be done in some better way ? Mabye without IIS configuration (just web.confing changes) ?
