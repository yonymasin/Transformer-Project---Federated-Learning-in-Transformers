I plan to allow normal users to login with just 'read' permissions, and only authorise 'read-write' permissions if/when they decide to create things within the site.

In my `Identity` model I'm analysing the `AuthHash` omniauth passes to the create_with_omniauth action, and I'm making separate logic for each provider type, so that I can look deeper into the returned hash schema if necessary.

If I `raise auth.to_yaml` to output the structure, I see the 'x-access-level' header that I'd like to read, but I don't know how to look into the `response: Net::HTTPOK` object in order to get to the next level of the structure.

For each ticket the support system user needs to be able to select one or more companies and from those companies select one or more employees.

The schema is so far setup as company has_many users and tickets are linked to users (regardless of company) by an intermediate table with simple ticket_id and user_id fields.

Previously a large multiselect was used but even with the company name added to the text and the collection ordered by company_name and forename the list quickly became extremely long and one false click and the selection would be reset.

I guess what I am looking for is a way to list companies, as the company is selected it will populate a list of users for that company with an add/remove to add or remove them from the list of users assigned to that ticket.

I am thinking :

Company dropdown -> [populates] -> user list -> [Add|Remove buttons] -> List of users saved in database.

Thanks in advance for any ideas.

##Adding snippets to a Post
Now if I want to add two text snippets and two image snippets to a post I can do this:

    # find the first post
    p = Post.first

    p.texts << Text.create(:text => ""This is the first sentence"")
    p.images << Image.create(:image => ""first_image.jpg"")
    p.texts << Text.create(:text => ""This is the second sentence"")
    p.images << Image.create(:image => ""second_image.jpg"")

The result is a blog post that looks like this:

- text snippet
- image snippet
- text snippet
- image snippet


##My Problem
I'm having some trouble displaying the content of each snippet in my view.

I **could** do the following in my view:

    - for text in @post.texts
      = text.text
    - for image in @post.images
      = image.image
    - for code in @post.codes
      = code.code
    - for video in @post.videos
      = video.video


**BUT** this will result in a blog post that looks like this:

- text snippet
- text snippet
- image snippet
- image snippet

I don't want snippets to be grouped by Class in this way.

##How can I solve this?
Well I've a look at the problem. I know that I **CAN** do the following:

    - for snippet in @post.snippets
      = snippet.snippetable_type.downcase

and this will output the Class name of each snippet as shown:

- text
- image
- text
- image

BUT I want the content of each snippet.

Expanding on what we have above, since each type of snippet has one attribute with the same name as the Class itself, I can also do this:

    - for snippet in @post.snippets
      = ""#{snippet.snippetable_type.downcase}.#{snippet.snippetable_type.downcase}""

And this will output the classname AND the attribute name of each snippet:

- text.text
- image.image
- text.text
- image.image

If I could just find a way of getting to the content and not the Classnames then I'd be ok. Anyone got any clue?

I will be absolutely amazed if anyone gets this one. Thanks if you have read this far.

    end

    create_table ""accounts"", :force => true do |t|
      t.string   ""subdomain""
      t.integer  ""user_id""
   end


 and there is a current_account method defined in applications_controller like this


 
     def current_account
      if !is_root_domain?
       current_account = Account.find_by_subdomain(request.subdomains.first)
        if current_account.nil?
         redirect_to root_url(:account => false, :alert => ""Unknown Account/subdomain"")
      end
      else 
      current_account = nil
     end
    return current_account
   end  
  

  which calls is_root_domain? method below:


    def is_root_domain?
      result = (request.subdomains.first.present? && request.subdomains.first != ""www"") ? false : true
   end
  

But i get the undefined method `subdomain' for nil:NilClass error on the SitesController#index. which is shown below while trying to access the url:



    class SitesController < ApplicationController
      def index
        @site = Site.find_by_subdomain(current_account.subdomain)
      end
  
     def opps
       @site = Site.find_by_subdomain(current_account.subdomain)
     end
  end
  

 I have tried the various tricks of battling no method error that i know of, like adding 'attr_ccessible' and an initiliaze method but nothing seems to work. I also changed the Accounts table field from 'subdomain' to 'name', but no success. Any guide will be appreciated.",2

I have seen many sites being built on wordpress , also checked Ruby on Rails site like twitter and Ruby seems
to be a great framework for building website. 

Suggestions please ? Thanks for your time !",3

I mean that items that are for example less than 5 minutes from each other would be recursively grouped. By recursive I mean that the first and last item don't have to be less than 5 minutes away from each other, but they need to have items between them that are all closer than 5 minutes away from the previous and next item. So what I need is a way of comparing the current item with the previous item and if they are closer than 5 minutes away from each other, the current item is added to the same group as the previous item.

The problem is that using group_by, I can't find the previous item, so that I could compare the timestamps. I've tried some silly stuff like this just to compare those items:

    a.group_by { |x| x.created_at - a[a.index(x)-1].created_at }

But I get:

Is there a way to do this using group_by, or do I need to iterate ""manually"" through those items? Any suggestions for a pretty efficient solution, as the number of items is quite large?

This means the collection of Things knows its limit relative to a User.  In our case, a Manager may adjust the limit (of Things) for each User, so the User must limit its collection of Things.  We *could* have thing_count_within_limit request the limit from its user:

    if self.user.things(:reload).count >= self.user.thing_limit

But, that's a lot of user introspection from Thing.

I thought `has_many :things, :before_add => :limit_things` would work, but we must raise an exception to [stop the chain][2].  That forces me to update the controller to handle exceptions instead of the rails convention of `if valid?` or `if save`.

To do this, I have to update models and controllers AND can't follow convention?  Am I missing something?  Am I misusing `has_many, :before_add`?  I looked for an example using :before_add, but couldn't find any.

I thought about moving the validation to User, but that only occurs on User save/update.  I don't see a way to use it to stop the addition of a Thing.

I prefer a solution for Rails 3 (if that matters for this problem).

    file = kit.to_file(""pdf_test.pdf"")
    send_file(""#{Rails.root}/public/pdf_test.pdf"")

 - Multiple (4-5 and growing) small PHP
   apps with 1-2 dev's working on these

Issues:

 - no testing
 - no documentation 
 - a fragile and tedious deployment
   process

I'm being moved from the single large app over to the side of the house with the multiple smaller apps.  The lack of testing and a proper deployment process in our shop makes me nervous that I'll spend more time fixing bugs and deploying fixes than actually writing code for new features.

Solution A:

 - Introduce PHPUnit and Selenium
 - Move us over to Phing and Dbdeploy

Problem with A:
Setting up PHPUnit has been relatively easy, but functional testing with Selenium has been a total pain. Our VM's work great for dev, but Selenium pegs the needle, plus a few simple tests take forever. I don't doubt I could get all of these technologies playing well together, but it all seems like a mess and the complexity of these working together seems fragile.

Solution B:
Based on the major issues of testing, I began to look into Rails. Based on the nature of these other sites we manage, I think Rails may be a good solution.  Built-in testing, great community, lots of great tools, and fast development.

Problem with B:
Every app we have right now is on Kohana 2 (PHP framework) and no one in the organization knows Rails. The downside to introducing a new technology would be fracturing the teams.  If I migrate the sites to Rails, then get hit by a bus, we're kind of screwed. 

Bottom line:
Stick with PHP/Kohana, pause development, and work in PHPUnit+Selenium+Phing+DbDeploy.

-or-

Introduce Rails into the system and move right along. The benefits to Rails outweigh the complications of having two frameworks.  If I go with this one, I've got a LOT of convincing to do.

Any suggestions?  Anyone gone through anything similar?  Management has already told me that they're open to hearing about Rails and want to use the best tool possible.

The question appeared not (only) because of my laziness, but also because ""best practice"" approach is usually well-developed, have fewer pitfalls, etc. Currently I think about following models/fields:

**Company:**

 - name
 - has_many :persons
 - has_many :locations
 - has_many :urls, :through => :urlcatalog

 the reason to have URL catalog is a possibility to assign notes to URL

**Person:**

 - name _maybe split to first-middle-last_
 - phone
 - has_one :location
 - has_many :emails :through => :emailcatalog

 the reason to have email catalog is the same as above: one can assign
""private"", ""office"" labels to it.  many phones can be organized this way as well.

**Location**

 - address _optional_

The question appeared not (only) because of my laziness, but also because ""best practice"" approach is usually well-developed, have fewer pitfalls, etc. Currently I think about following models/fields:

**Company:**

 - name
 - has_many :persons
 - has_many :locations
 - has_many :urls, :through => :urlcatalog

 the reason to have URL catalog is a possibility to assign notes to URL

**Person:**

 - name _maybe split to first-middle-last_
 - phone
 - has_one :location
 - has_many :emails :through => :emailcatalog

 the reason to have email catalog is the same as above: one can assign
""private"", ""office"" labels to it.  many phones can be organized this way as well.

I've tried rebuilding the index `rake environment tire:import CLASS=Article FORCE=true` but type remains a string. Anyone see where I'm messing up?

For example, one resource is a `widget`.  `Widgets` can be `foo`ed and they can be `bar`ed.  `Gizmo`s can also be `foo`ed and `bar`ed.  These usage types are billed at different rates, possibly even different rates for different clients.  Each occurence of a usage (of a resource) is recorded in the Usage table.  Each billing rate (for client, resource, and type combination) is stored in the billing table.

*(By the way, if this data schema is not the right way to approach this problem, please make suggestions.)*

Is it possible, using Ruby on Rails and ActiveRecord, to create a `has_many` relationship from Billings to Usages so that I can get a list of usage instances for a given billing rate?  Is there a syntax of the `has_many, :through` that I don't know?

It seems like development performance would be slightly impacted, which is not that big of a deal to me. How would performance be impacted in a production environment? Do all of the files generally get loaded only once if you are in production anyway? Is there a better way that I'm not seeing?

If you could include some resources where I could read more about this, they would be greatly appreciated. Some blog posts said that this behavior changed recently with Rails 3 for autoreloading lib/* files and that it was contentious, but I didn't see any links to these discussions. It would be helpful for considering the pros/cons. Thanks!",4

I would like to find a compromise between performance and price. I think that for now it is enough (maybe) a shared server, but any suggestions are appreciated.

In localhost I am using

 - Ruby on Rails 3.0.9
 - ruby-1.9.2-p136
 - Apache
 - Phusion Passenger
 - MySql

so the hosting server should satisfy the above requisites.

This is my first time that I try to deploy a Ruby on Rails application, so I am not expert on the matter.

I would like to find a compromise between performance and price. I think that for now it is enough (maybe) a shared server, but any suggestions are appreciated.

In localhost I am using

 - Ruby on Rails 3.0.9
 - ruby-1.9.2-p136
 - Apache
 - Phusion Passenger
 - MySql

so the hosting server should satisfy the above requisites.

There is already a functioning PHP application that is successfully posting to this API, but we are moving ruby on rails and i am trying to get a testsite connected.

in the PHP app, which i did not create, they are using cURL and setting POSTVARS to an encoded variable that appears to be in javascript dot notation. 

I am using HTTParty so when i take my post data and convert it to JSON and submit it, it's a no go because with HTTParty, post vars have to be a hash.

When I send the post data without encoding it, i get a malformed JSON error. 

i guess my simple question at the moment is...
  is there a simple way to convert a multidimensional hash into an array of key value pairs where the key is the JSON dot notation for that value? (probably not)

I've looked at these articles for solutions, but i'm pretty new to ruby and rails, so i haven't made much progress yet.


http://www.goodercode.com/wp/convert-your-hash-keys-to-object-properties-in-ruby/

this is a great article, but i'm not sure how you implement that code. i put it in a hashify.rb file in the /lib directory and restarted, but it didn't seem to work at all. 

i've also tried writing a class like this:

    class Hashify
   
     def initialize(hash)
       hash.each do |k, v|
         
         k=k.gsub(/\.|\s|-|\/|\'/, '_').downcase.to_sym

 ",ruby-on-rails,ruby,json,hash,,,open,0,379,8,"POSTing JSON to API from Ruby on Rails I am trying to post to this third party API that is (based on node.js and couchDB)
There is already a functioning PHP application that is successfully posting to this API, but we are moving ruby on rails and i am trying to get a testsite connected.

in the PHP app, which i did not create, they are using cURL and setting POSTVARS to an encoded variable that appears to be in javascript dot notation. 

I am using HTTParty so when i take my post data and convert it to JSON and submit it, it's a no go because with HTTParty, post vars have to be a hash.

When I send the post data without encoding it, i get a malformed JSON error. 

i guess my simple question at the moment is...
  is there a simple way to convert a multidimensional hash into an array of key value pairs where the key is the JSON dot notation for that value? (probably not)

I've looked at these articles for solutions, but i'm pretty new to ruby and rails, so i haven't made much progress yet.


http://www.goodercode.com/wp/convert-your-hash-keys-to-object-properties-in-ruby/

this is a great article, but i'm not sure how you implement that code. i put it in a hashify.rb file in the /lib directory and restarted, but it didn't seem to work at all. 

i've also tried writing a class like this:

    class Hashify
   
     def initialize(hash)
       hash.each do |k, v|
         
         k=k.gsub(/\.|\s|-|\/|\'/, '_').downcase.to_sym

         self.instance_variable_set(""@#{k}"", v) ## create and initialize an instance variable for this key/value pair
         self.class.send(:define_method, k, proc { self.instance_variable_get(""@#{k}"") }) ## create the getter that returns the instance variable
         self.class.send(:define_method, ""#{k}="", proc { |v| self.instance_variable_set(""@#{k}"", v) }) ## create the setter that sets the instance variable
       end
     end
    end

As you can see, the 'count' variable is shared across all threads.

**Now,** what I want to do is **share 'count'** across multiple httpd requests and **allow my_action in MyController to have access to that variable**. For instance, maybe whatever spawns the ruby process to serve httpd process could hold the variable count in its scope, and then the ruby processes spawned for httpd processes could then access that variable.

Using memcached, a database, and session variables is out of the question. Ultimately 'count' will actually be a resource object...an FTP connection.

Is this possible? Perhaps using Apache/Passenger workers like [this][1]?

Example code would be appreciated.

    Make sure that `gem install pg -v '0.14.0'` succeeds before bundling.


I installed postgresql using homebrew, `brew install postgresql`, thus `which psql` gives me `/usr/local/bin/psql`

Any help is appreciated!

For some reason I have some tests failing which seemingly is coming from the fact that it can't find the data. Any idea on how to make this work and why it wouldn't like ""pre-seeded"" databases?

Our data is far too complex to try to recreate via factories/fixtures. There's just no way.

Here's an example:

    Scenario: a tech logs in                                                                             
      Given I am on the login page                                                                  
      And user with id 2328 exists                                                                 
      When I login as ""user"" with password ""password""                                            
      Then I should be on the dashboard page                                                             
      And I should see ""Logged in as: USER"" 

The step:

    Given /^user with id (\d+) exists$/ do |id|
      Employee.exists? id
    end


    When /^I login as ""([^\""]*)"" with password ""([^\""]*)""$/ do |username, password|
      visit login_url
      fill_in ""username"", with: username 
      fill_in ""pwd"", with: password
      click_button ""Login""
    end

Maybe its my steps and has nothing to do with the database, but I can't understand why it doesn't fail on the `And user with id 2328 exists` step when I give it a bad number.

I have seen [this][1] but it doesn't seem to affect the flow.

Lastly, here is the actual login method (believe me, I know how awful this login check is, simply checking we have permissions to the database):

        if request.post?

            # if no exception, get the employee ID and location
            session[:employee_id] = plsql.hes.installer_web_pkg.get_employee_pk.to_i
            session[:employee_location] = plsql.hes.installer_web_pkg.fn_get_truck_location(session[:employee_id]).to_i
    
            # logout

            render :action => ""login""

I have the updated gem installed, and after `rails PROJECT_NAME` , I did `haml --rails` in its root.

It apparently had worked fine, since I have haml folder inside plugins, init.rb, as expected.

But when I try to rake, or rails server, I get:

<!-- language: lang-ruby -->

    class Comment < ActiveRecord::Base
      def reject
        self.transaction do
          attributes = {
            :rejected => true,
            :date_reviewed => Time.now.day

            slap_user_on_wrist
          end
        end
      end
    end

This contrived method is doing several things. It's changing the comment's state, persisting it to the database, then slapping the user on the wrist if the comment has been successfully saved.

I've been playing around with a basic framework that would allow methods like this to shed one of their responsibilities: persistence.

<!-- language: lang-ruby -->

    class Comment < ActiveRecord::Base
      include RunTimeInstanceCallbacks

      def reject
        self.rejected = true
        self.date_reviewed = Time.now.day

        run(:slap_user_on_wrist, :after_save)
      end
    end

Here's the very simple module:

<!-- language: lang-ruby -->

    module RunTimeInstanceCallbacks

<!-- language: lang-ruby -->

    class Comment < ActiveRecord::Base
      def reject
        self.transaction do
          attributes = {
            :rejected => true,

This contrived method is doing several things. It's changing the comment's state, persisting it to the database, then slapping the user on the wrist if the comment has been successfully saved.

I've been playing around with a basic framework that would allow methods like this to shed one of their responsibilities: persistence.

<!-- language: lang-ruby -->

    class Comment < ActiveRecord::Base
      include RunTimeInstanceCallbacks

      def reject
        self.rejected = true
        self.date_reviewed = Time.now.day

        run(:slap_user_on_wrist, :after_save)
      end
    end

Here's the very simple module:

<!-- language: lang-ruby -->

    module RunTimeInstanceCallbacks
      def instance_after_save
        return true if @messages_to_send.nil?

        @messages_to_send[:after_save].uniq.each do |message|
          self.send(message)
        end
        @messages_to_send[:after_save] = []

      def run(method, when_to_run)
        @messages_to_send ||= Hash.new([])
        @messages_to_send[when_to_run] << method
      end

      def RunTimeInstanceCallbacks.included(klass)
        klass.class_eval do

At the moment, the filter chain is built as the classes are loaded.  I have a very particular need for the filter chain to be rebuilt at some point in time after the classes have loaded.

This is to do with a Rails project (Spree, Radiant may also be affected I'm guessing) that uses extensions which can do things like this **after** the filter chain has been built for MyController:

    MyController.class_eval do
      before_filter :my_filter_method

    ApplicationController.class_eval do
      before_filter :app_filter_method

The problem here is that the `app_filter_method` filter will **not** be added to the MyController filter chain.  This is because the filter chain of MyController is built from an earlier copy of the filter chain of ApplicationController.  This copy of the filter chain of ApplicationController does **not** yet have the `app_filter_method` filter applied to it.

I can think of 2 places so far that the rebuilding of the FilterChain could happen in:

1) Each time it is called on MyController.filter_chain

2) Reloadable on demand. So MyController.reload_filter_chain will rebuild the filter chain, using the filters from MyController's subclasses in the chain.

    class Head < ActiveRecord::Base
      belongs_to :person
    end

Here, I need to add the foreign_key (Persons's primary key) in the table 'head'.

Now, if I need to get the 'head' of a 'person', rails need to scan through the head table and match the person_id. 

The straight forward way I would think is to add the foreign key in 'person' table. Then I can directly refer the 'head' from 'person' with it's ID.

It appears that rails convention is not performance friendly. Am I missing something here?

Thanks in advance for your help.

What it basically does is take a string from a form, and performs a like query via a model method. What I'm trying to do is conditionally search to different columns(due_date and name) in the database with a single string that I parse with the Date class. That way a user can search for items by a date, or the item name witht he same form. My method looks like:

    def self.search(search) 
        if search
          search_date = Date.parse(search) rescue nil
        end

        else
          scoped
        end
      end  

This works, as if the user types in a date, the Date class is able to parse it, an look in the database for any objects that have that due_date. The problem is, if it is a date and it's able to be parse, the search is incredibly slow.

I was wondering if anyone had a way of speeding this up. Is it the Date class that is so slow? Should I have two different methods? or Should I completely rewrite my search?

What I'm trying to do is conditionally search to different columns(due_date and name) in the database with a single string that I parse with the Date class. That way a user can search for items by a date, or the item name witht he same form. My method looks like:

    def self.search(search) 
        if search
          search_date = Date.parse(search) rescue nil
        end
      
        if search_date
          where('due_date = ?', search_date)
        elsif search
          where('UPPER(name) LIKE ?', ""%#{search.upcase}%"")
        else
          scoped
        end
      end  

This works, as if the user types in a date, the Date class is able to parse it, an look in the database for any objects that have that due_date. The problem is, if it is a date and it's able to be parse, the search is incredibly slow.

I was wondering if anyone had a way of speeding this up. Is it the Date class that is so slow? Should I have two different methods? or Should I completely rewrite my search?

I want to offload the costs of hosting and streaming video to YouTube, but I don't know the best way to move forward with this part of the functionality.

I see two directions I can go in:

*Easier to manage approach:* Let the users upload videos to their own YouTube account via my Rails app or through YouTube, and then give the users the option to ""Upload"" or ""Specify Video URL"" in the HTML form. The downside is users have to setup and manage their own YouTube accounts, which most people don't already do.

*Better usability approach:* Create a single YouTube account, owned and maintained by me, and only give users the ability to upload video via my web app to that YouTube account.  This makes it easier for users to upload video since they don't need a YouTube account, improving the usability of my app.  The downside is, the YouTube account will have to be managed, the YouTube limits will be reached quicker (meaning I'll have to delete older videos often), among other downsides.

 1. With those two approaches in mind, how would you add YouTube support to your Rails 3 app that allows the user to login to their YouTube account thru my web app?

 2. How would you add YouTube support to your Rails 3 app that allows the user to upload video to their YouTube account once logged in (Easier To Manage Approach) or my account (Better Usability Approach)?

 3. Would you use an existing Gem or write your own Rails 3 code to interact directly with the YouTube API?  

 4. Are there other video hosting services you would consider using besides YouTube?

I am using the RestClient gem in order to do this. There are a ton of tools available to do the same thing, so that should not matter.

What I'm curious about is having good enough tests, nothing too fancy, where I can simulate how my application responds when the third party web service is unavailable for whatever reason. Be it that I exceeded a rate limit or a timeout due to network latency/complications, I just want to be able to take something like an HTTP status code and test what my application does in that event.

What's the best way to do this with Test::Unit? Right now the call to the third party service is encapsulated inside of one of my controllers. I have a simple module with some wrapper methods for the different end points of the remote service. I just want to make sure that my application does the right things when the service is or isn't available.

Is using an additional framework next to Test::Unit that can 'stub' the right way to go about doing this? Obviously I can't force a network timeout and starting to hack with things like IPtables just for tests is not worth the time.

        <p><%= render :partial => 'standards', :locals => { :f => f, :sid => r.id } %></p>
      <% end %>

Here is the standards partial view:

      <%= f.association :standards, :collection => Standard.active_std.all(:order => 'name'), :label_method => :name, :value_method => :id, 
                                    :prompt => ""Choose std"", :label => ""standard："", :include_blank => true, :selected => :sid %>

When rendered, standards partial view should render a collection of standards with sid selected. However the code above does not select the standards at all. Tried sid (string) :selected => sid. This causes error saying that sid was not defined.

My question is what's the right way to pass and retrieve a local var in view? Thanks so much.",2

**How do I deploy a Ruby on Rails App in production environment (which version of Ruby and Rails should I use) if I am on Mac OS X Lion 10.7.2 and preferably would like to try Heroku (which stack), or something equally easy to use?**

I am following [Ruby On Rails Tutorial][1]. Following the instructions in the book I try to deploy on [Heroku][2], but with no luck. Printouts from the Heroku log gives:

    2012-01-22T18:26:09+00:00 app[web.1]: Started GET ""/pages/about"" for 90.231.141.39 at

    2012-01-22T18:26:09+00:00 app[web.1]: ActiveRecord::ConnectionNotEstablished   
    (ActiveRecord::ConnectionNotEstablished):

This application does not use any database at this point (only presenting static pages). So to me the ActiveRecord error comes as no suprise. Uncertain though if this is the root to the problem. I first thought that this issue was realted to Heroku, since my `rails server` deployment worked fine, but the I found the `rails server -e production` command to run the rails server in production environment. Under Rails 3.1.3 this renders the page correctly, but I still get the following error message in the server log:

    sample_app$ rails server -e production
    => Booting WEBrick
    => Rails 3.1.3 application starting in production on http://0.0.0.0:3000

    => Ctrl-C to shutdown server

    cache: [GET /assets/application-cd728f3a08415c27ca2e753d30091c74.css] miss

It seems to me that there is some kind of routing issue. But my lack of knowledge and experience with RoR makes me a lame duck in the search for the actual error.

Upgrading to Rails 3.2.0 made the issue even worse. I made a sample app for Rails 3.2 basically with:

    rails new test_app

Entered the ""test_app"" folder and ran `rails server -e production` (using `Ruby 1.9.3-p0`). This time the default Ruby on Rails index page was not even rendered. The server log gives me:

    heroku_test$ rails server -e production
    => Booting WEBrick
    => Rails 3.2.0 application starting in production on http://0.0.0.0:3000

So, it seems in all cases like I have some issues with my routing or my caching or wathever.

These are my specs:

    System specs: Mac OS X Lion 10.7.2
    Ruby: 1.9.3-p0
    Rails: 3.1.3 (and also 3.2.0 release the other day)

I am very aware that these specs are not what Ruby on Rails Tutorial propose. The RoR tutorial is written with the follow Specs in mind:

    Ruby: 1.9.2 (or 1.8.7)
    Rails: 3.0.11

In [chapter 13][3], Hartl explains the difference with Rails 3.1.x and sports an upgrade guide for the sample_app. I've skimmed through this chapter (since I am stuck at chapter 3) but have been unable to find a remedy to my problems.

      respond_with(@cards) do |format|
          format.amf { render :amf => @cards.to_amf}  
      end
    end

through a call from Actionscript i would like to return some data in amf format.

further more, as mentioned in the instructions for rails3-amf i did the following.
in my production.rb under config/environment i added the line

    config.rails3amf.map_params :controller => 'CardvosController', :action => 'getRandomCards'

an my amf gateway got 

    config.rails3amf.gateway_path = ""/gateway""

The problem is:

Any call from Actionscript / Flash raises the following
(taken from the log )

    Started POST ""/gateway"" for 192.178.168.1 at Fri Nov 19 15:13:28 +0100 2010
      Processing by CardvosController#getRandomCards as AMF
      Parameters: {0=>100.0}
      [1m[36mSQL (0.4ms)[0m  [1mSHOW TABLES[0m
      [1m[35mCardvo Load (0.2ms)[0m  SELECT `cardvos`.* FROM `cardvos` LIMIT 1
    Completed 200 OK in 13ms (Views: 0.9ms | ActiveRecord: 0.5ms)

    NoMethodError (undefined method `constructed?' for #<RocketAMF::Envelope:0x39ba868>):

The Amf file is created but the method, which is in remoting.rb from RocketAMF could not be found.
I think the error is thrown at request_parser.rb from Rails3AMF asking for constructed?

      # Wrap request and response
      env['rack.input'].rewind
      env['rails3amf.request'] = RocketAMF::Envelope.new.populate_from_stream(env['rack.input'].read)
      env['rails3amf.response'] = RocketAMF::Envelope.new

      # Pass up the chain to the request processor, or whatever is layered in between
      result = @app.call(env)

      # Calculate length and return response
      if env['rails3amf.response'].constructed?

For me it seems it is looking at the wron class for the method.
Where
    NoMethodError (undefined method `constructed?' for #RocketAMF::Envelope:0x39ba868):

the essential part is 
    RocketAMF::Envelope:0x39ba868 
which should be 
    RocketAMF:ANOTHER_CLASS:Envelope:0x39ba868

Am i right and where the heck is the error ?
Any help would be appreciated!

I'm looking to build an application that limits a user's viewable data to their company, which is based on their email's domain. Very much like Yammer or basecamp.

I'd like for the each record in the user table to have an InstanceID  that has an ID from the UserInstance table. During registration the UserInstance is either found or assigned (unique)....  Then, all records in the DB would have an InstanceID. Now that all users are assigned to an instanceID... I'd like  everything the signed in user sees in the site to only be for their InstanceID, so company's information is silo'd.

Question:
1. How to modify devise to support the UserInstance table, to assigned or create and then assigned instanceID on registration

So far I'm here, /app/models/user.rb

    class User < ActiveRecord::Base

    def assign_user_to_instance
     Step 1, extract the user's domain from the email address they just registered with
     Step 2, does this domain from s1 exist in the UserInstance Table (domain)?
     Step 2b, if not create it and grab the UserInstance.ID
     Step 2c, if it does, grab the already available UserInstanceID
     Step 3, assign the UserInstanceID to the user's record in the user table

For example the index action is not getting render and instead IE8 display a download dialog, but if i edit the index action like this:

    def index
      @customers = Customer.find_index // a find all but ordered.
      respond_to do |format|

I use the handle as the `to_param` in the model.

At this point, Rails assumes that the changed display name/handle is the one to use for the look up and the update action can't complete at all, because it can't find the user based on the new handle.

The problem is similar to what others have, such as: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/124250/how-to-do-a-rolling-restart-of-a-cluster-of-mongrels

We, however, are using Nginx/Passenger instead of Mongrel.

The issue is that on a deploy if we use this standard :restart task:

  task :restart, :roles => [:app], :except => {:no_release => true} do
    run ""cd #{deploy_to}/current && touch tmp/restart.txt""
  end

It touches the restart.txt file across every web server, but any passenger instances currently serving requests need to finish before the new ones are spawned it seems. This creates a serious delay and causes our app to be unavailable for up to 2 minutes while everything is coming back up.

In order to get around that the plan is to do the following:

1: deploy code
2: go to server 1, remove it from the load balancer
3: restart nginx-passenger on server 1
4: wait 60 seconds
5: add server 1 back to load balancer
6: go to server 2 (repeat steps 3 - 5)

To accomplish this, I attempted this:

(lb.txt is the file that the load balancer looks for)

  task :restart, :roles => [:app], :except => {:no_release => true} do
    servers = find_servers_for_task(current_task)
    servers.map do |s|
      run ""cd #{deploy_to}/current && echo '' > public/lb.txt"", :host => s.host
      run %Q{rvmsudo /etc/init.d/nginx-passenger restart > /dev/null}, :host => s.host
      sleep 60
      run ""cd #{deploy_to}/current && echo 'ok' > public/lb.txt"", :host => s.host
    end
  end

This *almost* works, however, during the deploy it seemed to run the loop through the servers once per servers listed in the :app role. We currently have 6 app servers, so the loop runs 6 times, restarting nginx-passenger 6 times per server.

I just need this loop to run through one time.

I know it seems that eventually passenger will get rolling restarts, but they do not seem to exist yet.

If it helps, we are using Capistrano 2.x and Rails 3

Any help would be great.

On my website, members of the site have two parts: an account and the type of account. First you create an account and then your type is defined later. In this case, we're working with a user type account. Users and accounts are two different models. This code create a user membership to a project. If the the user is not signed up to the website yet, this particular form creates the membership and also creates a new account of the type user.

The user part of the model seems to work (ie first and last name are being saved), however, the account part of the model (email) is not being saved. Any recommendations? My guess is that the e-mail parameter is not being passed correctly to the Account model, though not quite sure how to check which parameters are being sent either.

My rails version is 3.0.7. I am wondering what are the differences between **<% form_for :project_profile %>** and **<% form_for @project_profile %>**. I have this question because I went into the following situation:

 
- If I use **<% form_for :project_profile %>**, it doesn't give me an error, but the form is actually not working.

- If I use **<% form_for @project_profile %>**, I will get an error: undefined method `project_profile_path' for #<#<Class:0x00000103549030>:0x00000103546d80>

- If I use <%= form_for @project_profile, :**url** => ""/projects/#{params[:project_id]}/profile/update"" do |f| %>, it will work but the code is ugly.


--------------------------------------------------

You can refer to the following codes to understand the context of my problem better.

I have a project model and a project_profile model. One project has one project_profile.

The following two lines are from my *routes.rb*.

    match '/projects/:project_id/profile/edit' => ""project_profiles#edit""
    match '/projects/:project_id/profile/update' => ""project_profiles#update""

This is from my project_profiles_controller.rb

    class ProjectProfilesController < ApplicationController
      def edit
        @project_profile = Project.find(params[:project_id]).project_profile
      end
      def update
        @project_profile = Project.find(params[:project_id]).project_profile
    
        respond_to do |format|
          if @project_profile.update_attributes(params[:project_profile])
            format.html {}
          else
            format.html { render :action => ""edit"" }
          end
        end
      end
    end

The following code is from **_form.html.erb**

    <%= form_for @project_profile, :url => ""/projects/#{params[:project_id]}/profile/update"" do |f| %>
        <div class=""field"">
          <%= f.label :title %>

- If I use **<% form_for :project_profile %>**, it doesn't give me an error, but the form is actually not working.

- If I use **<% form_for @project_profile %>**, I will get an error: undefined method `project_profile_path' for #<#<Class:0x00000103549030>:0x00000103546d80>

--------------------------------------------------

You can refer to the following codes to understand the context of my problem better.

I have a project model and a project_profile model. One project has one project_profile.

The following two lines are from my *routes.rb*.

    match '/projects/:project_id/profile/edit' => ""project_profiles#edit""
    match '/projects/:project_id/profile/update' => ""project_profiles#update""

This is from my project_profiles_controller.rb

    class ProjectProfilesController < ApplicationController
      def edit
        @project_profile = Project.find(params[:project_id]).project_profile
      end
      def update
        @project_profile = Project.find(params[:project_id]).project_profile
    
        respond_to do |format|
          if @project_profile.update_attributes(params[:project_profile])
            format.html {}
          else
            format.html { render :action => ""edit"" }
          end
        end
      end
    end

The following code is from **_form.html.erb**

    <%= form_for @project_profile, :url => ""/projects/#{params[:project_id]}/profile/update"" do |f| %>
        <div class=""field"">
          <%= f.label :title %>
          <br/>
          <%= f.text_field :title %>

In my case, the generated image paths don't even include a (jpg|png|gif) file name, I just get really long ids like this:

    <img src=""/media/BAhbB1sHOgZmSSIdNGQ4MTEyOGU3ZjViZmQwZTQ4MDAwMDAyBjoGRVRbCDoGcDoKdGh1bWJJIg0yMDB4MjAwIwY7BlQ"" />

Which get rendered alright, but which I can't figure how to find in a Cucumber/Capybara step :P

Any ideas?

My question is, what is the best practice for storing this token? It's surely not advisable to make two requests every time, one for the token and one for the actual request?

I was considering storing it in a session variable but this would mean generating a new token for each visitor, which I presume is not necessary. However, it would mean I could set a 20 minute expiry on it very easily though.

If I store it in the database, how would I know whether or not it will have expired before making the call to the API, without a lot of extra logic?

Or, should I store it in the database and simply make a background call to the API every few minutes to ensure the token never expires?

Since I'm changing quite a bit, I've put the code into a [paste](http://pastebin.com/wLjskf2G).

There are a few things to note before going into the paste:

 1. One of the original partials receives a collection from it's ""parent"" partial, while the other receives the object directly from the controller.
 2. The `if` statement in both of these ""child"" partials uses a different object name, but they're represent the same object in the database.

Ideally, I'd like to move the `if` statement into the grandchild, or sub-sub-, partial. I can leave it in the child partial if need be, but this doesn't feel DRY.

I've tried rendering the grandchild partial with `<%= render partial: 'shared/foo', object: bar, as: :baz %>` so I can use `baz` in the grandchild partial, since the other child partial uses `baz` by default. In that partial, I'm just doing `<%= render partial: 'shared/foo', object: baz %>`. Confused? Me, too.

You'll notice I've tried rendering the partials both with and without passing in the parent object. Maybe the parent object needs to be redefine? I also just tried `<%= render partial: 'shared/micropost_delete_link', object: feed_item %>`, but no luck.

Each approach I've tried so far yields the same error in the tests:

     Failure/Error: before { visit root_path }
     ActionView::Template::Error:
       undefined method `user' for :feed_item:Symbol

I want my rails app to use British Summer Time (like daylight savings in the US) for the timestamps set in updated_at and created_at in my models.  I changed my environment.rb to say 

      config.time_zone = 'London'

The ubuntu server my app is on seems to use BST for it's time: in the command line, for example, if i type 'date' i get the current time (not offset by an hour).  In the rails console, i see the following:

    >> time = Time.now
    => Wed Oct 27 16:29:17 +0100 2010
    >> time.zone
    => ""BST""

All fine.  However, if i make a new AR model object and save it, the timestamps are from an hour ago.  So, it looks like this is using UTC.  Now, i can see the logic in this: since the timestamps might be used in the model logic, you want them to be based on an unvarying yardstick time, ie UTC.   But, this is a weird bit of behaviour that i don't understand:

    #change a record and save it

    #however, Time.now - object's updated at is just a few seconds.
    >> Time.now - someobj.updated_at
    => 15.305549

So, before doing the subtraction, updated_at is converted into the current time zone.  

The reason i want to show the date in the current time zone is just for status reports etc in the views: if someone updates something i want them to see that it was updated '1 minute ago' not 'one hour ago'.

    #however, Time.now - object's updated at is just a few seconds.
    >> Time.now - someobj.updated_at
    => 15.305549

So, before doing the subtraction, updated_at is converted into the current time zone.  

The reason i want to show the date in the current time zone is just for status reports etc in the views: if someone updates something i want them to see that it was updated '1 minute ago' not 'one hour ago'.

Can anyone unconfuse me?  cheers, max

I need to have following scenario:

 1. User follows the link http://example.com/articles#/?tags=Mac%20OS
 2. Server parses hash-part and returns ""Mac OS""-related articles
 3. Client understands, that ""Mac OS""-articles are already here and does nothing. It just marks ""Mac OS"" tag as selected.

To do this, i need to get hash-part of the request string:

… tags ""Mac OS"" and ""review"" should already been selected in a search form and articles, related to ""Mac OS"" and ""review"" should be presented on the page.

I have following scenario, that a need to fix

 1. User follows the link http://example.com/articles#/?tags=Mac%20OS
 2. During initial page rendering, all articles will be fetched
 3. On the client side, hash-part will be parsed and only ""Mac OS""-related articles will be requested via AJAX
 4. Those ""Mac OS""-articles will be received by the client and will replace all articles, fetched at step 2

The problem here - is duplicated articles rendering, that looks really bad for the user. He looks at all articles, and after couple of seconds, they will be replaced with ""Mac OS""-articles.

I need to have following scenario:

 1. User follows the link http://example.com/articles#/?tags=Mac%20OS
 2. Server parses hash-part and returns ""Mac OS""-related articles
 3. Client understands, that ""Mac OS""-articles are already here and does nothing. It just marks ""Mac OS"" tag as selected.

To do this, i need to get hash-part of the request string:

    /?tags=Mac%20OS

I cannot use request parameters after ?, because i use AJAX and deep-linking. With ?-part, browser will be forced to reload the page. I need to do anything without reloading the page.


You help will be greatly appreciated.

i have a customer model created by a scaffold and pumping it up. a customer has to be displayed in a google map, so if go to /customers/23, the customer information are displayed. additionally i have a link within this page to show the user in a map (with a query ui dialog that comes up via ajax).
The question for me is, how does this fits in the normal crud structure of the model. Should i do like creating an action, called ""show_map"" and give it an extra route additionally to the resources routes? How do you handle this kind of things?

Coming from .net my web applications are never 1 project which is everything, I tend to at least have a data layer project which deals with persisting entities to the database and making these models represent said *entity* in a DB friendly manner. Then I have my UI project which has its own models which are a representation of the entity for the UI, which may have validation based information and will most likely be a more cut down model only exposing what is needed.

So the main point I am trying to get out here is that although we may have a User entity, the models to represent that may be slightly different in the UI and Data layers...

Now fast forwarding to rails, you create your project and it comes with database connectivity (which I believe can be swapped out to any flavour you want), and validation and a whole manner of other frameworks and functionality. This then seems to imply that I no longer need 2 projects, just 1 as its all included within here and all done for me, so all I need to worry about are making my models.

This is the part where I am a little confused, as lets say I am using ActiveRecord I will need to make my model and inherit from ActiveRecord::Base, then I will need to setup how this model connects to other models etc, so I have my model's data concerns sorted, now I need to setup my UI concerns, about validation and string lengths etc... now where do these go... I am assuming on the same model, but then a model isnt just a simple representation of data, its a blob of *stuff* containing concerns for databases and views and who knows what else.

It just seems a little odd to put everything within this one place. I know in .net there are plenty of examples where with large object graph representations in the DB the data models are VERY different to UI models, so is it wise to couple them into one model this way, or is Ruby and its frameworks so flexible in this area that you do not have these same problems? If so is there some example or article which can solidify in my mind how you sidestep the normal problems that cause you to separate your concerns to have maintainable code...

I know in .net there are plenty of examples where with large object graph representations in the DB the data models are VERY different to UI models, so is it wise to couple them into one model this way, or is Ruby and its frameworks so flexible in this area that you do not have these same problems? If so is there some example or article which can solidify in my mind how you sidestep the normal problems that cause you to separate your concerns to have maintainable code... ",4

    hi


I both reloaded and restarted apache2 to make sure the new settings were loaded.

Before I redirected root to `home#index` the default home page would load, but all images were missing and clicking ""about your rails deployment"" resulted in an error.

What did I mess up?

Thanks!

However, if I do a request on this action via ajax, it kicks me out. I find this incredibly strange. If I add a `before_filter` to skip authentication, I no longer get kicked out, but I of course don't want to skip authentication.

    Company has many Users
    User belongs to Company

The User is managed for authentication with devise

    class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    
      belongs_to :company
    
      devise :database_authenticatable, :registerable, :recoverable, :rememberable, :trackable, :validatable

You can login as a User and create Objects that all belong to the Company of that, not to the user, for example: `Text`. (`company.texts`)


now i created a simple API using the `acts_as_api` gem.
for this i simply have to modify my text-controller, f.e. the show action.

    class TextsController < ApplicationController
      
      load_and_authorize_resource
    
      def show
        #@text = Text.find(params[:id])

          format.html
          format.json { render_for_api :texts_all, :json => @text }
        end

this works quite fine on the website.
the problem is the API. i don't want to authenticate when accessing the api via the user model. the company does have a attribute called `:hash`which i want to use for Auth in the API.

i don't have any idea how to achieve this using devise (or any other method).
so by default devise wants a user to be logged in because of `load_and_authorize_resource` in my controller which is fine for the html response but not for the json response.

any ideas?

The User is managed for authentication with devise

    class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    
      belongs_to :company
    
      devise :database_authenticatable, :registerable, :recoverable, :rememberable, :trackable, :validatable

You can login as a User and create Objects that all belong to the Company of that, not to the user, for example: `Text`. (`company.texts`)


now i created a simple API using the `acts_as_api` gem.
for this i simply have to modify my text-controller, f.e. the show action.

    class TextsController < ApplicationController
      
      load_and_authorize_resource
    
      def show
        #@text = Text.find(params[:id])
        respond_to do |format|
          format.html
          format.json { render_for_api :texts_all, :json => @text }
        end

this works quite fine on the website.
the problem is the API. i don't want to authenticate when accessing the api via the user model. the company does have a attribute called `:hash`which i want to use for Auth in the API.

i don't have any idea how to achieve this using devise (or any other method).
so by default devise wants a user to be logged in because of `load_and_authorize_resource` in my controller which is fine for the html response but not for the json response.

any ideas?

thanks for reading this. please leave a comment if something is unclear!",5

**Background**: I am working on a system to manage the review process of academic journals. This process is something like this:

 1. User submits a Submission that contains a Version. The Submission contains all the stuff that only needs to be input once (title, cover letter), while the Version is the actual paper being submitted for consideration.

 2. One or more Reviewers is allocated to a Submission.

 3. Each Reviewer assigned to a Submission then writes a Review for that particular Submission, which encompasses a decision (accept/reject) and some feedback.
 
 4. Based on the Review(s), an Admin sets the status of the Submission (accept/reject).

 5. the User can then choose to submit a new Version for consideration and the process is repeated from step 2.

**Question**:

So firstly, Submissions has_many Versions belongs_to a Submission, which I have implemented and it works fine.

I'm wondering exactly how the rest of it should be structured. Could those of you more experience share your thoughts on what I think I am meant to do next?

 - I initially thought a Submission has_many Reviewers. But it seems it should actually be the other way around --- Reviewer is assigned many Submissions. To illustrate, it's a bit like giving individual Reviewers permission to comment on specific posts. Is this a normal has_many relationship? I've been reading http://guides.rubyonrails.org/association_basics.html and it seems like it could also be a has_and_belongs_to_many.

 - Each Version has many Reviews, therefore Version has_many Reviews and Review belongs_to Version. Additionally, I guess Review should have some reviewer_id kind if field so we know who wrote it.

As an aside, I don't want to be too needy, but it would be absolutely fantastic if someone could provide some insight into the few lines of Reviewer controller code necessary for an admin to assign him/her to a Submission.

- Should I install ruby, and consequently all of gems for the app using sudo, or should i use rvm? If there are no costs for an rvm install, I think that would be preferred as that has greater flexibility, but is using rvm a good solution for a production server? I really have no idea about this
- Should I use nginx/unicorn, or nginx/passenger, or apache/passenger, or something else?
- I would need a scalable database, so probably postgres would be better than mysql. Or should I go along with something else, or change my preference here?

One related question, though not related to this post directly: I typically always install one ruby system-wide using sudo, and install packages like libssl or whatever, and then install the others using rvm without sudo.

I am not sure whats causing it and how to overcome it. I have a feeling that bundle is not able to detect the gems I have already installed.

I also tried out the following command: bundle exec rake db:create. It says it could not find the gem , although I have already installed it. The error I get is given below:

    mohnish@pc146724-desktop:~/Diaspora/diaspora$ bundle exec rake db:create

To choose the items I have some criteria that are attributes of my item (let's say ""category"", ""size"" and ""weight"").
Each of these criteria have a score (let's say 15 for category, 8 for size and 3 for weight).

My idea to find then ten best items to link with the current was something like that :

- Get an array with all combinations of the criteria possible ordered by score. In this case I should have : 
[['category', 'size', 'weigth'], ['category','size'], ['category', 'weight'], ['category'], ['size', 'weight'], ['size'], ['weight] ]   ( the corresponding scores are : 26, 23, 18, 15, 11, 8, 3 )

- Then make a unique request with all the combinations in order with a UNION between each combination and a limit 10 at the end.

(Select *

I have tested this request and it seems to work well. The idea is that the important requests are the first so the results of the firsts requests are in the top and the limit 10 will just keep the most relevant results. But in telling that I have some doubt it can works on other database (it works on mysql but i'm not sure it will work with PostGreSQL). What do you think of that?

- And that's it I can link the results with my current item.

    @map = GMap.new(""div_map"")
    @map.control_init(:large_map => true, :map_type => true)

###Highlights so far:

 - Switching to Heroku's Cedar stack from Bamboo: `heroku create --stack cedar`.
 - Switching to ""thin"" as the production server, which fixed various issues: `gem 'thin'`.
 - Moving my assets from `public/assets` to `app/assets`, updating references in code to use `stylesheet_link_tag` and `javascript_include_tag`. (Plus whatever I did for images -- they work.)
 - Removing x_sendfile_header config options because [Heroku doesn't support it][1].

  [1]: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7597812/image-showing-as-blank-in-rails-3-1-on-production-heroku

###What I think my problem is...

Things are going pretty well, but I'm getting errors that I believe are resulting from .css and .js *not* being precompiled. However, I tried to fix that by adding to `config/application.rb`:  
    
    config.assets.precompile << '*.js'  
    config.assets.precompile << '*.css'

But that didn't do anything as far as I can tell. I don't want to include all my .css and .js files in the manifests of `app/assets/*/application/*.*` just yet -- I still want them as individual files.

###Evidence:
When I check the contents of `public/assets` on my server, the only .css and .js files that I are `application.*`. The rest of the files are images, so at least those are working?!

###Question:
How do you ask sprockets to recursively copy everything (except `application.*`, which is being precompiled and placed just fine) from `app/assets/stylesheets` and `app/assets/javascript` to `public/assets`?

I have a method that makes deleting selected messages possible. The messages don't actually get deleted. Their sender_status or recipient_status columns get set to 1 depending on what user is the sender or recipient of the message.

Anyway if both users have those status's set to one then that last line makes sure the message  row is completely moved from the database. Now this is fine as long as it's not the parent message being deleted. If the parent message deleted then the children that haven't been selected for deletion won't be accessible anymore.

Here is the method:

            def delete_all_users_selected_messages(message_ids, user_id, parent_id)
              Message.where(:id => message_ids, :sender_id => user_id).update_all(:sender_status => 1)
              Message.where(:id => message_ids, :recipient_id => user_id).update_all(:recipient_status => 1)
              Message.delete_all(:sender_status => 1, :recipient_status => 1, :parent_id => parent_id).where(""id != ?"", parent_id)
            end

It's quite obvious what I'm trying to do. I need to have the parent ignored. So where the primary key is equal to the parent_id means that row is a parent (normally the parent_id is nil but I needed it set to the primary keys value for some other reason, long story and not important). Anyway is there an SQL statement I can add on to the end of the last line in tat method? To make sure it only deletes messages where the id of the row is not equal to the parent_id?

I can arrange for the parent_id row to never be permitted for deletion unless the actual thread (MessageThreads table that references the messages tables conversations) is deleted.

Any way how can I make it so this parent row is ignored when that delete_all method is run?

Kind regards

> /usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/ffi-1.0.11/lib/ffi.rb:11:in
> `require': ffi_prep_cif failed.  status=0x2 (fatal)

I can however still run my tests via `bundle exec rspec spec/requests/static_pages_spec.rb`.  Now if I use the gem `gem 'rb-inotify', '0.8.8'` as I'm supposed to according to [this Ruby on Rails tutorial][3], and try to run my tests, they fail with the same error as above (ffi_prep_cif failed). 

When I do a ls on `/usr/local/lib`, I see a few `libffi` files. Could this be a problem? Can anyone explain what's going on here & why `rb-inotify` is acting up?

So for example: personal information (first_name, last_name) go into the Account model while username/ email, password etc go into the User model.

Is this the common approach for most situations? I am trying to understand why there are two models involved. In most situations, shouldn't having a User model be enough? What is the benefit of having an Account model as well?

The problem is, that the first one from nofxx works well, but it doesn't provide rake tasks, so that the postgis.sql and spatial_ref_sys.sql get inserted into the database. I need this, because it's comfortable and essential using tests (create automatically the database, insert the postgis sql and perform the migrations when running ""rake test""). The strange thing is, that in the README on github the author writes something about PostGIS helpers and rake tasks. But they are not implemented (or I'm blind).

The second gem listed above provides this functionality for rake perfectly! But I ran into an issue that I can't solve. I followed the instructions in the README, but everytime when I try to set a position on a spatial column, i get the following output:

As you can see, I set a location using WKT (well known text), but it's always nil. I also tried to save it to the database, but it's also nil.
I figured out, that when I try to use the Objects provided by RGeo

    RGeo::Geos.factory.point(-122, 47)

it says, that the factory is nil. So, there must be a problem by creating the factory provided by RGeo. As mentioned in the README of the activerecord-postgis-adapter I used the following line in my Venue model to provide this support:

    self.rgeo_factory_generator = RGeo::Geos.factory_generator

but it doesn't work.

So to find a solution, there are two ways: Finding a way to get the rake tasks into the georuby gem of nofxx, or solve the problem with the factory of the activerecord-postgis-adapter.

it says, that the factory is nil. So, there must be a problem by creating the factory provided by RGeo. As mentioned in the README of the activerecord-postgis-adapter I used the following line in my Venue model to provide this support:

    self.rgeo_factory_generator = RGeo::Geos.factory_generator

but it doesn't work.

So to find a solution, there are two ways: Finding a way to get the rake tasks into the georuby gem of nofxx, or solve the problem with the factory of the activerecord-postgis-adapter.

Hope someone can help me,
thx!",5

Basically what i want to do is make a simple simulation where there are rounds.

I have a rails app which has a blog integrated into it, and I'd like to put that blog on a subdomain. Ie. `blog.myapp.com`.

Now, within the blog I want the user to be able to view posts, `blog.myapp.com/posts/123`. However, if the user were to click to any other resources on the site, say `videos` for example, I'd like them to be redirected back to root, ie. `www.myapp.com/videos/123`. I don't want `blog.myapp.com/videos...` to cause a routing error, I just want it to redirect.

Basically, I'm looking for the simplest way to setup a subdomain and specify that certain controllers use that subdomain and the others don't. Ideally I'd even like the controller layer to handle redirection both ways, so that in views I could link back and forth to things just using helpers like `post_path(123)` and `video_path(123)` and that the subdomain would automatically be used or not used based on which controller was serving the view.

I tried putting all the controllers in a constraints block, ie:

	constraints :subdomain => 'www' do

		resources :users
		resources :videos

    user PUT   /users/:id(.:format)            {:controller=>""users"", :action=>""update""}
    user DELETE /users/:id(.:format)           {:controller=>""users"", :action=>""destroy""}

This is what I expect.

However when I try to access the following routes via a browser

    /users/137
    /users/137/edit

I get the following error in the logs

    AbstractController::ActionNotFound (The action '137' could not be found for UsersController):
      actionpack (3.0.0) lib/abstract_controller/base.rb:114:in `process'
      actionpack (3.0.0) lib/abstract_controller/rendering.rb:40:in `process'
      ...

What is interesting is that the following paths do work

    /users/show/137
    /users/edit/137

Also if I add the following to the routes.rb file in the application that is requiring the gem it all works as expected.

    resources :users

Is there something I am missing or is this a bug?

Note that I am also doing the following when I start my application
on the command line when I start the rails I set the following env variable

    RAILS_RELATIVE_URL_ROOT=""/my_app""

and in config.ru

    map '/my_app' do
      run MSEL::Application
    end

Googling it it points to Omniauth problem - but I havent changed much (if any) of the omniauth stuff, and had it working last time I deployed it to heroku. 

I have it deployed on a cedar stack btw. 

Any ideas what the problem could be?

so, I have multiple ways of calling my apps API, the following works in the command line:

    curl -H 'Content-Type: application/xml' -d '<object><name>Test API object</name><password>password</password><description>This is a test object</description></object>' ""http://acme.example.dev/objects.xml?api_key=1234""

the above command generates the following request in the devlog:

    Processing ObjectsController#create to xml (for 127.0.0.1 at 2011-07-07 09:17:51) [POST]
      Parameters: {""format""=>""xml"", ""action""=>""create"", ""api_key""=>""1234"", ""controller""=>""objects"", 
      ""object""=>{""name""=>""Test API object"", ""description""=>""This is a test object"", ""password""=>""[FILTERED]""}}

Now, I'm trying to write tests for the actions using the API, to make sure the API works, as well as the controllers.
Here is my current (broken) httparty command:

      response = post(""create"", :api_key => SharedTest.user_api_key, :xml => data, :format => ""xml"")

this command generates the following request in the testlog:

    Processing ObjectsController#create to xml (for 0.0.0.0 at 2011-07-07 09:37:35) [POST]
      Parameters: {
    		""xml""=>""<object><name><![CDATA[first post]]></name>
    					<description><![CDATA[Things are not as they used to be]]></description>
    					<password><![CDATA[WHEE]]></password>

    				""api_key""=>""the_hatter_wants_to_have_tea1"", 
    				""action""=>""create"", 
    				""controller""=>""objects

So, as you can see, the command line command actually generates the object hash from the xml, whereas the httparty command ends up staying in xml, which causes problems for the create method, as it needs a hash.

Thanks",ruby-on-rails,response,ajax,object,,,open,0,931,11,"find(:all) and than add data from another table to the object I have two tables:

    create_table ""friendships"", :force => true do |t|
        t.integer  ""user1_id""
        t.integer  ""user2_id""
        t.boolean  ""hasaccepted""

        t.string   ""lastname""
        t.date     ""birthday""
    end

I need to show the user a list of `Friendrequests`, so I use this method in my controller:

    def getfriendrequests
        respond_to do |format|
            case params[:id]
                when ""to_me""
                    @friendrequests = Friendship.find(:all, :conditions => { :user2_id => session[:user], :hasaccepted => false })
                when ""from_me""
                    @friendrequests = Friendship.find(:all, :conditions => { :user1_id => session[:user], :hasaccepted => false })
            end
            format.xml  { render :xml  => @friendrequests }
            format.json { render :json => @friendrequests }
        end
    end

I do nearly everything using AJAX, so to fetch the First and Last name of the user with UID `user2_id` (the `to_me` param comes later, don't worry right now), I need a for loop which make multiple AJAX calls. This sucks and costs much bandwidth. So I'd rather like that `getfriendrequests` also returns the First and Last name of the corresponding users, so, e.g. the JSON response would not be:

    [
      {
        ""friendship"": {
          ""created_at"": ""2010-02-19T13:51:31Z"",
          ""user1_id"": 2,
          ""updated_at"": ""2010-02-19T13:51:31Z"",
          ""hasaccepted"": false,
          ""id"": 11,
          ""user2_id"": 3
        }
      },
      {
        ""friendship"": {
          ""created_at"": ""2010-02-19T16:31:23Z"",
          ""user1_id"": 2,

          ""hasaccepted"": false,
          ""id"": 12,
          ""user2_id"": 4
        }
      }
    ]  

but rather:

    [
      {
        ""friendship"": {
          ""created_at"": ""2010-02-19T13:51:31Z"",

This is a problem because I'm using precompiled assets, and Capistrano has to run `rake assets:precompile` on the server. That will fail unless the assets gems are installed.

I can work around this problem by manually running `bundle install` within the correct release directory. But obviously this isn't the proper workflow.

Here's the full command Capistrano is executing to install the gems on each deploy:

Here's the end, which I think might be part of the problem:

Evidently, these flags cause Bundler to install without the `:assets` group. What is the expected behavior here? Is what I'm seeing out of the ordinary? (I'm guessing so, since it doesn't make sense for Capistrano to deliberately refrain from installing a gem group that it's about to use.)

As a side note, I also note this line in `application.rb`:

    Bundler.require(*Rails.groups(:assets => %w(development test)))

Unfortunately the LDAP server is not under my control, I know nothing about it's configuration.

Thanks that, a colleague send me his `.htaccess` file(under a PHP site root dir), with the following content:

    AuthType        Basic
    AuthName        ""* Password Domain""
    AuthBasicProvider ldap
    AuthzLDAPAuthoritative on
    AuthLDAPURL ldap://*.*.com:389/ou=active,ou=employees,ou=people,o=*.com?uid?sub
    require valid-user

Note that some sensitive contents are replaced with asteriks(`*`);

And my rails app together with his PHP site locate inside our company, also the LDAP server.

Then it calls .id on whatever artist object is left. That is the resulting artist_id which is used to create the artisanship association.

1) What is happening when I call Artist.create(:name => $1) from inside the post model? 

2) Does that request then go to the create method inside the artist controller?

I understand a normal post request would go to the postscontroller#create method and then write to the database and then redirect to whatever path is in the in the create method such as post_path, so it hits the postscontroller#show and then to the view. Correct?

3) What is the sequence of request from controller to model to view that I'm doing when I call Artist.create! from the artist_tokens=(ids) method inside the post model?

    class CustomFailure < Devise::FailureApp
      def redirect_url 
        signin_path
      end
    
      def respond
        if http_auth? 
          http_auth
        else
          redirect
        end
      end
    end

Could someone tell me how to modify the code to have redirect paths for user signin failed and admin_user signin failed. My admin user signin path is : `admin_user_session_path`

This allows for some nice resume like functionality for uploading to S3.  From another question i got this nice link: [Rails 3 & Plupload][1]

My question is does anyone have any examples where they used the plupload chunking feature with the Amazon multipart feature?  Ideally with carrierwave & fog.

I can see it doing the following:

 - Generate Unique ID for the upload with plupload,   
   can we do an event when the plupload 
   starts?
 - Attaching an ajax request to 
   the chunk completed with the ID
 - Having ajax controller method on the 
   server which uploads to s3 using the 
   ID

This allows for some nice resume like functionality for uploading to S3.  From another question i got this nice link: [Rails 3 & Plupload][1]

My question is does anyone have any examples where they used the plupload chunking feature with the Amazon multipart feature?  Ideally with carrierwave & fog.

I can see it doing the following:

 - Generate Unique ID for the upload with plupload,   
   can we do an event when the plupload 
   starts?
 - Attaching an ajax request to 
   the chunk completed with the ID
 - Having ajax controller method on the 
   server which uploads to s3 using the 
   ID
 - when all are complete fire a     
   controller action to reassemble

Now, in new Appointment form, I don't need to have to create a nested form for Course, because there's no new input needed. All I need to do is to create a new child object for Appointment by copying it over from @tutor. So, in my AppointmentController, I have:

     def new
        @appointment   = Appointment.new
        @course = @appointment.build_course(:id => params[:course_id] )    
      end

Is there any way I can copy @course from :new to :create to save this object without making it a part of the form_for appointment?

If I have to use form_for to pass @course, what's the best way to do it? (Trivially, I can create a nested form for course, and pass each attribute of @course to this nested-form, but it seems ridiculous).

Thank you.

 



  ",ruby-on-rails,forms,,,,,open,0,272,14,"Form that allows to pass child objects from one object to another in Rails I have a form_for class A, which includes a nested form for B class. B belongs to A and C polymorphically.

 There are two ways to create B objects:
- either from a nested form within form_for A
- copy from a C object

For a concrete example, assume an Appointment class, which has_one Tutor and has_many Students. Each Tutor has_one Course. An Appointment also has_one Course

When a student goes to a Tutor's show page and request an appointment, we can pass Course_id of the tutor to Appointment form as follow:

What I want to do is to enforce the presence of 'category_ids' on an 'activated' account.

I am doing [Email Only Sign-up][1] - which is important to note, because it is a two-stage process. The first time a user enters their email address, they are sent an activation email - with a link to `Confirmations` controller.

The view for that `Confirmations Controller` has the additional details that need to be validated.

If I just did a regular `validates_presence_of` on the `User` model, then when a user initially submits just an email address - Rails would fail it (which I don't want).

The user should:

 1. Enter email address
 2. Click confirmation/activation link in email
 3. Fill in name, password and select a category.
 4. Submit.

Step #3, Devise enforces presence_of_validation for name & pw. But not my custom item called `category`.

    class User < ActiveRecord::Base
      devise :database_authenticatable, :registerable, :token_authenticatable, :confirmable, :timeoutable, 
             :recoverable, :rememberable, :trackable, :validatable,
                     :email_regexp =>  /^([^@\s]+)@((?:[-a-z0-9]+\.)+[a-z]{2,})$/i
    
      attr_accessible :email, :password, :password_confirmation, :remember_me, :name, :confirmed_at, :confirmation_token, :category_ids
        validates_uniqueness_of :email, :case_sensitive => false
        validates_confirmation_of   :password
    
    end

What I want to do is to enforce the presence of 'category_ids' on an 'activated' account.

I am doing [Email Only Sign-up][1] - which is important to note, because it is a two-stage process. The first time a user enters their email address, they are sent an activation email - with a link to `Confirmations` controller.

The view for that `Confirmations Controller` has the additional details that need to be validated.

If I just did a regular `validates_presence_of` on the `User` model, then when a user initially submits just an email address - Rails would fail it (which I don't want).

The user should:

 1. Enter email address
 2. Click confirmation/activation link in email
 3. Fill in name, password and select a category.
 4. Submit.

Step #3, Devise enforces presence_of_validation for name & pw. But not my custom item called `category`.

How do I do that?

Thanks.

**The Asset Pipeline - Overview**

*For details on the purpose, benefits, and inner workings of the pipeline, start with this guide: http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html  I will only summarize the bits relevant to my purposes here.*

The reasons the pipeline is necessary are:

 1. **Compilation** - To compile high-level languages (ERb, Haml, Sass, LESS, CoffeeScript...) into plain CSS/JS.

The additional benefits of the pipeline are:

 1. **Concatenation** - Combining multiple files into one to improve client performance.
 2. **Minification** - Removing whitespace and other clever optimizations to reduce file size.
 3. **Fingerprinting** - Added an MD5 hash of the file contents to the filename to force caches to **fetch the file again when it changes.

**The Asset Pipeline - Default Filesystem Layout**

 - `/app|lib|vender/assets/` - Intended for files which will be processed by the pipeline.
 - `/app/assets/` - Intended specifically for files you created for your application.
 - `/lib/assets/` - Intended specifically for files you created for sharing across multiple applications.
 - `/vendor/assets/` - Intended specifically for files created by others, such as jQuery and Twitter Bootstrap (though they are frequently provided by gems instead of being imported directly into /vender).
 - `/public/` - Files in here are left as is, and fetchable directly from the root path ('/') of your web app.

    puts m = Message.find(m.id)
    puts m.update_attribute(:title, ""name"")

This works up until the update_attribute, which is actually getting the proper non-nested url and it's making a PUT request that fails.

Why doesn't this work for update? How do I handle the different parent resources in a better manner?

Any tips would be awesome. :)

I have a full time gig but recently someone I know wanted to get an application done that would send mass emails/texts to users who are related to a particular group.

 - Login
 - CRUD Groups
 - CRUD Users (related to groups)
 - CRUD Notifications (email / sms)
 - Screens for displaying when last notification was sent to a particular group etc. 
 - Unsubscribe link in the emails pointing back to the application
 - be on https
 - set up the whole app on their network (Windows server)
 - Code will belong to him
 - NDA signed
 - finished in 3-4 weeks

Now, I have an API integration with a third party site that works through the User Model, but some of the information for that API link is contained in Profile, so I have an ""after_update"" filter on Profile that tells the parent user to save, which triggers an update of the API.

I'm trying to write a test for this, and I'm getting an ActiveRecord::AssociationTypeMismatch. The reason is I'm using a mock user, but I'm trying to test that when Profile is updated it sends :save to User. Plus, the User model has an email confirmation process and the afformentioned API calls in it's create process, so it really isn't ideal to actually create a user just to test this out.

Here's my test:

	it ""should save the parent user object after it is saved"" do
		user = double('user', :save => true )
		profile = Profile.create( :first_name => 'John', :last_name => 'Doe' )
		profile.user = user
		
		user.should_receive(:save)

So, clearly the ActiveRecord error is being caused by trying to associate a mock user with a profile that expects a real user to be associated.

I have an XML file and are using the Nokogiri gem.

The XML looks like this (imagine if you will an infinite amount of 'variants'):

    <?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?> 
    <products> 
        <variant> 
            <sku type=""string"">123abc</sku>
            <inventory-quantity type=""integer"">68</inventory-quantity> 
        </variant> 
        <variant> 
            <sku type=""string"">321cba</sku>
            <inventory-quantity type=""integer"">22</inventory-quantity> 
        </variant>
    </products>

I want to loop over the variants and create a corresponding record for each that contains the 'sku' and 'inventory-quantity' attributes. 

This is what I've got so far, but instead of creating individual records, in the above case it creates two records and inserts the complete array or NodeSet that Nokogiri returns into each records attribute. So this:

    doc = Nokogiri::XML(File.open(""#{Rails.root}/public/new.xml"")) 
      
    variant = doc.xpath(""//variant"")
      
    variant.each do |product| 
            
      sku = product.xpath(""//sku"").text
      quan = product.xpath(""//inventory-quantity"").text
            
      Productmapping.create(:sku => sku, :product_quantity => quan)
            
    end

creates this...

    sku              inventory-quantity

    123abc321cba     6822
    123abc321cba     6822

Where I actually want:

    sku              inventory-quantity

    123ab            68
    321cba           22


It looks like it's because the xpath locator returns all occurrences into an array and I'm calling that array and inserting it for each record.

Thanks!

So a user (created by FactoryGirl) buys something from my site.

The `should create a stripe customer and save that to the stripe_customer_id of the user` is failing (`@user.stripe_customer_id` is `nil`).

The controller has this method:

    def confirmation
      @cart = current_cart
      customer = Stripe::Customer.create(description: current_user.email, card: params[:stripeToken])
      current_user.update_attributes(stripe_customer_id: customer.id)
    end

I know the current_user (the same user from FactoryGirl for the tests) is being updated with the `stripe_customer_id` because the other tests are working.

I assumed I would have to update the model somehow, because I was directly affecting the database (@user and current_user reference the same db entry, but are not the same object).  So I tried calling `@user.reload` before checking if the `stripe_customer_id` was nil, but the test still failed.

2 questions: Should I even be checking model attributes in a request spec? And, is there a way I can get the failing test to pass?

Thanks

And oh, the wizard deals with 3 different resources.

I've tried one approach that I'm currently stuck on, and frankly doesn't feel right.

It seems like there is a problem with calling actions from within the same controller.
And based on that I've never seen this be done before, it feels wrong.

What I am trying to accomplish in simple:
I do not want to clutter up the original REST-controllers of resources.
I want every step to be validated
If update_attributes fails, re-render form with errors.
If update_attributes succeed render next step.

I've come to the conclusion that my shot at this will not work, and does not feel like the ""rails-way"" of doing things.

How do I fix this?

For example, if I have the following users @user1 and @user2:

    class User < ActiveRecord::Base
          acts_as_taggable_on :skills, :interests
        end
    
    @user1 = User.new(:name => ""Bobby"")
    @user1.interest_list = ""1, 15""     
    @user1.skill_list = ""2, 17""
    @user1.save
    
    @user2 = User.new(:name => ""Al"")
    @user2.interest_list = ""3, 10""     
    @user2.skill_list = ""4, 6""
    @user2.save

When I want to get all users who's interest-list include any of the tag [""2"", ""50""], i tried this:

    User.tagged_with([""2"", ""50""], :on => :interests, :any => true)

The problem is I get back @user1 (which has ""2"" in the skill_list, not interest_list), even though I was expecting none. It seems that the flag :any might have overwritten the flag :on. Is there a way to actually perform the filter I described above?

Also, a side question is, how do you find all the flags available to a method? For example, tagged_with has :on, :any, :match_all, ..., how do i list all of them ?

      @user = User.where(username: params[:user]).first
      @user ? @reviews = @reviews.where(user_id: @user.id) : @reviews = nil

But for a polymorphic association I'm lost?

    #@reviews = params[:review_type].constantize if params[:review_type].present? #@reviews.reviewable.where(review_type: params[:review_type])
    
    @reviews = Review.order_by([:updated_at, :desc]).page(params[:page])#.order(sort_column + "" "" + sort_direction)

It works perfectly for the code that does not have ""customer"" appended to it.  The token generates, and I can get the email to send with the same format for the url: /password_resets/<token>/edit_customer

However, it receives an error when I try to pull up the url.  With the code above, I receive this error: ""No route matches {:action=>""show"", :controller=>""password_resets""}"" - I can also see that it interprets the :id to be the id of the controller (which is different than how the user one works - it correctly interprets the id as the token.

I have experimented a lot:

 - change :id in controller for edit_customer in load_customer_using_perishable_token to perishable_token, customer.perishable_token, @customer.perishable_token)
 - tried to append these to ""get 'edit_customer'"" using the path helper (=> ""cust_pass"") - :path, :path_name, :as so i could change the url to cust_pass_path
 - i even tried to add this to the routes just to see if it would work 
match '/password_resets/:id/edit_customer' => 'password_resets#edit_customer'

So I stumped.  Any help would be greatly appreciated!

It works perfectly for the code that does not have ""customer"" appended to it.  The token generates, and I can get the email to send with the same format for the url: /password_resets/<token>/edit_customer

However, it receives an error when I try to pull up the url.  With the code above, I receive this error: ""No route matches {:action=>""show"", :controller=>""password_resets""}"" - I can also see that it interprets the :id to be the id of the controller (which is different than how the user one works - it correctly interprets the id as the token.

I have experimented a lot:

 - change :id in controller for edit_customer in load_customer_using_perishable_token to perishable_token, customer.perishable_token, @customer.perishable_token)
 - tried to append these to ""get 'edit_customer'"" using the path helper (=> ""cust_pass"") - :path, :path_name, :as so i could change the url to cust_pass_path
 - i even tried to add this to the routes just to see if it would work 
match '/password_resets/:id/edit_customer' => 'password_resets#edit_customer'

So I stumped.  Any help would be greatly appreciated!

    ...
    end
    
The problem I encounter occurs when I try to enter a new artist as both a composer and an arranger. For example, say I submit this as a post request

    Parameters: {""Name""=>[""New Album""],
                 ""Performer Names""=>[""New Artist""], 
                 ""Composer Names""=>[""New Artist""], 
                 ""Arranger Names""=>[""New Artist""], 
                 ...
                }

Since the composer arguments are first, rails interprets them properly (as if the artist does not exist). The arranger and performer arguments are also interpreted as if the artist does not exist. Then rails begins inserting data into my database. First the album is created and inserted into the albums table, then ""New Artist"" is created and inserted into album_composer (according to the .build method).

However, for the arranger and performer arguments, the build method can no longer be used, since the artist has been created, so the code is not executed properly. 

I tried to workaround by using the puts method (aka <<) in the arranger and performer argument lines for this specific case, but that doesn't work because it instantly fires without waiting for the artist to be made by the composer argument, resulting in an ""Artist cannot be found"" error.  For Reference:
    
    collection<<(object, …)
    Adds one or more objects to the collection by creating associations in the join table (collection.push and collection.concat are aliases to this method). 
    Note that this operation instantly fires update sql without waiting for the save or update call on the parent object.

When the popup window form is completed, the user clicks a ""Save"" button, the window closes, and the original page reloads to show any updates that happened to the data.

My technique only works sometimes. I can't for the life of me figure out why it works one time and why it doesn't another.

In my popup window's form, I have this as the submit method:

    <%= submit_tag(""Update Invoice"", {:onclick=>""refreshParent()""}) %>

So the Javascript is executed ideally at the same time that the form is submitted to the controller. Here's the refreshParent() Javascript function:

    function refreshParent(id) {
    	window.opener.location.reload();
    	window.close();
    }

Now, the method called by my form (""update"" in this case) doesn't have a redirect_to method call, but even when I do (say, to the original view, index) it doesn't seem to matter.

At root, it seems that my controller method doesn't fire on form submit. Sometimes. I can submit the same form data multiple times, and it'll work the third time. Or sometimes it works right away. It's totally random.

What can I do to ensure that my controller methods fire when you close a popup window?

Thanks,
Aaron.

The `make!` stuff is to do with using machinist fixture replacement. It just factory creates the objects.

The failure occurs on the last line. It turns out that o.veterinarians only has 1 record.

    @person = @event.people.build(params[:person]) 

This all works great.

I'm unsure of what I need to do for the Edit and Update actions though. Googling hasn't yielded any good links.

Here are my models:

    class Event < ActiveRecord::Base
       belongs_to :user
       belongs_to :address
       has_many :people
       accepts_nested_attributes_for :address, :allow_destroy => true
    end

    class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
      belongs_to :event
      belongs_to :address
      accepts_nested_attributes_for :address, :allow_destroy => true
    end

    class Address < ActiveRecord::Base
      belongs_to :person
      belongs_to :event
    end


I basically want to make sure that when I edit a person, AR will update the correct event id and address id along with the person's details.

Thanks!

and

    /discussions/beer/brooklyn-lager

My models are defined as:

    class Discussion
      belongs_to :category

    class Category
      has_many :discussions

I have it working at the moment, but only by hijacking the :index and :show routes of the discussions resource, and using this:

    get ""/discussions/:category"" => ""discussions#index"", :as => :discussions_by_category
    get ""/discussions/:category/:id"" => ""discussions#show"", :as => :discussion

and in the index and show actions of the discussions controller, using the category param to filter the results.

This also requires me to define a 'to_url' function in the Discussion model, which returns a path including the category slug.

Is this really the proper way to accomplish this? It kind of messes up my restfulness, no?

I am trying to move the json into a partial so I can use the same json format from multiple methods (index, search).

&lt;%= render 'results.json.erb', result =&gt; result %&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;

my partial looks like this

I am trying to move the json into a partial so I can use the same json format from multiple methods (index, search). 

I had my results in _listResults.js.erb, and have now moved them into results.json.erb and in _listResults.js.erb I have 
<pre>
[
&lt;% @results.each_with_index do |result, idx| %&gt;
&lt;%= render 'results.json.erb', result =&gt; result %&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;
]
</pre>

my partial looks like this
<pre>
{""result"":&lt;%= result.id %&gt;
,""title"":""&lt;%= result.title %&gt;
.....
</pre>

due to the line breaks, I'm getting an error that says
<pre>
... syntax error, unexpected ',', expecting keyword_end...);@output_buffer.safe_concat(',""title"":');@output_buffer.a...
</pre>

Though I could put the entire json output into one line, and it looks like that would resolve the problem, that would really be a pain to maintain if I want to change the output at a later time. 

What's the best way to deal with this sort of thing.
