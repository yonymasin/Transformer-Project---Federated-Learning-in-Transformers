This works great when I select about 20 files or less, right-click and ""send to"" my batch file script.  However, nothing happens at all when I select more than that.  I suspect there's a character or number of arguments limit somewhere.

(invoking perl script) I'm trying to emulate [RapidCRC][1]'s ability to filename crc32s on Windows Vista Ultimate 64-bit.  However, I seem to be running into some kind of argument limitation.

I wrote a quick perl script, created a batch file to call it, then placed a shortcut to the batch file in `%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\SendTo`

This works great when I select about 20 files or less, right-click and ""send to"" my batch file script.  However, nothing happens at all when I select more than that.  I suspect there's a character or number of arguments limit somewhere.

Hopefully I'm missing something simple and that the solution or a workaround isn't too painful...

Recently, I came across a library for python(scapy), from the [documentation][3], it is able to sniff, and forge traffic, I have some questions about scapy:

what's mean  ""forge network packets"" ? forge a copy of packets?

Thakns in advance.

This `/s` parameter evidently has something to do with some arcane quote handling.

[The docs](http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/cmd.mspx?mfr=true) are confusing, but as far as I can tell, when you do `cmd /c `*`something`*, and the *`something`* contains quotation marks, then by default `cmd` will sometimes strip off those quotes, and `/s` tells it to leave them alone.

What I don't understand is when the quote removal would break anything, because that's the only time `/s` (""suppress the default quote-removal behavior"") would be necessary. It only removes quotes under a certain arcane set of conditions, and one of those conditions is that the first character after the `/c` must be a quotation mark. So it's not removing quotes around arguments; it's either removing quotes around the path to the EXE you're running, or around the entire command line (or possibly around the first half of the command line, which would be bizarre).

* If the path to the EXE is quoted, e.g. `cmd /c ""c:\tools\foo.exe"" arg1 arg2`, then quotes are unnecessary, and if `cmd` wants to remove them, fine. (It won't remove them if the path has a space in the name -- that's another of the arcane rules.) I can't imagine any reason to suppress the quote removal, so `/s` seems unnecessary.
* If the entire command line is quoted, e.g. `cmd /c ""foo.exe arg1 arg2""`, then it seems like quote removal would be a necessity, since there's no EXE named `foo.exe arg1 arg2` on the system; so it seems like opting out of quote removal using `/s` would actually break things. (In actual fact, however, it does not break things: `cmd /s /c ""foo.exe arg1 arg2""` works just fine.)

(Note, I don't mean getting the address of the PC the code is running on, I mean the address of another PC on the LAN!) This has been working in the field as well as in the lab for quite some time but now I have a Windows 7 (32 bit) PC that behaves anomalously.  The hostname for this PC is ""elbow"".

I compiled the sample code provided by Microsoft for getaddrinfo() at http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms738520%28v=vs.85%29.aspx

When I run this sample code on any PC on my LAN and specify ""elbow"" as the hostname, getaddrinfo() returns the loopback address 127.0.0.1 instead of the correct one (192.168.1.110).  However, if I specify any other hostname getaddrinfo() returns the correct address!

At some point in the past ""elbow"" did NOT exhibit this behavior, so clearly something about that PC has changed to cause this behavior.  I have tried restoring the PC disk image to a point where I *think* it did not cause this behavior, but that made no change.

(Note, I don't mean getting the address of the PC the code is running on, I mean the address of another PC on the LAN!) This has been working in the field as well as in the lab for quite some time but now I have a Windows 7 (32 bit) PC that behaves anomalously.  The hostname for this PC is ""elbow"".

I compiled the sample code provided by Microsoft for getaddrinfo() at http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms738520%28v=vs.85%29.aspx

When I run this sample code on any PC on my LAN and specify ""elbow"" as the hostname, getaddrinfo() returns the loopback address 127.0.0.1 instead of the correct one (192.168.1.110).  However, if I specify any other hostname getaddrinfo() returns the correct address!

At some point in the past ""elbow"" did NOT exhibit this behavior, so clearly something about that PC has changed to cause this behavior.  I have tried restoring the PC disk image to a point where I *think* it did not cause this behavior, but that made no change.

1. Open file with mmsioOpen

3. Write audio data using mmioWrite

5. Close file using mmioClose

The file is being written into a temporary location, so after it has been closed it gets copied to another location using the CopyFile.

This program is written in C++ and works great until the file it is writing resides over a WAN in a different city or country.  The end result is a wav file that should be 20-30 seconds long ends up being 4 secodns long.  It is always the last bit that is missing, so when you play it back it just stops before then of the recording.

I initially thought that maybe I was copying the file too soon so as a test I put in a pause of 30 seconds after closing the file using Sleep(30000), but this made no difference to either it being truncated or by how much.

Does anyone have any ideas why this is happening and if there is a work-around to it?

I suspect that I may end up having the temporary location on the local drive, but this is quite a big change to the application as well as existing deployments.

Now I've been trying for days to get this little doodad set as the default browser for my computer. Here's a list of some of the registry keys I've edited. For some reason, Windows is still using IE as the default browser.

    HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Clients\StartmenuInternet  (Default) = DEFAULTBROWSER
    HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\http  (Default) = C:\browserFix.exe
    HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\http\shell\open\command  (Default) = C:\browserFix.exe
    HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\https  (Default) = C:\browserFix.exe
    HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\https\shell\open\command  (Default) = C:\browserFix.exe
    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\http\shell\open\command  (Default) = C:\browserFix.exe
    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\https\shell\open\command  (Default) = C:\browserFix.exe
    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Clients\StartMenuInternet (Default) = DEFAULTBROWSER
    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Clients\StartMenuInternet\DEFAULTBROWSER  (Default) = Default Browser, LocalizedString = C:\browserFix.exe
    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Clients\StartMenuInternet\DEFAULTBROWSER\shell\open\command  (Default) = C:\browserFix.exe
    
If I go to the control panel > programs > default programs > associate a file type or protocol and double click on HTTP or HTTPS, I'm only given the options for Google Chrome and IE. There is no browse option. In the end I'd like to be able to do this programmatically anyway. But to see if I could get it to show up I based these entries off of the ones for Google Chrome.

    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Clients\StartMenuInternet\DEFAULTBROWSER\Capabilities\StartMenu  StartMenuInternet = Default Browser Fixer
    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Clients\StartMenuInternet\DEFAULTBROWSER\Capabilities\URLAssociations  http and https = C:\browserFix.exe

It looks like Windows still isn't even looking at the program as a browser, much less the default one. Can anyone point me in the right direction? Keep in mind that I'd like to be able to do this with an installer batch script in the future.

Thanks in advance!

",windows,windbg,hang,,,11/01/2011 16:46:54,not constructive,1,1780,6,"what is causing this app freeze? My .NET application goes in hang state. I don't see anything on the manages side that can give any clues. I ran !threads command (locks count colulmn is 0 for all threads), nothing out of !syncblk etc. This application does interop and on the native side I see following stacks. Any ideas what is causing application freeze or how to debug this issue?

(Side note, the for loop is just looking up two text files I have and feeding it to an exe that returns a checksum for the file., that seems to works fine, as the ERRORLEVEL is the result of the exe.)

        echo error level: !ERRORLEVEL!

Output:

    seed init val:-1
    Seed in main : FFFFFFFF
    The 32-bit checksum for result.txt is 44DD58EE
    error level: 1155356910   //same as checksum hex value 44DD58EE
    new seed val:-1 //should now be 1155356910
    Seed in main : FFFFFFFF
    The 32-bit checksum for test.txt is E245740F
    error level: -498764785   //same as checksum hex value E245740F
    new seed val:-1

The line that sets seed = ERRORLEVEL does not work.  
to echo the ERRORLEVEL I did need to use the ""!"" otherwise it would not expand and display properly.  

As you can see when we get to new seed value: it is still -1

How do I set `seed` to the last `ERRORVALUE`?

(Side note, the for loop is just looking up two text files I have and feeding it to an exe that returns a checksum for the file., that seems to works fine, as the ERRORLEVEL is the result of the exe.)

How are programs made without it?,"I've been programming for a few years, and I know how to create my own complex methods using pre-existing/standard libraries. I was always wondering (Java for example) how is a JFrame created when creating a JFrame object in Java? How do you use standard code (no libraries) to code a GUI or complex operations like creating files, reading files, etc.

If all these existing methods we use can be compared to building blocks we use to build a pyramid. How are these blocks created in the first place? (I mean technically). A programming language without standard libraries is variables, loops, and math (and even the math functions were created by someone).

The basic question is Does Java or C or any other language (while operating on Windows for example) complete all its operations by calling Windows .dll libraries for creating windows and other complex operations? 

If so, How were these complex operations/methods/functions created in an operating system with just regular variables, loops, etc.

There's a gap in my understanding of programming.
I understand computers read binary (electricity = on/off), someone made assembly/assembler to convert binary to more readable code which moves numbers from different registers in a processor, which can lead to basic math, addition, subtraction, multiplication, divison. The gap in my understanding is the jump from Assembly to a higher language like C that holds variables, does loops, creates GUIS, Operating systems.",windows,api,dll,assembly,operating-system,07/25/2012 12:10:08,not constructive,1,229,15,"Do all windows based programs use the windows API? How are programs made without it? I've been programming for a few years, and I know how to create my own complex methods using pre-existing/standard libraries. I was always wondering (Java for example) how is a JFrame created when creating a JFrame object in Java? How do you use standard code (no libraries) to code a GUI or complex operations like creating files, reading files, etc.

If all these existing methods we use can be compared to building blocks we use to build a pyramid. How are these blocks created in the first place? (I mean technically). A programming language without standard libraries is variables, loops, and math (and even the math functions were created by someone).

The basic question is Does Java or C or any other language (while operating on Windows for example) complete all its operations by calling Windows .dll libraries for creating windows and other complex operations? 

If so, How were these complex operations/methods/functions created in an operating system with just regular variables, loops, etc.
