     2 C2371 'identifier' : redefinition; different basic types

It looks to me like all these errors are symptoms of a failure in the preprocessing stage.

I won't paste the entire output here, but the beginning is:

So given the clue `Stat_t`, I tried to track down the issue.

    ack Stat_t c:\opt\perl512.32\lib\core\

So `Stat_t` is defined in `CORE\dosish.h` and `CORE\unixish.h`. Both are conditionally included from `CORE\perl.h`. Which is included from the file I'm trying to compile. So it *should* work.

Thanks.",windows,perl,visual-c++,build,preprocessor,,open,0,336,13,"Building Perl/C module using Microsoft VC (cl.exe) 2010 (10.0) Express and ActivePerl 5.12.4/32 I'm facing this build problem using the configuration mentioned in the title. The Perl module I'm trying to build is `MongoDB::Connection`. I'm building via the CPAN shell, or manually like this:

    C:\Opt\Perl512.32\bin\perl.exe Makefile.PL
    nmake

The command line for `cl.exe` is:

Here are the error codes and their frequencies:

     6 C2040 'operator' : 'identifier1' differs in levels of indirection
                          from 'identifier2'
    32 C2059 syntax error : 'token'
     7 C2081 'identifier' : name in formal parameter list illegal
    54 C2143 syntax error : missing 'token1' before 'token2'
     2 C2371 'identifier' : redefinition; different basic types

It looks to me like all these errors are symptoms of a failure in the preprocessing stage.

I won't paste the entire output here, but the beginning is:

    c:\opt\perl512.32\lib\core\win32.h(368) : error C2143: Syntaxfehler: Es fehlt ')' vor '*'
    c:\opt\perl512.32\lib\core\win32.h(368) : error C2081: 'Stat_t': Name in der formalen Parameterliste ist ungültig
    c:\opt\perl512.32\lib\core\win32.h(368) : error C2143: Syntaxfehler: Es fehlt '{' vor '*'

    c:\opt\perl512.32\lib\core\win32.h(369) : error C2081: 'STRLEN': Name in der formalen Parameterliste ist ungültig

So given the clue `Stat_t`, I tried to track down the issue.

    ack Stat_t c:\opt\perl512.32\lib\core\

So `Stat_t` is defined in `CORE\dosish.h` and `CORE\unixish.h`. Both are conditionally included from `CORE\perl.h`. Which is included from the file I'm trying to compile. So it *should* work.

I declared success a few days ago, doing the following;

1) Connect PC to pandaboard, using Standard-A to Mini-B USB connector. The Pandaboard remains invisible to the PC (no new device in device manager).

2) On the pandaboard, load the g_ether module. (modprobe g_ether) The Pandaboard becomes visible to the PC (as a USB Ethernet Gadget, IIRC).

3) Install a driver for the device using Linux.inf, which is provided in Linux distributions. The INF file makes reference to a USB8023.sys driver, and the RNDISMP.sys driver. 

After this, I observed that I could ping a IP address that ipconfig reported, but that unplugging the USB cable meant that I couldn't ping that address anymore. I can also still ping that address with the PCs ethernet cable unplugged (I will repeat this test to confirm).

Yesterday a co-worker asked me to clock the connection speed. The method I used was to ping this address with the -l option and very large payload sizes and calculate the speed. It immediately became obvious that **the size of the data packet did not have an effect on the speed** the ping program reported when pinging the pandaboard. I confirmed this observation with the hrping program, which includes a microsecond-precision timer. I also attempted using netperf to clock network speeds, but couldn't get it to work with the pandaboard's IP address.

This is obviously wrong. Either the extra data is being ignored thanks to some quirk of the RNDIS ping handler, or I'm pinging not the pandaboard but an intermediary on my own PC. Has anyone seen this behavior before, or have an explanation?

TIA,<br>

**The exercise is:**

Write a bat-file that displys the contents of text files containing specified with the command word `findstr` for a given type of text files in a specific folder.

My desktop computer that is running Windows Vista tends to freeze on occasions. Freezes last around 5-20 seconds after then, the systems goes back to normal like nothing happened.

I'm creating a new application using the Winapi.  I would like to use the windows 7 style controls such as check boxes and radio buttons.  The issue is that I am also going to be changing the background of my window as well.  The problem is that when I do that all of the controls have a border around them that is the default background color.  This would be fine if I wasn't planning on changing the background color depending on user selections.  Here is an image with it on the non default background.

I know that if I turn off the styling I can make it transparent by processing the WM_CTLCOLORSTATIC, but that message doesn't seem to apply to controls using the windows 7 visual style.

Variant 1 is to check the `OwningThread` field of the `CRITICAL_SECTION` structure, but I wonder whether there is a guarantee that this field is

 - always containing a thread ID from the same number space as `GetCurrentThreadId()` results
 - always updated when any thread takes the lock
 - always cleared when my own thread releases the lock

Variant 2 is to lock the `CRITICAL_SECTION` and then examine the `RecursionCount`; this assumes that the recursion counter has a fixed start value.

Is there anything that I have missed that I could use to build a somewhat future-proof (that is, it will break noisily in a line of code that is near to the comments where I explain it all) assertion statement that the current thread is *not* the holder of a certain `CRITICAL_SECTION`?",windows,multithreading,winapi,hack,critical-section,,open,0,289,10,"Assert that current thread does not hold a CRITICAL_SECTION lock I have an object that maintains a list; one of the helper methods needs to

 - wait on the other thread to finish

The cleanup operation removes the object from the list from the other thread, thus it needs to lock the list in between.

Details:

I'm using the low-level CRT function in Windows (_eof, _read) to communicate with a process that was spawned via a call to _spawnl (with the P_NOWAIT) flag.  I'm using _pipe to create file descriptors to communicate with this spawned process and passing those descriptors (the FD #) to it on the command line.

It is worth mentioning that I don't control the spawned process.  It's a black box to me.

It turns out that the process we are spawning occasionally crashes.  I'm trying to make my code robust to this by detecting the crash.  Unfortunately, I can't see a way to do this.  It seems reasonable to me to expect that a call to _eof or _read on one of those descriptors would return an error status (-1) if the process had died.

Unfortunately, that isn't the case.  It appears that the descriptors have a life of their own independent of the spawned process.  So even though the process on the other end is dead, I get no error status on the file descriptor I'm using to communicate with it.

I've got the PID for the nested process (returned from the _spanwnl call) but I don't see anything I can do with that.  My code works really well except for one thing.  I can't detect whether the spawned process is simply busy computing me an answer or has died.

At this moment, I am able to invoke checkpoint VPN from command line. But when i try to connect, pop-up for smart card pin appears. Once I enter pin, connection is established successfully.
If I disconnect and try to connect for the second time, pop-up for smart card does not appear. It seems that pin information is cached somewhere.
The problem is that I am trying to connect to VPN using batch file and I want to configure pin information somewhere or give the pin information as a argument to batch file. I am not able to find how to configure it.
By the way secure client that i use is ""NGX R60 HFA03 (Build 011)"". Kindly let me know, if you have any i search on how to proceed. Any small hint would be appreciable.

I would interpret VM Size in the Windows Task manager as either the total addressable virtual memory space or the amount of memory the process is currently using in the virtual memory space. 

But in the Task Manager the WM Size is in many cases less than Mem Usage, which should be amount of RAM the process is using. Therefor I guess that WM Size means something else?

i need to split a usb memory in two usb drive, each one with own drive letter, but one of this has to be hidden. In the non-hidden partition i have to place my software, and in the hidden partition i need to place some file that are required by the software to work. Moreover only the software can read,write,delete or execute the files in this partition. I thought to use a little partition viewed as a cd-rom drive, as they do in many, but this solution does not allow to write other data in a second moment, and it's visible to the user that can read the file. Obviously the software must be able to access to partition and read,write,delete or execute the content.

There is a solution to do so, possibly that work also on linux? 
I add also that i already know truecrypt and it's a very good tool, but with the encryption as a file on the visible drive, there is the risk of an accidental delete (for ex formatting the drive). What i need instead is a drive accessible in read/write only from the software but not from the user. Like with linux file permission, the only owner need to be the software without the possibility to change this setting.

I have a discussion on this topic scheduled for mid-August, and I'd like to see how much I'm prepared and how many things I actually got right :) Also, how much more I need to learn on the subject :)

The situation is the following:

There are 5 servers available to me, all with 8 CPU cores and 16 GB of RAM.

I will need to set up an Active Directory environment that will have an Exchange Server member server. Of course, it will only need to be functional for me to send a test message with it and prove the concept, but it should also theoretically be enough to run with 100-200 users.

So here are my thoughts.

I would use only 3 servers, as the load on the would be minimal. 2 for AD and 1 for Exchange.

Since this will be new infrastructure with no legacy servers, why not go with Windows Server 2008 R2 forest and domain functional levels. It will allow a lot of nice features for all users :)

One AD server would be a DC in forest root domain and have all 5 FSMO roles:
AD1 - Schema Master, Domain Naming Master, PDC, RID, Infrastructure Master. I will also install DNS role on AD1.

AD2 will be a secondary DC for the domain and also host DNS in AD integrated zone.

(I think I can make them both Global Catalogs, but in one domain there should be no benefit to it..? If anyone can shed some light on this, it would be great ;)

Third server, EX3, would host the following Exchange roles: Mailbox Server, Hub Transport and Client Access Server. I don't want Unified Messaging role, and I believe I don't need Edge Transport role as well. Please discuss if you believe I'm wrong.

So this is about it. I believe I should not have much problems defending this setup against professor. It will be okay for Exchange server to have 8 CPU and 16 GB RAM, but it would be overkill for AD1 and AD2. I have no solution to this other than virtualization, but this will not be the topic.

How would you carry this out?
How would you spread servers/roles out if you need Exchange in a second domain?

Here is what I've tried so far.

a.) Making sure the privellages are okay.

b.) Mapping both the drives in the third computer and then copying.

c.) Using the program `WatchDirectory (http://www.watchdirectory.net/)` to do that. WatchDirectory is running as a service under my user ID.

d.) The Windows file system is NTFS. Converting that to FAT isn't an option.

Please suggest.

I have another Windows computer with a shared network drive (limited read / write access to my User ID). Its address is 

    \\Windows\Target\

I am using a third windows machine to copy all files from `\\mac\source to \\Windows\Target` as a scheduled task. I couldn't get it working. 

Here is what I've tried so far.

a.) Making sure the privellages are okay.

b.) Mapping both the drives in the third computer and then copying.

c.) Using the program `WatchDirectory (http://www.watchdirectory.net/)` to do that. WatchDirectory is running as a service under my user ID.

d.) The Windows file system is NTFS. Converting that to FAT isn't an option.

Please suggest.

Thanks

There are many drawbacks however: 

1. DWM and Aero cause a massive slowdown (3ms --> 35ms just to call `BitBlt`) -- to work around this would require disabling Aero which I'd just rather not do. The screen flickers and things shift around. 
2. Data must be re-transferred to the GPU in order to load data as texture
3. Layered Windows cannot be captured without `CAPTUREBLT` flag. When enabled, the mouse cursor blinks when capturing.

I've been trying to compile this thing for a while now and I know of the numerous posts floating around the internet offering help. I have read and tried most of the suggestions and wanted to colate my success into this single post for others to benefit from.

Since I don't have a blog, I thought it wouldn't hurt to post on here instead.

I have managed to compile FFMPEG 0.10.3 (Freedom) on Windows 7 (32 bit) using NDK r5 and Cygwin. The steps:

1 - Download/install Cygwin in the root of your C drive. I'm not going to give instructions on this, it's simple enough and there *are* plenty of tutorials on this.

2 - Download NDK r5 from [here][1] and extract to the root of your C drive.

3 - Download FFMPEG 0.10.3 from [here][2] and extract to the root of your C drive.

4 - Open the file 'configure' in the root of the FFMPEG directory in a text editor.

5 - Comment out lines 2073, 2074 and 2075.

6 - Below 2075, add the following line: 

> TMPDIR=c:/cygwin/tmp

7 - Download [this][3] script (thankyou roman10) and place it inside your FFMPEG root directory. Rename the file to 

> build_android.sh

8 - Open the script in a text editor and edit line 17 to read 

> c:/android-ndk-r5

9 - Click start > run and type ""bash"" (without the speech marks) and press enter.

10 - Type the following and press enter: 

> cd /cygdrive/c/ffmpeg-0.10.3

11 - Type the following and press enter: 

> ./build_android.sh

12 - Sit back and wait... libffmpeg.so will soon appear in your ""c:\ffmpeg-0.10.3\android\<ARCHITECTURE>"" directory (where <ARCHITECTURE> is defined in the bottom of the script from roman10's blog). The default architecture is armv7-a.

The script from roman10's blog will actually compile quite a large shared object (.so) file. The compiler flags can be adjusted to suit your needs in the script from roman10's blog.

I hope this helps,

I'll state the question and follow with the problem and my first attempt at a solution for background.

**Question**  
***How can I set a binary state flag (true/false,1/0,on/off) in windows, for a Perl script, or any language, to reference? A common binary state flag that is easily 'checkable' by other processes.***

I have tried ***Environment Variables***, but the Process Environment Block version of the variables will not reflect updates made to the System Environment Variables, and I need to detect a change during the life of a particular process.

I considered checking a ***Flag File*** (whether it exists as opposed to its contents) and this seems a little hokey, though straight-forward. It also involves some I/O though it will be checked so frequently I assume that it's existence will be maintained in memory and require little actual disk read time.

I also considered a ***Registry Key***. This seems like a somewhat reasonable solution since the registry is a single authoritative source of reference, as opposed to the environment variables which may have different states per process.  But is this an acceptable method?

I consider a ***Windows Service*** with a simple getter and setter for a flag, that would either run on each agent box or on a single box that would be referenced over the network. Even in this case I question if it is best to maintain flag as a member variable/env variable/registry entry? This seems to be much more complex and would require much more support/moving parts. There are obvious pros and cons to hosting on each agent box and hosting on single box which I am not concerned with.

**Problem Explanation**  
My company utilizes Informatica for ETL development and processing to and from our IMA hub architecture. We utilize CA Cybermation Enterprise Scheduling Product (""ESP"") to schedule these ETLs. 

ETLs are kicked off by a perl script that sits on each ESP agent box. This script calls an informatica executable and takes in parameters that detail which workflow in which repository with which credentials (etc.) to execute. *If LDAPSync is running in the repository at the time the request is submitted, the workflow(s) will fail.* This is because no IDs can be authenticated. Previously, Informatica provided a built in mechanism that would detect whether this process was running and hold all submitted jobs until the sync was complete, so they would not fail and need to be restarted. (at any given time this could be 1-1000 jobs)

Informatica won't build this functionality into the current tool set and they advise we sync when ETLs aren't running (at a certain time of night)... that would be never given the size and number of jobs at my company, so this is not an option. (part of the problem is that we have NRT (Near Real-Time) jobs that run very frequently for replication/propogation purposes) 

A solution would allow us to run the LDAP Sync several times a day without any interruptions, as opposed to once monthly during outages or on demand, which requires unscheduled outages.

**Workaround**  
I added some code to the Perl script, that kicks off the ETLs, that checks an Environment Variable which reflects whether LDAPSync is running. If it is running then it waits until the flag indicates completion before submitting jobs to the Informatica Service.

This didn't work since the environment variables are copied when the script is kicked off so it cannot detect when the System ENV variables are changed. (since it references its process's local copy)

Which brings me back to the question.  How can I set and read a binary state flag in windows to communicate a state to several processes? It doesn't matter if this flag will need to be updated individually on each agent machines since this can be handled trivially with our scheduling tool.

Please let me know if you have any questions or ***tag suggestions***, and I am very grateful for your guidance.

The application uses Swedish as its default language, with an English localization DLL in the form AppNameENU.dll, so MFC is actually *intentionally* switching to English language under these circumstances, as if it's not caring for the user choice in the MUI-enabled Windows OS, and only the default shipping language of the Windows install?

1)  Run Image Prep Utility (I wrote) on windows to add my runonce entries and clean a few things up.  
2)  Reboot to ghost, make image file.  
3)  Package into my ISO and distribute.  
4)  System will be imaged by user.  
5)  On first boot, I have about 5 things that run, one of which includes a driver updater (I wrote) for my own specific devices.  
6)  One of the entries inside of HKCU/../runonce is a reg file, which adds another key to HKLM/../runonce.  This is how second boot is acquired.  
7)  As a result of the driver updater, user is prompted to reboot.  
8)  My application is then launched from HKLM/../runonce on second boot.  

This workflow works perfectly, except for a select few legacy systems that contain devices that cause the add hardware wizard to pop up.  When the add hardware wizard pops up is when I begin to see problems. It's important to note, that if I manually inspect the registry after the add hardware wizard pops up, it appears as I would expect, with all the first boot scripts having run, and it's sitting in a state I would correctly expect it to be in for a second boot scenario.

The problem comes when I click next on the add hardware wizard, it seems to re-run the single entry I've added, and re-executes the runonce scripts.  (only one script now as it's already executed and cleared out the initial entries).  This causes my application to open as if it were a second boot, only when next is clicked on the add hardware wizard.  If I click cancel, and reboot, then it also works as expected.

I don't care as much about other solutions, because I could design a system that doesn't fully rely on Microsoft's registry.  I simply can't find any information as to WHY this is happening.  I believe this is some type of Microsoft issue that's presenting itself as a result of an overstretched image that's expected to support too many legacy platforms, but any help that can be provided would be appreciated.

There are tools out there that give you a GUI for setting this easily, but you can also do it relatively easily by editing the registry.

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon

Add the following values:

Important: Using auto-logon is insecure and should, in general, never be used for standard computer configurations. The problem is not only that your computer is accessible to anyone with physical access to it, but also that the password is saved in plain-text in a well known location in your registry. This is usually used for test environments or for special setups. This is even more important to notice if you intend to perform auto-logon as an administrator.

We have two servers, server A has our live websites, and server B has the same websites, but for development. Therefore, everything we do, we develop and test on server B before putting out to server A. Both servers are running ISS 6.0 and Windows Server 2003.

So I made the necessary changes to my ASP.Net website on the web.config file:

    <authentication mode=""Windows""/>

In ISS, we turned Integrated Windows Authentication on, and turned off annonymous access.

Easily enough, it worked great on server B.

I handled user information using the User.Identity structure on my program.

Apparently we had it solved, until we tried the same thing on server A.

Unexpectedly, although all the settings seem the same, we can't make it work.

So here are the symptoms and some more information for server A:

Situations:

 1 - When Annonymous Access is on, the website comes up

 2 - When IWA is on and Annonymous Access is off, the website DOES NOT come up

 3 - When IWA and Digest are on, Annonymous Access is off, the website DOES NOT come up

 - The website is a Virtual Directory
 - The identity for the AppPool is Network Service
 - We gave users proper access to the folder where files are located
 - The server is in the same domain as users are
 - When trying to run the website on firefox (situation 2 and 3) we get challenged for every single request to the server (images, css, anything), so multiple challenges there
 - When trying to run the website on IE, nothing (situation 2 and 3) comes up
 - Server A and B are patched to the same level

",windows,iis,authentication,integrated,iwa,,open,0,306,7,"Integrated Windows Authentication, where else to look? I have been trying to have Integrated Windows Authentication for a website that is mostly ran in our local network (which is entirely AD based). We have two servers, server A has our live websites, and server B has the same websites, but for development. Therefore, everything we do, we develop and test on server B before putting out to server A. Both servers are running ISS 6.0 and Windows Server 2003.

So I made the necessary changes to my ASP.Net website on the web.config file:

    <authentication mode=""Windows""/>

In ISS, we turned Integrated Windows Authentication on, and turned off annonymous access.

Easily enough, it worked great on server B.

I handled user information using the User.Identity structure on my program.

Apparently we had it solved, until we tried the same thing on server A.

Unexpectedly, although all the settings seem the same, we can't make it work.

So here are the symptoms and some more information for server A:

Situations:

 1 - When Annonymous Access is on, the website comes up

 2 - When IWA is on and Annonymous Access is off, the website DOES NOT come up

 3 - When IWA and Digest are on, Annonymous Access is off, the website DOES NOT come up

 - The website is a Virtual Directory
 - The identity for the AppPool is Network Service
 - We gave users proper access to the folder where files are located
 - The server is in the same domain as users are
 - When trying to run the website on firefox (situation 2 and 3) we get challenged for every single request to the server (images, css, anything), so multiple challenges there
 - When trying to run the website on IE, nothing (situation 2 and 3) comes up
 - Server A and B are patched to the same level

I don't know where else to look. Any ideas??

- adding new employees to Active Directory
- Deleting employees who are terminated
- Solving server backups
- Ensuring anti-virus is working

HOWEVER, we don't want to give the offshore administrator 'god' access to our network, because we're scared that he could do some serious damage.

Because the script deployed our web application to the development servers, we wanted to prevent multiple team members from running the daily build at the same time (and overwriting each others' deployment).

So, the first step of the script was to use the output append operator to write the user's username to a known file on a public share.

The advantages of using the registry, it seems to me, are fairly simple:

 1. Allow flags (file paths, etc) to be stored between runs of a program.
 2. You can back up the entire registry in one fell swoop.
 3. Follow standard practices of installation (a minor benefit, but when all else is equal, it's a good idea to follow standards).

That *seems* to be it (I may be missing something).

Additionally, it seems like a developer has more control over a hidden directory, being able to store multiple types of data in custom files. Plus, there's the advantage of storing everything associated with a program within a single, easily deleted/backed-up folder.

Possibly along the lines of [Multipoint][1]


as an alternative, is there any software which can render more that one cursor. Like CPNMouse [I couldn't post another link, sorry]  cpnmouse(dot)sourceforge(dot)net ?

""Depends"" lists these as red where it describes the architecture, since I am making an AMD64 binary. A few of the DLLs (QT dlls I compiled from source) are listed as AMD64.

Under my project -> properties -> linker -> advanced -> Target Machine, I have tried both ""MachineX64"" and ""Not Set"". Both of these settings result in the same error message at run time when I attempt to run my executable. 

I am not very knowledgeable about building software in the windows environment. Most of my experience comes from Linux. To me, this seems like a DLL architecture issue, but I am not certain.

People have [suggested various third-party software][1] (AKA not the built-in windows photo viewer) to solve this shortcoming. But since the photo viewer uses WIC ([Windows Imaging Component][2]) to decode images, this system can be used to add support for just about any format. I'm guessing this means I could make a replacement GIF codec to replace the built-in one, but before I do I need to know something.

So, what I'm asking is, is the reason the photo viewer doesn't support animated gifs is because of the fact that WIC only supports still images? Or is it that WPV doesn't have supported coded in for animated formats but WIC codecs can support them? If it's either of these reasons, I guess I have no reason to start this project.

...or did Microsoft seriously not get around to adding the support themselves?

Not that I have any problem with Poland, I just don't know why my laptop has the need to communicate with a server there.  Reverse DNS shows just the ISP providing the address to some end user.  Using Wireshark, I can monitor the messages, which were indecipherable as they were probably encrypted.  All packets sent from my machine had the same source port, so clearly the application that sent them opened this UDP socket to use it.  I am searching for ways to:

1) enumerate all current sockets open in the system, including the process that created it and, for both TCP and UDP, what ports and addresses they are current bound to.  

2) because applications can open these sockets, use them, and close them right away,  I would love to find (or perhaps even write) a program that once started would somehow get notification each time a socket gets created, or really more importantly when bound to a source and/or destination address and port.  For UDP, I would love to also be able to monitor/keep track of the destination IP addresses and ports that socket has sent messages to.

I discovered almost accidentally that my machine was sending and receiving UDP packets to a machine in Poland.  Not that I have any problem with Poland, I just don't know why my laptop has the need to communicate with a server there.  Reverse DNS shows just the ISP providing the address to some end user.  Using Wireshark, I can monitor the messages, which were indecipherable as they were probably encrypted.  All packets sent from my machine had the same source port, so clearly the application that sent them opened this UDP socket to use it.  I am searching for ways to:

1) enumerate all current sockets open in the system, including the process that created it and, for both TCP and UDP, what ports and addresses they are current bound to.  

2) because applications can open these sockets, use them, and close them right away,  I would love to find (or perhaps even write) a program that once started would somehow get notification each time a socket gets created, or really more importantly when bound to a source and/or destination address and port.  For UDP, I would love to also be able to monitor/keep track of the destination IP addresses and ports that socket has sent messages to.

The call is from the example function [SetupEnumAvailableComPorts][2]. It looks like this:

I get the error ""Types of actual and formal parameters must be identical"" on the parameters @PropertyRegDataType, and @RequiredSize. These parameters are declared:

      var
      RequiredSize:             Cardinal;
      PropertyRegDataType:      DWord;

 MSDN describes these parameters as: *""RequiredSize [out, optional] A pointer to a variable of type DWORD that receives the required size, in bytes, of the PropertyBuffer buffer that is required to hold the data for the requested property. This parameter is optional and can be NULL.*"" and *""PropertyRegDataType [out, optional] A pointer to a variable that receives the data type of the property that is being retrieved. This is one of the standard registry data types. This parameter is optional and can be NULL.""*

      var PropertyRegDataType: DWORD; PropertyBuffer: PBYTE; PropertyBufferSize: DWORD;
      var RequiredSize: DWORD): BOOL; stdcall;
      {$EXTERNALSYM SetupDiGetDeviceRegistryProperty}

Since PropertyRegDataType and RequiredSize are var parameters, they should be able to be passed without the @ operator. In fact, if I remove the @ operators from the function call parameters, the code compiles, but crashes with an access violation (read of address 0). The [original code][4] was written for Delphi 7, so why would they use the @ operator on these parameters? What am I missing?

 - [other vendor] sends files to my windows filesystem, which are indexed starting we the next unused number (normaly file.001)
 - i move the files with robocopy to my unix fileysystem and process them. After processing i remove the file. So these files are just for transportation of the data.

The problem is: while slowly processing the file, the [other vendor] may send new files (starting again with file.001), and robocopy is replacing the files on my unix system with the newer files (which is the behaviour, robocopy was intended for). Is there any way to suppress this behaviour? (something like ""leave the file.001 on the windows filesystem and try again in a minute"" )
