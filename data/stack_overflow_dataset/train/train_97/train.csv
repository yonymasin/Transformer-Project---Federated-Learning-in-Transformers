 - Supports running tests within the IDE
 - Supports debugging within the IDE while running either the tests or the app itself

Here's a rundown of my experience so far

**Eclipse**
Using the latest plugins available from the update site, Eclipse's support for Groovy/Grails is truly pathetic. It provides little more than code completion and spurious errors

**NetBeans**
As soon as I imported the project, NetBeans began scanning it. The Navigator view was waiting for the scanning to finish before showing it's contents. About 20 minutes later, both the Navigator view and I were still waiting. 

**IntelliJ**
Although the general concensus is that IntelliJ is the best IDE for Groovy/Grails, [it does not work well with Grails 1.1.X][1]. The root cause of the problem appears to be the change in the location of the plugins folder. In my case, this prevented me from running the tests from within the IDE.

So my question (finally) is whether anyone has found an IDE (not TextMate or Vim) that works with Grails 1.1.X when the plugin folder is in it's default location, i.e. under $HOME/.grails/1.1.X/plugins?

If so, I'd be really grateful for information about:

 - Which IDE to use (including version number)
 - Which plugins (if any) need to be installed
 - How to import an existing project into the IDE
 - How to run the app, the tests, and debug from within the IDE (if it's not obvious)

If you go to /appname/mycontroller/action it should check your session and if there is no session pick language based on browser preference and redirect to the language prefixed site. If you have session then it will display english. English does not have en prefix (to make it harder).

Its not fully working and langs are hardcoded just for now. I think i did something wrong. Some of the reverse mappings work but some dont add language.

If i use link tag and pass params:[lang:'pl'] then it works but if i add params:[lang:'pl', page:2] then it does not. In the second case both lang and page number become parameters in the query string. What is worse they dont affect the locale so page shows in english.

Can anyone please point me to the documentation what are the rules of reverse mappings or even better how to implement such language prefix in a good way ?

    	}
    }

Its not fully working and langs are hardcoded just for now. I think i did something wrong. Some of the reverse mappings work but some dont add language.

If i use link tag and pass params:[lang:'pl'] then it works but if i add params:[lang:'pl', page:2] then it does not. In the second case both lang and page number become parameters in the query string. What is worse they dont affect the locale so page shows in english.

Can anyone please point me to the documentation what are the rules of reverse mappings or even better how to implement such language prefix in a good way ?

THANKS

I thought String would not have a maximum size but when people put in messages that are too big then I see exceptions in my log files.  For now I put a constraint in to limit the size of the message to 250 but cannot make it bigger or else the save fails.  I am using PostgreSQL 9.1.1 and Grails 1.3.7.  Does anyone know a way to fix this?",1

**Here's the issue:** when our JBoss server deploys our grails war file, something appears to cause log4j to be reconfigured such that the appserver stops all logging from that  point forward (for any class). The app server is still running fine, but there is no logging after this line:

    INFO  [org.jboss.web.tomcat.service.deployers.TomcatDeployment] (main) deploy, ctxPath=/our-app

Removing our war file and restarting the server shows things logging correctly.

Our appserver has a `server/default/conf/jboss-log4j.xml` file in  where we specify our cross-app log4j config.

I've tried removing log4j and slf4j jar files from our war, as that has caused issues in the past, but it hasn't solved the problem this time.

I also commented out the entire `log4j` section of `grails-app/Config.groovy` thinking that might be the culprit, but that had no effect.

I also tried removing the grails log4j plugin (by marking it as 'provided' scope in the pom), but that causes the following error during deployment:

    ERROR [org.apache.catalina.core.ContainerBase.[jboss.web].[localhost].[/out-app]] (main) Error configuring application listener of class org.codehaus.groovy.grails.plugins.log4j.web.util.Log4jConfigListener

",grails,jboss,log4j,,,,open,0,1058,7,"Grails 2.1 disables log4j config on JBoss We recently upgraded our app from Grails 1.3.7 to 2.1, which builds under maven, and made a bunch of changes to the pom file and other config- and build-related files of grails to get things working.

**Here's the issue:** when our JBoss server deploys our grails war file, something appears to cause log4j to be reconfigured such that the appserver stops all logging from that  point forward (for any class). The app server is still running fine, but there is no logging after this line:

    INFO  [org.jboss.web.tomcat.service.deployers.TomcatDeployment] (main) deploy, ctxPath=/our-app

Removing our war file and restarting the server shows things logging correctly.

Our appserver has a `server/default/conf/jboss-log4j.xml` file in  where we specify our cross-app log4j config.

I've tried removing log4j and slf4j jar files from our war, as that has caused issues in the past, but it hasn't solved the problem this time.

I also commented out the entire `log4j` section of `grails-app/Config.groovy` thinking that might be the culprit, but that had no effect.

I also tried removing the grails log4j plugin (by marking it as 'provided' scope in the pom), but that causes the following error during deployment:

    ERROR [org.apache.catalina.core.ContainerBase.[jboss.web].[localhost].[/out-app]] (main) Error configuring application listener of class org.codehaus.groovy.grails.plugins.log4j.web.util.Log4jConfigListener
        java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.codehaus.groovy.grails.plugins.log4j.web.util.Log4jConfigListener

        }
    }

The above code works fine and is only a little verbose-looking with the switch statements.  But what if I want to add functionality to choose to match ANY of the rules or ALL of them?  I would need to conditionally put the rules in an `or{}`.  I can't do something like
 
    if(groupOp == 'or'){
        or{
    }

before I go through the rulesList and then

    if(groupOp == 'or'){
        }
    }

afterward.  All I can think to do is to repeat the code for each condition:

    if(groupOp == 'or'){
        or{
            rulesList.each { rule ->
                switch(rule['op']){
                    ...
                }
            }
        }
    }
    else{
        rulesList.each { rule ->
            switch(rule['op']){
                ...
            }
        }

Now the code is looking quite sloppy and repetitive.  Suppose I want to search on a property of a property of the domain object? (Ex: I want to return vehicles whose tires are a certain brand; vehicle.tires.brand, or vehicles whose drivers match a name; vehicle.driver.name).  Would I have to do something like:

    switch(rule['op']){
        case 'eq':
            switch(thePropertiesProperty){
                case Garage:
                    garage{
                        eq(""${rule['field']}"", rule['value'])

                    break

                    driver{

                }
            }
        }
    }

The above code works fine and is only a little verbose-looking with the switch statements.  But what if I want to add functionality to choose to match ANY of the rules or ALL of them?  I would need to conditionally put the rules in an `or{}`.  I can't do something like
 
    if(groupOp == 'or'){
        or{
    }

before I go through the rulesList and then

    if(groupOp == 'or'){
        }
    }

afterward.  All I can think to do is to repeat the code for each condition:

    if(groupOp == 'or'){
        or{
            rulesList.each { rule ->
                switch(rule['op']){
                    ...
                }
            }
        }
    }
    else{
        rulesList.each { rule ->
            switch(rule['op']){
                ...
            }
        }

Now the code is looking quite sloppy and repetitive.  Suppose I want to search on a property of a property of the domain object? (Ex: I want to return vehicles whose tires are a certain brand; vehicle.tires.brand, or vehicles whose drivers match a name; vehicle.driver.name).  Would I have to do something like:

    switch(rule['op']){
        case 'eq':
            switch(thePropertiesProperty){
                case Garage:
                    garage{
                        eq(""${rule['field']}"", rule['value'])
                    }
                    break
                case Driver:
                    driver{
                         eq(""${rule['field']}"", rule['value'])
                    }
                    break

Finally, which of those frameworks do you think will be more used in the future? 
I have the feeling that Grails is far from reaching a critical mass and it still remains very obscure (in the past few months I had the opportunity to work with middle size and IT startups working mostly with the JVM stack and only one person knew and used Grails) and I am not even sure if it can become the ""RoR"" of the Java world (Indeed reports a drop of growth in the last few months even if other frameworks have a positive growing rate). And I love Groovy, it is really easy to learn but I have noticed how slow it can be for some tasks.
 
On the other hand, Scala seems to be more popular (Tiobe Index) and the fact that Twitter is using it know gave it even more presence in the blogosphere with lots of lovers and haters making buzz. It is famous for being fast and scalable. However, the language seems somewhat hard to understand and learn for lots of developers (so maybe it will never gain mainstream status) and Lift is little known and I have read some reports that it is better suited for small apps (less than 20 domain classes).

By seeing the number of books published Groovy-Grails dominate right now, but many publishers have Scala book on the works, so I think this advantage will not last long.

Finally, we have the problem that both languages and frameworks still have poor IDE support (it is getting better by the day but far away from what Java shops expect to be productive).

I have the feeling that Grails is far from reaching a critical mass and it still remains very obscure (in the past few months I had the opportunity to work with middle size and IT startups working mostly with the JVM stack and only one person knew and used Grails) and I am not even sure if it can become the ""RoR"" of the Java world (Indeed reports a drop of growth in the last few months even if other frameworks have a positive growing rate). And I love Groovy, it is really easy to learn but I have noticed how slow it can be for some tasks.
 
On the other hand, Scala seems to be more popular (Tiobe Index) and the fact that Twitter is using it know gave it even more presence in the blogosphere with lots of lovers and haters making buzz. It is famous for being fast and scalable. However, the language seems somewhat hard to understand and learn for lots of developers (so maybe it will never gain mainstream status) and Lift is little known and I have read some reports that it is better suited for small apps (less than 20 domain classes).

By seeing the number of books published Groovy-Grails dominate right now, but many publishers have Scala book on the works, so I think this advantage will not last long.

Finally, we have the problem that both languages and frameworks still have poor IDE support (it is getting better by the day but far away from what Java shops expect to be productive). 

I do not want to start a flame wars, but I would be very interested to hear other users' opinions.",2

I have added a 'def springSecurityService' into the listener which I was hoping would automatically inject the service but this doesn't appear to be the case.
