    String foo = ""foo""
    foo.noSuchMethod()
or

I assumed that the first example would generate a compile-time error, whereas the second would only fail at runtime. However, this doesn't appear to be the case. In my experience, a compile-time error is generated in neither case.

Am I right in assuming then that the only benefit of declaring the type of a reference is as a form of documentation, i.e. to communicate intentions to other programmers. For example, if I write a method such as:

    def capitalize(String arg) {
        return arg.toUpperCase()
    }

This communicates the type of arguments that should be passed to the function much more effectively than:

    def capitalize(def arg) {
        return arg.toUpperCase()
    }

Does the Groovy compiler perform any type-checking when types are specified?

The concept is simple: For a boattrip you need some rowers, a coxwain (is also a rower) and a boat:

In Grails when you create an app you get the Production, Development etc environments by default.

If you want to build a WAR for Production you can run either of these commands:

    grails war
OR

    grails -Dgrails.env=prod war

If you want to create a WAR for the development environment you use the command:

    grails -Dgrails.env=dev war

My questions;

1) Can I use the word 'production' instead of 'prod' and use 'development' instead of 'dev'? I assume that 'prod' and 'dev' are just shorthand for 'production' and 'development', so I should be able to use either?

2) If so, if I introduce my own environment called 'Stage' can I create a shorthand for use in setting -Dgrails.env? Something like 'stg' for example.
