To start with I have kept the requirements

- I am looking for a nice/easy/fast/simple python based web-application-stack. 
- The purpose is to learn and build a commercial scalable application.
- Which teaches me un-ambigous best-practiced development, majorly web-development.
- My development-environment-of-choice ubuntu (altough i would like the project to cross-platform).
- My choice of development language python.
- To start with I would like to develop a delicious-social-tagging kind of application.
- It will be great, after i develop my application, give it to my friend as a zip. He unzips and just run it. Something like xampp setup.  

As of now i am finding web2py better than all. But can i use tornado web server with it. Is it possible to run tornado as only event-based web-server, and not use its FrameWork part?

 
What have I looked at ?  
- Django: Its like start menu for python-based-web-development. Does everybody starts from here?

To start with I have kept the requirements

- I am looking for a nice/easy/fast/simple python based web-application-stack. 
- The purpose is to learn and build a commercial scalable application.
- Which teaches me un-ambigous best-practiced development, majorly web-development.
- My development-environment-of-choice ubuntu (altough i would like the project to cross-platform).
- My choice of development language python.
- To start with I would like to develop a delicious-social-tagging kind of application.
- It will be great, after i develop my application, give it to my friend as a zip. He unzips and just run it. Something like xampp setup.  

As of now i am finding web2py better than all. But can i use tornado web server with it. Is it possible to run tornado as only event-based web-server, and not use its FrameWork part?

 
What have I looked at ?  
- Django: Its like start menu for python-based-web-development. Does everybody starts from here?

The name key is also unreliable because it depends on the language in use, so if the language is Italian the name key won't be ""interface"" but ""interfaccia"".

I suspect this problem is due to the fact that put_atributes signals the data base for writing, but does not wait until this change has been made persistent.

I'm more interested in how to iterate the structure such that I can put the children in the right parents, rather than the exact output as XML. Any advise about maybe altering the structure of the data would also be appreciated, as I feel like I have painted myself into a corner!

I wanted to reproduce this a trailing stars image from a timelapse set of pictures. Inspired by this:
Inspiration image (I can't ""upload"" images because I'm a new user click links to imgur to see these if you want to): http:/i.stack.imgur.com/tZ7zW.jpg


[The original author][1] used low resolution video frames taken with VirtualDub and combined with imageJ. I imagined I could easily reproduce this process but with a more memory-conscious approach with Python, so I could use [the original high-resolution images][2] for a better output.

My algorithm's idea is simple, merging two images at a time, and then iterating by merging the resulting image with the next image. This done some hundreds of times and properly weighing it so that every image has the same contribution to the final result.

I'm fairly new to python (and I'm no professional programmer, that'll be evident), but looking around it appears to me the Python Imaging Library is very standard, so I decided to use it (correct me if you think something else would be better).

Here's what I have so far:

    #program to blend many images into one
    import os,Image
    files = os.listdir(""./"")
    finalimage=Image.open(""./""+files[0]) #add the first image
    for i in range(1,len(files)): #note that this will skip files[0] but go all the way to the last file
      currentimage=Image.open(""./""+files[i])
      finalimage=Image.blend(finalimage,currentimage,1/float(i+1))#alpha is 1/i+1 so when the image is a combination of i images any adition only contributes 1/i+1.
      print ""\r"" + str(i+1) + ""/"" + str(len(files)) #lousy progress indicator
    finalimage.save(""allblended.jpg"",""JPEG"")

This does what it's supposed to but the resulting image is dark, and if I simply try to enhance it, it's evident that information was lost due lack of depth in pixel's values. (I'm not sure what the proper term here is, color depth, color precision, pixel size). 
Here's the final result using low resolution images:

http:/i.stack.imgur.com/ixppn.jpg


or one I was trying with the full 4k by 2k resolution (from another set of photos):

http:/i.stack.imgur.com/JbNWL.jpg

So, I tried to fix it by setting the image mode:

    firstimage=Image.open(""./""+files[0])
    size = firstimage.size
    finalimage=Image.new(""I"",size)

but apparently Image.blend does not accept that image mode.
> ValueError: image has wrong mode

Any ideas?

(I also tried making the images ""less dark"" by multiplying it before combining them with im.point(lambda i: i * 2) but results were just as bad)

I have been looking up tutorials but all I can find is how to make it look like it is snowing, lol.  I have been trying to implement that method into moving an object but I am having no luck.  All I want to do is move an object across the screen and when it reaches the end of the screen it resets and goes again.  So I am trying to move the object that I put in my code (the two polygons, line, and circle) across the screen, horizonally or vertically, doesnt really matter.

Where should I start to find a solution, since I have no messages/exceptions/crashes, it simply ends immediately after i run it from command line.

I predict that if I'd install some of tools from ""build system"" I would run it.
Is this the only way?

I have listed in the ""Notes"" section what i plan to implement.

The main thing that i want to do, is include the ability to exclude specific directories and files, i have highlighted where i think it should be implemented, but please give feedback if any better ideas are found.

I know that artificial benchmarks are evil. They can show results only for very specific narrow situation. I don't assume that one language is better than the other because of the some stupid bench. However I wonder why results is so different. Please see my questions at the bottom.

##Math benchmark description

Benchmark is simple math calculations to find pairs of prime numbers which differs by 6 (so called [sexy primes][1])
E.g. sexy primes below 100 would be: `(5 11) (7 13) (11 17) (13 19) (17 23) (23 29) (31 37) (37 43) (41 47) (47 53) (53 59) (61 67) (67 73) (73 79) (83 89) (97 103)`

##Questions

1. Why Scala is so fast? Is it because of **static typing**? Or it is just using JVM very efficiently?
2. Why such a huge difference between Ruby and Python? I thought these two are not somewhat totally different. Maybe my code is wrong. Please enlighten me! Thanks.
3. Really impressive jump in productivity between Ruby versions.
4. Can I optimize clojure by adding type declarations? Will it help?

I know that artificial benchmarks are evil. They can show results only for very specific narrow situation. I don't assume that one language is better than the other because of the some stupid bench. However I wonder why results is so different. Please see my questions at the bottom.

##Math benchmark description

Benchmark is simple math calculations to find pairs of prime numbers which differs by 6 (so called [sexy primes][1])
E.g. sexy primes below 100 would be: `(5 11) (7 13) (11 17) (13 19) (17 23) (23 29) (31 37) (37 43) (41 47) (47 53) (53 59) (61 67) (67 73) (73 79) (83 89) (97 103)`

the real questions for the job are big-o performance and making it better but i can do that i just need to understand this code

**question A**: in is_bar they compare the iterator to the array (if i == b).  is this the equivalent of (if i == b.length)?

**question B**: 
so following the flow of the function and assuming the above and (a = [1,2,3] b=[3,4,5]) is true the first comparison is comparing two iterators???? 

so it would be: 

 1. is_bar(b, 0) 
 2. for i in b   (says a but its b from above)  
 3. if 0 == 0 
 4. so it evaluates to true and does c.append(0)    
 5. does this 3 more times and since its comparing iterators it would append 1,2 than unique (c)
 6.which makes a new array the same size as c and makes every values = 1

but that wouldnt make sense.  Appearently there is somthing im missing because a function that takes 2 arrays, then creates an array of equal size of the second array and makes all values = 1 would be stupid.

**question C**: what does b.keys() return exactly  (i looked up the function but it says ""list of all the keys used"" but that doesnt make sense since it is a one-dimension array)

    import time,sys
    
    count = 10 * 1000 * 1000
    t1 = time.time()
    
    d = dict()

    t2 = time.time()
    
    print(""time=%f"" % (t2-t1))
    print(""size of dictionary: %d"" % sys.getsizeof(d))

So I ran this in Python2.7 on my mac and got:


    $ python2.7 pyspeed.py
    time= 7.24679493904
    size of dictionary: 402653464

    time= 7.26046490669
    size of dictionary: 402653464

Now when I tried to run it in Python3.1 it didn't work, of course, because `xrange` has been depreciated. All the documentation I've read says that range now works as xrange did. So here's the rewritten program:

    import time,sys
    
    count = 10 * 1000 * 1000
    t1 = time.time()
    
    d = dict()

        d[i] = i
    for i in range(0,count):

    for i in range(0,count):
        d[i] = d[i]-i
    t2 = time.time()
    
    print(""time=%f"" % (t2-t1))
    print(""size of dictionary: %d"" % sys.getsizeof(d))

And the Python3.1 performance:

    $ python3.1 pyspeed.py
    time=7.869891

    $ python3.1 pyspeed.py

    $ python3.1 pyspeed.py
    time=7.879416
    size of dictionary: 402653464

Which is slower by 7%.

Just for a hunch, I tried running the program with `range` instead of `xrange` under Python2.7 and got nearly identical results:

    $ python2.7 pyspeed.py
    time=7.735200

Which is *still* better than Python3.1, but not quite as good as 2.7 with xrange.

It looks to me like:

 1. Python3.1 is still significantly
    slower than Python2.  Why is it not
    faster? 
 2. Despite what the documentation claims, `range()` in

Below is how I am currently doing this but I am convinced there must be an easier way.

First I create a definition that will search the files and extract the data. I use a definition since sometimes the data will be compiled from several locations. I am doing this via a mixture of regular expressions and find all. This can be formatted differently if needed. The result of this is something like:

    RawData=
    [[M1,A1,305.91,288.12,Variable_M1_A1],
    [M1,A2,319.07,303.70,Variable_M1_A2],
    [M2,A1,237437.32,191460.91,Variable_M2_A1],
    [M2,A2,270773.28,192581.05,Variable_M2_A2]]

What I wish to do with some of the data is organize it in such a way that a grid is created from the variables A and M and then the data from a column is placed in the correct grid location. Realistically looks like a simple two dimension matrix with the first row and first column indicating the variables.

What the csv file should look like:

    Placeholder,A1,A2
    M1,Variable_M1_A1,Variable_M1_A2
    M2,Variable_M2_A1,Variable_M2_A2

What I currently am doing is creating an empty matrix (3x3 in this case) calling it Result then running the following code. The basically iterates over all lines and all variables when the variables match, it assigns the Result matrix a value from the RawData.

    MVar=[M1,M2]
    AVar=[A1,A2]
    for a in range(len(RawData):
        for b in range(len(MVar)):
            for c in range(len(AVar)):
                if RawData[a][0]==Mvar[b] and RawData[a][1]==AVar[c]:
                    Result[b+1][c+1]=RawData[a][4]

I wrote a chunk of code that will take the RawData matrix and create the Result matrix based off all possible combinations of M1 and A1. If I want to outport this to .csv I simply use csv.writer. So this works great if I just want to organize the data that is already there. However when I want to do calculations with the data- such as generating another column that is based off values in the RawData that did not end up in the matrix- it becomes difficult. For example to take what the csv file output could look like:

    Placeholder,A1,A2,NewA
    M1,Variable_M1_A1,Variable_M1_A2,(RawData[0][3]*RawData[1][2]) 
    M2,Variable_M2_A1,Variable_M2_A2,(RawData[2][3]*RawData[3][2])

Notice that the data for the calculations require the same M value but different A values. While this can be done it quickly becomes very convoluted. 

Is there a simpler way to do this? ",python,optimization,csv,matrix,,,open,0,475,8,"Efficiently organizing data into a readable .csv format I am trying to figure out a better way to extract data from a large number of files, run additional calculations on some data, and finally format it into a something readable by a spreadsheet application. Below is how I am currently doing this but I am convinced there must be an easier way.

First I create a definition that will search the files and extract the data. I use a definition since sometimes the data will be compiled from several locations. I am doing this via a mixture of regular expressions and find all. This can be formatted differently if needed. The result of this is something like:

    RawData=
    [[M1,A1,305.91,288.12,Variable_M1_A1],
    [M1,A2,319.07,303.70,Variable_M1_A2],
    [M2,A1,237437.32,191460.91,Variable_M2_A1],
    [M2,A2,270773.28,192581.05,Variable_M2_A2]]

What I wish to do with some of the data is organize it in such a way that a grid is created from the variables A and M and then the data from a column is placed in the correct grid location. Realistically looks like a simple two dimension matrix with the first row and first column indicating the variables.

What the csv file should look like:

    Placeholder,A1,A2
    M1,Variable_M1_A1,Variable_M1_A2
    M2,Variable_M2_A1,Variable_M2_A2

What I currently am doing is creating an empty matrix (3x3 in this case) calling it Result then running the following code. The basically iterates over all lines and all variables when the variables match, it assigns the Result matrix a value from the RawData.

    MVar=[M1,M2]
    AVar=[A1,A2]
    for a in range(len(RawData):
        for b in range(len(MVar)):
            for c in range(len(AVar)):
                if RawData[a][0]==Mvar[b] and RawData[a][1]==AVar[c]:
                    Result[b+1][c+1]=RawData[a][4]

I wrote a chunk of code that will take the RawData matrix and create the Result matrix based off all possible combinations of M1 and A1. If I want to outport this to .csv I simply use csv.writer. So this works great if I just want to organize the data that is already there. However when I want to do calculations with the data- such as generating another column that is based off values in the RawData that did not end up in the matrix- it becomes difficult. For example to take what the csv file output could look like:

    Placeholder,A1,A2,NewA
    M1,Variable_M1_A1,Variable_M1_A2,(RawData[0][3]*RawData[1][2]) 
    M2,Variable_M2_A1,Variable_M2_A2,(RawData[2][3]*RawData[3][2])

Notice that the data for the calculations require the same M value but different A values. While this can be done it quickly becomes very convoluted.

I am writing a program and so far I've stuck to the no more than 79 characters in a line rule. However I'm not sure where to break lines in a few situations.

Here are the problem areas:

            self.proc.stdin.write('(SayText ""%s"")\n' % text.replace('\\', '\\\\').replace('""', '\\""'))

For this situation when I break first line after the '(SayText ""%s"")\n', the second line ends up being 80 characters long. Should I then break the second line somewhere in the brackets like this?

I might have a few imports and a class definition or two in each. I'm wondering, is there any reason I should or shouldn't merge these into one module, something like `misc.py`?

My thoughts are that having separate modules helps with code clarity, and later on, if by some chance these modules grow to more than 10 lines, I won't feel so bad about having them separated. But on the other hand, it just seems like such a waste to have a bunch of files with only a few lines in each! And is there any significant difference in resource usage between the multi-file vs. single-file approach? (Of course I'm nowhere near the point where I should be worrying about resource usage, but I couldn't resist asking...)

I might have a few imports and a class definition or two in each. I'm wondering, is there any reason I should or shouldn't merge these into one module, something like `misc.py`?

My thoughts are that having separate modules helps with code clarity, and later on, if by some chance these modules grow to more than 10 lines, I won't feel so bad about having them separated. But on the other hand, it just seems like such a waste to have a bunch of files with only a few lines in each! And is there any significant difference in resource usage between the multi-file vs. single-file approach? (Of course I'm nowhere near the point where I should be worrying about resource usage, but I couldn't resist asking...)

The ticket at http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/4398 seems to indicate that a PBServerFactory subclass is needed in order to support custom credential checkers in pb, but so far I have been completely unable to figure out what to override in order to make it use a different ICredentials implementation. Are there any examples (or even just documentation) of how to get pb to use a different credentials class?",5

Mplot3d expects data to be sorted in a certain fashion, to plot a wireframe.  For example, it likes something like this:

The tricky part is that I have to re-arrange the Z array in the same way I do the X and Y, to ensure that the data corresponding with each point is space is preserved.

Ideally, I'd like something that's robust and specifically designed to sort a set of 2-d arrays that contain arbitrary random position points, but even a more pythonic way of doing what I'm already doing would be appreciated.

Well, i would LOVE to expand my programming skills, but i need a project, because the challenges and exercises with no target don't enthusiast me. And reading about the programming language or how to focus this or that problem with no objective its useless.
So, i've been thinking in a project, nothing came to my mind that is not created yet, or it's to difficult to me, or something.

But i would like to start with a IM client that would run in a Linux terminal, and in a future when im comfortable with the protocols and that stuff, move it to a graphical environment in Linux or Windows OS.

For the terminal I'm thinking in something like Pebrot, simple and basic, but over LAN, so you could chat with people on your same workgroup, like i can ask my mom something in the other room, just basic, and just LAN, not outside my router.

In a future i would like to add to it a google talk client.

In the graphical area i would like to do the LAN client, but with popups and everything.

I have two modules 'mod1' and 'mod2'. They are compiled as two distinct 'ext_modules' in my setup.py, as shown here :

    #!/usr/bin/python2
    
    from setuptools import setup, Extension
    
    mod1 = Extension('mod1',
                     sources = ['mod1.cpp'],
                     libraries = ['boost_python'])
    
    mod2 = Extension('mod2',
                     sources = ['mod2.cpp'],
                     libraries = ['boost_python'])
    
    setup(name='foo',
          version='0.0',
          description='',
          ext_modules=[mod1,mod2],
          install_requires=['distribute'])

But internally, 'mod2.hpp' is including 'mod1.hpp', as the first module is defining stuff that is used by the second module.

Both modules are built as shared libraries - but if I'm not mistaken, mod2 needs to be linked to mod1 in order to work, as it needs stuff defined in mod1. Is it possible to define such a dependency with setuptools/distribute ?

Something like :

    mod2 = Extension('mod2',
                     sources = ['mod2.cpp'],
                     libraries = ['boost_python',mod1])


From my various readings, it looks like it is possible to do something like this with boost's bjam utility - unfortunately, I didn't manage to use it (even to compile the example) on my system.

Things I have tried:

 - adding 'mod1.cpp' to the sources of mod2. It works (kind of: I must import mod1 before mod2 to make it work) but I'm loosing the interest of having modules as shared objects.

Workarouds:

 - importing mod1 as a regular python module in mod2, but that would put an extra layer of python within my C++ code

          description='',
          ext_modules=[mod1,mod2],
          install_requires=['distribute'])

But internally, 'mod2.hpp' is including 'mod1.hpp', as the first module is defining stuff that is used by the second module.

Both modules are built as shared libraries - but if I'm not mistaken, mod2 needs to be linked to mod1 in order to work, as it needs stuff defined in mod1. Is it possible to define such a dependency with setuptools/distribute ?

Something like :

    mod2 = Extension('mod2',
                     sources = ['mod2.cpp'],
                     libraries = ['boost_python',mod1])


From my various readings, it looks like it is possible to do something like this with boost's bjam utility - unfortunately, I didn't manage to use it (even to compile the example) on my system.

Things I have tried:

 - adding 'mod1.cpp' to the sources of mod2. It works (kind of: I must import mod1 before mod2 to make it work) but I'm loosing the interest of having modules as shared objects.

Workarouds:

 - importing mod1 as a regular python module in mod2, but that would put an extra layer of python within my C++ code

    class B(A):
        def b(self):

OK, so far so good. However, if I create another class, something goes wrong, which is shown as the following:

    class C(A):

    >>>C().c()

I want to set the default value of 'num' to self.data, which is '100'. Without 'class', it will be much simpler:

    data = 100
    def d(num = data):
        print num

    >>>d()
    >>>100

I've already googled some articles, but still stuck in this problem...

I'm starting to put together a PC based home lab, for an application which is not relevant here. I've chosen to use Python, partly because we use it at work, partly because it's native on both 'doze and 'nix, and partly because I'm starting to get a glimpse of some of the advantages that OO approaches can bring. The instruments include things like USB thermometers and DVMs, the audio input for a spectrum analyser, webcam and so on. So heterogeneous, configurable, not well-defined at the moment.

I want to write not one GUI, but a whole suite of GUIs, from throat-clearing for each single instrument, to running several together and comparing their outputs. Obviously, I don't want to rewrite from scratch for each setup. 

So far, I've got a simple audio input going, using PyAudio in a thread to make it non-blocking, putting chunks into a queue, with Tkinter waiting on the queue to display the average of each data chunk in a label. So far, so simple. A few years ago, at this point I would have started adding spaghetti.

However, I've read a lot of guidelines about how to use Tkinter - one thread, get all its tasks from one queue, which can be loaded by a multiplicity of sources. I've also read a lot about MVC.

So the question. Should I use MVC for a task of this type, or is it overkill? If I do use it, how do I partition? Should I just expand to more instruments with each asynchronous data source shovelling data and display tasks into a (probably Priority) queue, for the single Tk main thread to ask its appropriate display object to show the data? Is that likely to be a sufficiently extensible model so that I don't have major rewrites as my lab grows? 

Perhaps I can make my question more concrete with the next specific job I have for the audio input analyser. The throat-clearing task for the analyser was to display the average power of each chunk - so I can turn the audio sources up and down and see what's happening on the GUI in real time. The next task is to display the average of the phase difference between the channels over many chunks. Computing the phase difference is a no-brainer, that's part of the model, or data source. However, does the avering task go in the Model, it is after all a property of the world out there, and pass parameters from the user to the model to control the amount of averaging, and view the average like any other number. Or do I put the averaging in the View, and have the view ask the model for the relevant historical data, average and display it, probably using an AverageDisplay, subclassed from my simple data display? Or do I put it in the Controller? One problem I had when reading about MVC, the controller appears to be begging for spaghetti to be dumped on it. So I'm not sure I understand enough yet for MVC concepts to be helpful.

I'm very tempted to use what is basically a of data flow approach, and have a thread which computes the average, waiting on a queue from the audio input, feeding the GUI from its queue. That doesn't seem to fit any of the MVC-type partitions, but it feels reasonably clean and extensible, and can map very closely to a block'and'arrows type processing diagram drawn on the back of an envelope.

I decided to give python a try and noticed a few differences. While perl has ARGV, regex, etc. built in, these must be imported in python. 
I thought this gives python a performance advantage since you're only loading what you really need.

So, I wrote a demo program in each language to test its performance.

**Perl**

    printf ""Result: %.5f\n"", $a;

**Python**

    #!/usr/bin/python
    
    from sys import argv
    
    if argv[-1] != 'test':
       exit(1)
    
    print 'Testing...'
    
    a = 1.0
    for i in range(0, 501):
        a+=a/100
    
    print 'Result: %.5f' %a

**Ruby**

    #!/usr/bin/ruby
    
    if ARGV[0] != ""test""
     exit(1)
    end
    
    print ""Testing...\n""
    a = 1.0
    
    (0..500).each do a+=a/100 end
    
    printf ""Result: %.5f"", a
**C**

    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <string.h>
    
    int main (int argc, char *argv[]) {
    
    if (strcmp(argv[1], ""test"") != 0) return(1);
    
    printf(""Testing...\n"");

Here’s the function I've written to determine how to treat each point:

    def stepinfo(x, y):
        y1 = y-(y&(y-1))
        x1 = x-(x&(x-1))
        sum = x1 + y1
        return [((sum&(sum-1)) == 0), min(y1, x1)]

The first value returned is a boolean specifying whether the point should be generated by a diamond or a square step; and the second value specifies the grid size of the step. It works great, except when x or y is zero—then the returned step size is zero and the script loops. However, if I tile the fractal into a 2x2 grid and specify points by clicking in the lower-right copy of the tile (i.e., away from the window's zero axes), the entire fractal will generate perfectly. But I can’t seem to ""fake"" this result by adding a multiple of the tile size to the mouse coordinates, or anything along those lines.

Any suggestions?

",python,algorithm,graphics,fractals,,,open,0,1342,7,"Issue with ""inside-out"" implementation of diamond-square fractal I'm working on a Python script that generates a (wrapping) diamond-square fractal in the reverse of the usual order: Instead of starting from the outside corners and subdividing into smaller squares, it starts from an arbitrary point and works recursively outward, generating only the points on which the final value depends. Here’s the function I've written to determine how to treat each point:

    def stepinfo(x, y):
        y1 = y-(y&(y-1))
        x1 = x-(x&(x-1))
        sum = x1 + y1
        return [((sum&(sum-1)) == 0), min(y1, x1)]

The first value returned is a boolean specifying whether the point should be generated by a diamond or a square step; and the second value specifies the grid size of the step. It works great, except when x or y is zero—then the returned step size is zero and the script loops. However, if I tile the fractal into a 2x2 grid and specify points by clicking in the lower-right copy of the tile (i.e., away from the window's zero axes), the entire fractal will generate perfectly. But I can’t seem to ""fake"" this result by adding a multiple of the tile size to the mouse coordinates, or anything along those lines.

Any suggestions?

I just found out about an app called [Django-crispy forms][2]. They give you [this snippet][3] to create [this form][4]

**My question is:**

Is it possible to combine my snippet with django-crispy to create a form which looks like this? I know that i have to use [django-tagging][5].

The parts I want to save is a map that's on certain coordinates of another map, and a selection of values like 'fov1' and 'fov2' which may or may not exist for any given coordinate. For instance, on ""minimap"" at x=50 and y=100, there may be another map, and I want that saving. Minimap[50][100] may also have, for instance, a list for fov0 and fov1, but not anything else. The max fov value is fov75.

Here are my save/load functions. 

This save function is meant see which maps need saving (those which are not blank, and not currently saved), then to save the map as Xcoord + 'x' + Ycoord (eg '50x100') and save the fov parts as Xcoord + 'x' + Ycoord + 'f' + the number of the fov, (eg '50x100f2'). That all works fine. I also then want it to delete the map that's being held in RAM at that point, and to delete all the fov segments that exist so that the memory can be freed up. That also appears to work.

    def save_maps():
    file = shelve.open(savename, 'w')
    for x in range(200):
        for y in range(200):
            if minimap[x][y].map is not 'blank' and minimap[x][y].map is not 'saved':
                mapname = str(x) + 'x' + str(y)
                file[mapname] = minimap[x][y].map
                minimap[x][y].map = 'saved'
                for p in range(76):
                    try:
                        fov = getattr(minimap[x][y], 'fov' + str(p))
                        fovname = str(x) + 'x' + str(y) + 'f' + str(p)
                        file[fovname] = fov
                        delattr(minimap[x][y], 'fov' + str(p))
                    except:
                        pass
    file.close()

Meanwhile, here's the load function, meant to bring up the map, all the fovs, and put them back in. Again, this works perfectly.

    def load_map(x, y):
    file = shelve.open(savename, 'w')
    mapname = str(x) + 'x' + str(y)
    minimap[x][y].map = file[mapname] 
    for p in range(76):
        try:
            fovname = str(x) + 'x' + str(y) + 'f' + str(p)
            setattr(minimap[x][y], 'fov' + str(p), file[fovname])
        except:
            pass
    file.close()

However, the weirdness is with RAM usage, as I've been watching task manager as I test it. Simply saving a single map actually INCREASES the RAM python is using! Surely that can't be right? Alternatively, if I save a large chunk at once, the RAM goes down as it should, but then if I load them all back up, the RAM is then significantly higher than it was before they were ever saved. If I then save/load again, the RAM doesn't go up; it only increases on the first save/load cycle, then never again. I've been working on this all day and cannot work out what is causing this strangeness, and how it can be resolved. Can anyone help me out?

For instance, on ""minimap"" at x=50 and y=100, there may be another map, and I want that saving. Minimap[50][100] may also have, for instance, a list for fov0 and fov1, but not anything else. The max fov value is fov75.

Here are my save/load functions. 

This save function is meant see which maps need saving (those which are not blank, and not currently saved), then to save the map as Xcoord + 'x' + Ycoord (eg '50x100') and save the fov parts as Xcoord + 'x' + Ycoord + 'f' + the number of the fov, (eg '50x100f2'). That all works fine. I also then want it to delete the map that's being held in RAM at that point, and to delete all the fov segments that exist so that the memory can be freed up. That also appears to work.

    def save_maps():
    file = shelve.open(savename, 'w')
    for x in range(200):
        for y in range(200):
            if minimap[x][y].map is not 'blank' and minimap[x][y].map is not 'saved':
                mapname = str(x) + 'x' + str(y)
                file[mapname] = minimap[x][y].map
                minimap[x][y].map = 'saved'
                for p in range(76):
                    try:
                        fov = getattr(minimap[x][y], 'fov' + str(p))
                        fovname = str(x) + 'x' + str(y) + 'f' + str(p)
                        file[fovname] = fov
                        delattr(minimap[x][y], 'fov' + str(p))
                    except:
                        pass
    file.close()

Meanwhile, here's the load function, meant to bring up the map, all the fovs, and put them back in. Again, this works perfectly.

    def load_map(x, y):
    file = shelve.open(savename, 'w')
    mapname = str(x) + 'x' + str(y)
    minimap[x][y].map = file[mapname] 
    for p in range(76):
        try:
            fovname = str(x) + 'x' + str(y) + 'f' + str(p)
            setattr(minimap[x][y], 'fov' + str(p), file[fovname])
        except:
            pass
    file.close()

However, the weirdness is with RAM usage, as I've been watching task manager as I test it. Simply saving a single map actually INCREASES the RAM python is using! Surely that can't be right? Alternatively, if I save a large chunk at once, the RAM goes down as it should, but then if I load them all back up, the RAM is then significantly higher than it was before they were ever saved. If I then save/load again, the RAM doesn't go up; it only increases on the first save/load cycle, then never again. I've been working on this all day and cannot work out what is causing this strangeness, and how it can be resolved. Can anyone help me out?

So I have a C++ struct (py_db_manager) containing pointers to a database object and a object manager object (both written in C++) that I wrapped with a python type object (t_db_manager). My problem is that this python type needs to know how to pickle the two pointers in order to send it to some child multicore  processes. So I registered the type with the copy_reg module (this is equivalent to writing a __reduce__() method on the type. However, I'm not too sure what to put in it. Should I build a tuple with the PyObject* or just the integer pointers?. Can anyone help?

    {
      PyObject_HEAD
      PyObject* man_inst_ ;
      PyObject* db_inst_ ;
      
    }py_db_manager;`

Here's the Py_TypeObject 

    PyTypeObject t_db_manager = {
        PyObject_HEAD_INIT(0)               /* tp_head */
        0,                                  /* tp_internal */
        "".py_db_manager"",                  /* tp_name */

So I have a C++ struct (py_db_manager) containing pointers to a database object and a object manager object (both written in C++) that I wrapped with a python type object (t_db_manager). My problem is that this python type needs to know how to pickle the two pointers in order to send it to some child multicore  processes. So I registered the type with the copy_reg module (this is equivalent to writing a __reduce__() method on the type. However, I'm not too sure what to put in it. Should I build a tuple with the PyObject* or just the integer pointers?. Can anyone help?

Most code is quite easy to convert but I have been struggling with one particular Matlab ""pattern"" for which I have yet to find an equivalent Numpy pattern.

Unfortunately this code tends to be where most of the time is spent in my Matlab scripts so I want to find an efficient Numpy equivalent.

The basic pattern consists of mapping a subset onto a larger grid. I have a set of key value pairs stored as parallel arrays and I want to insert these values into a larger list of key value pairs stored in the same way.

For concreteness say I have quarterly GDP data that I map onto a monthly time grid as follows.

    quarters = [200712 200803 200806 200809 200812 200903];

    gdp_m(loc(tf)) = gdp_q(tf);

Note that not all the quarters appear in the list of months so both the _tf_ and the _loc_ variables are required.

I have seen similar questions on StackOverflow but they either just give a pure Python solution ([here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3824778/equivalent-of-ismember-from-matlab-in-python)) or where numpy is used then the _loc_ argument isn't returned ([here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1273041/how-can-i-implement-matlabs-ismember-command-in-python)).

When i run it i see the command line but nothing else works. I can write commands but they don't seem to work. I see nothing at the console.

Now I want to expose my structures in boost::python as well, and automatically create the constructors (via boost::python::init<>) without having to duplicate the list of types already configured with fusion.  boost::python::init<> is supposed to take an MPL vector of types, but the only examples I have seen enter the list directly in the template arguments.

For instance, I would like to do something like:

     // this is from the fusion documentation
    BOOST_FUSION_DEFINE_STRUCT((demo), employee, (std::string, name)(int, age))
 
    namespace python = boost::python;
    
    // expose employee to python
    typedef boost::mpl::i_have_no_idea<demo::employee>::value_type cargs;
    python::class_<demo::employee>(""employee"", python::init<cargs>());

but I do not know how to get the MPL vector out of the fusion structure (that is the ""i_have_no_idea<>"" step), and the python::init<>() does not work either:

    typedef boost::mpl::vector<std::string, int> cargs;
    python::class_<demo::employee>(""employee"", python::init<cargs>());

That actually compiles, but the constructor signature gets the MPL vector type, not a string and an int like I want.

While we are at it, is it possible to extract the field names (name, age in this example) and convert to strings for use in exposing the member variables via python::class_::add_property()?

So to summarize the question, I want to automatically expose a fusion defined structure into python, exposing the constructor and member variables that fusion already knows.
",python,boost,metaprogramming,fusion,,,open,0,247,6,"Is boost::python automation from boost::fusion possible? I have a whole bunch of fusion structures defined with BOOST_FUSION_DEFINE_STRUCT that I can successfully parse and generate with boost::spirit.

Now I want to expose my structures in boost::python as well, and automatically create the constructors (via boost::python::init<>) without having to duplicate the list of types already configured with fusion.  boost::python::init<> is supposed to take an MPL vector of types, but the only examples I have seen enter the list directly in the template arguments.

For instance, I would like to do something like:

     // this is from the fusion documentation
    BOOST_FUSION_DEFINE_STRUCT((demo), employee, (std::string, name)(int, age))
 
    namespace python = boost::python;
    
    // expose employee to python
    typedef boost::mpl::i_have_no_idea<demo::employee>::value_type cargs;
    python::class_<demo::employee>(""employee"", python::init<cargs>());

but I do not know how to get the MPL vector out of the fusion structure (that is the ""i_have_no_idea<>"" step), and the python::init<>() does not work either:

    typedef boost::mpl::vector<std::string, int> cargs;
    python::class_<demo::employee>(""employee"", python::init<cargs>());

That actually compiles, but the constructor signature gets the MPL vector type, not a string and an int like I want.

Im using a QTableView with a QSqlTableModel everything works as intended.
The last column of the view contains only 0 and 1 as value which i want to display as checkbox and this column should be editable.

Ive read that you should subclass QItemDelegate which i did. Unluckily my table wont show the last column as a checkbox.

I tried to set the delegate only for the last column (the way i would prefer) using setItemDelegateForColumn(), it didnt work. So i modified it and set it for the entire QTableView using setItemDelegate() reacting only to requests to the last column. It still wont work. Wont work means there are no error messages it just wont do what i say ;) It seems that none of the methods i reimplemented gets ever called except __init__(). So i guess im missing something fundamental.

Ive extracted the relevant lines of code, KSCheckBoxDelegate is my subclass. This is the version where the delegate is set up for the entire QTableView.
<pre><code>
-- code from applications main class --
self.taglist = QTableView()
self.tagmodel = QSqlTableModel()
self.tagmodel.setTable(""data"")
self.tagmodel.select()
self.taglist.setModel(self.tagmodel)
print self.taglist.itemDelegate()
myDel = KSCheckBoxDelegate(self)
myDel.colnumber = 3
self.taglist.setItemDelegate(myDel)


-- KSCheckBoxDelegate.py --
from PyQt4.QtGui import *

class KSCheckBoxDelegate(QStyledItemDelegate):
	
	colnumber = None
	
	def __init__ (self, parent = None):
		print ""KSCheckBoxDelegate::init""
		QStyledItemDelegate.__init__(self, parent)
		
	def createEditor(self, parent, option, index):
		print ""KSCheckBoxDelegate::createEditor""
		if index.column()==self.colnumber:
			return QCheckBox(self)
		else:
			return QStyledItemDelegate.createEditor(self, parent, option, index)
			
	def setEditorData (self, editor, index):
		print ""KSCheckBoxDelegate::setEditorData""
		if index.column() == self.colnumber:
			cont = index.model().data(index, Qt.DisplayRole).toString()
			if cont == ""1"":
				editor.setCheckState(Qt.Checked)
			else:
				editor.setCheckState(Qt.UnChecked)
		else:
			QStyledItemDelegate.setEditorData(self,editor, index)
			
	def setModelData (self, editor, model, index):
		print ""KSCheckBoxDelegate::setModelData""
		if index.column() == self.colnumber:
			if editor.checkBox.checkState() == Qt.Checked:
				model.setData(index, 1)
			else:
				model.setData(index, 0)
		else:
			QStyledItemDelegate.setModelData(self, editor, model, index)
</code></pre>

Any hints for me on that issue?

Furthermore i have difficulties with the currentChanged() signal of the QTableViews selectionModel. Im printing the top right coordinates of the selection. I keep getting wrong indexes (not invalid) when clicking with the left mouse button. Using the cursor keys gets me the right indexes. Using selectionChanged() has the same behaviour. Im actually getting the coordinates of the second last selected cell of the QTableView. For instance im clicking on the coordinates <1,1> <2,1> the second click would show me the coordinates <1,1>.
<pre><code>
selInd = self.taglist.selectionModel().selectedIndexes()
if(len(selInd) > 0):
	self.xPosData=selInd[0].column()
	self.yPosData=selInd[0].row()

And last off using OnManualSubmit as editStrategy doesnt throw an error (return false) when calling submitAll() but doesnt save the data either. It works with choosing OnFieldChange as editStrategy. Which i can live with but is not was i have intended to do.

Horst",python,pyqt,,,,,open,0,383,7,"Cant get a custom ItemDelegate to work first off, im new to python and pyqt so please bear with me.

Im using a QTableView with a QSqlTableModel everything works as intended.
The last column of the view contains only 0 and 1 as value which i want to display as checkbox and this column should be editable.

Ive read that you should subclass QItemDelegate which i did. Unluckily my table wont show the last column as a checkbox.

I tried to set the delegate only for the last column (the way i would prefer) using setItemDelegateForColumn(), it didnt work. So i modified it and set it for the entire QTableView using setItemDelegate() reacting only to requests to the last column. It still wont work. Wont work means there are no error messages it just wont do what i say ;) It seems that none of the methods i reimplemented gets ever called except __init__(). So i guess im missing something fundamental.

Ive extracted the relevant lines of code, KSCheckBoxDelegate is my subclass. This is the version where the delegate is set up for the entire QTableView.
<pre><code>
-- code from applications main class --
self.taglist = QTableView()
self.tagmodel = QSqlTableModel()
self.tagmodel.setTable(""data"")
self.tagmodel.select()
self.taglist.setModel(self.tagmodel)
print self.taglist.itemDelegate()
myDel = KSCheckBoxDelegate(self)
myDel.colnumber = 3
self.taglist.setItemDelegate(myDel)


-- KSCheckBoxDelegate.py --
from PyQt4.QtGui import *

class KSCheckBoxDelegate(QStyledItemDelegate):
	
	colnumber = None
	
	def __init__ (self, parent = None):
		print ""KSCheckBoxDelegate::init""
		QStyledItemDelegate.__init__(self, parent)
		
	def createEditor(self, parent, option, index):
		print ""KSCheckBoxDelegate::createEditor""
		if index.column()==self.colnumber:
			return QCheckBox(self)
		else:
			return QStyledItemDelegate.createEditor(self, parent, option, index)
			
	def setEditorData (self, editor, index):
		print ""KSCheckBoxDelegate::setEditorData""
		if index.column() == self.colnumber:
			cont = index.model().data(index, Qt.DisplayRole).toString()
			if cont == ""1"":
				editor.setCheckState(Qt.Checked)
			else:
				editor.setCheckState(Qt.UnChecked)
		else:
			QStyledItemDelegate.setEditorData(self,editor, index)
			
	def setModelData (self, editor, model, index):
		print ""KSCheckBoxDelegate::setModelData""
		if index.column() == self.colnumber:
			if editor.checkBox.checkState() == Qt.Checked:
				model.setData(index, 1)
			else:
				model.setData(index, 0)
		else:
			QStyledItemDelegate.setModelData(self, editor, model, index)
</code></pre>

Any hints for me on that issue?

Furthermore i have difficulties with the currentChanged() signal of the QTableViews selectionModel. Im printing the top right coordinates of the selection. I keep getting wrong indexes (not invalid) when clicking with the left mouse button. Using the cursor keys gets me the right indexes. Using selectionChanged() has the same behaviour. Im actually getting the coordinates of the second last selected cell of the QTableView. For instance im clicking on the coordinates <1,1> <2,1> the second click would show me the coordinates <1,1>.
<pre><code>
selInd = self.taglist.selectionModel().selectedIndexes()
if(len(selInd) > 0):
	self.xPosData=selInd[0].column()
	self.yPosData=selInd[0].row()
</code></pre>

The project runs ok. The only problem really is Ldap is not supported by GAE. I mean:

    import ldap

will generate a server error. Nonetheless, I do know that I could make my own modules available through zipimport.

Strings can be three things: an acknowledgement, signalling one side that the other on is still alive; a pickled class containing a command, if going from the ""client"" to the ""server"", or a response, if going from the ""server"" to the ""client""; and finally a ""lock"" command, that signals a side of the conversation that the other is working and no further questions should be asked until another lock packet is received. 

I have been looking at the python's built in SocketServer.TCPServer, but it's way too low level, it does not easily support reconnection and the client has to use the socket interface, which i preferred to be encapsulated.   
I then explored the twisted framework, particularly the LineOnlyReceiver protocol and server examples, but i found the initial learning curve to be too steep, the online documentation assuming a little too much knowledge and a general lack of examples and good documentation (except the 2005 O'reilly book, is this still valid?).  
I then tryied the pyliblo library, which is perfect for the task, alas it is monodirectional, there is no way to ""answer"" a client, and i need the answer to be associated to the specific command.

So my question is: is there an existing framework/library/module that allows me to have a client object in the server, to read the commands from and send the replies to, and a server object in the client, to read the replies from and send the commands to, that i can use after a simple setup (client, the server address is host:port, server, you are listening on port X) having the underlying socket, reconnection engine and so on handled?

The Microsoft Access database comes from a third-party; I am only reading the data.

I have boiled it down to a simple query, of the form:

    SELECT field1 FROM table WHERE field1 = 601 AND field2 = 9067

I've obfuscated the field names and values but really, it doesn't get much more trivial than that! When I run the query in Access, it returns one record. 

Then I run it over pyodbc, with code that looks like this:

    connection = pyodbc.connect(connectionString)
    rows = self.connection.execute(queryString).fetchall()

(Again, it doesn't get much more trivial than that!)

The value of queryString is cut-and-pasted from the working query in Access, but it returns *no* records. I expected it to return the same record.

When I change the query to search for a different value for field2, bingo, it works. It is only some values it rejects.

So, please help me out. Where should I be looking next to explain this discrepancy?  If I can't trust the results of trivial queries, I don't have a chance on this project!

We're considering using Python (IronPython, but I don't think that's relevant) to provide a sort of 'macro' support for another application, which controls a piece of equipment.

We'd like to write fairly simple functions in Python, which take a few arguments - these would be things like times and temperatures and positions.   Different functions would take different arguments, and the main application would contain user interface (something like a property grid) which allows the users to provide values for the Python function arguments.

So, for example function1 might take a time and a temperature, and function2 might take a position and a couple of times.

We'd like to be able to dynamically build the user interface from the Python code.  Things which are easy to do are to find a list of functions in a module, and (using inspect.getargspec) to get a list of arguments to each function.

However, just a list of argument names is not really enough - ideally we'd like to be able to include some more information about each argument - for instance, it's 'type' (high-level type - time, temperature, etc, not lanaguage-level type), and perhaps a 'friendly name' or description.

So, the question is, what are good 'pythonic' ways of adding this sort of information to a function.

The two possibilities I have thought of are:

* Use a strict naming convention for arguments, and then infer stuff about them from their names (fetched using getargspec)

* Invent our own docstring meta-language (could be little more than CSV) and use the docstring for our metadata.

Because Python seems pretty popular for building scripting into large apps, I imagine this is a solved problem with some common conventions, but I haven't been able to find them.

However, just a list of argument names is not really enough - ideally we'd like to be able to include some more information about each argument - for instance, it's 'type' (high-level type - time, temperature, etc, not lanaguage-level type), and perhaps a 'friendly name' or description.

So, the question is, what are good 'pythonic' ways of adding this sort of information to a function.

The two possibilities I have thought of are:

* Use a strict naming convention for arguments, and then infer stuff about them from their names (fetched using getargspec)

* Invent our own docstring meta-language (could be little more than CSV) and use the docstring for our metadata.

Because Python seems pretty popular for building scripting into large apps, I imagine this is a solved problem with some common conventions, but I haven't been able to find them.

This game is right now made out of 3 files: main.py, cellBoard.py, cell.py

main.py takes care to instance cellboard and make it update its data, give it mouse input, and tell it to draw itself (an instance of the pygame surface is given to it, which handles it to the cells which are the actual ones that draw themselves)

cellboard.py creates a list of cells based off their size and the screen's size, to fill it properly. It's a 2D list. When it creates the cells it sets their state (alive currently) and handles them an instance of its instance of the original surface instance.

cell.py contains all the things a cell can do: die, live, be toggled, be drawn.

In fact, when I need to draw the whole board I just call cellBoard's own draw() and it should take care of calling each cell's draw. And it does.
The execution gets to the point where the cell should be drawn (checked with prints) and the pixel filling function is executed (using a for loop to cover an area). But nothing is actually drawn to the screen, or at least nothing is visible.

I have no idea what is causing this. I checked the code multiple times, I've even rewritten the whole program from scratch to make it more tidy (and I had the same problem as now)

What is causing this? My idea would be that somehow the instance of surface Cell gets is not good anymore to work because something happened to it (it goes through cellboard before getting to each cell, could that be the problem?)

In order to keep it on the desired interval in spite of scheduling shenanigans, I keep track of when the program started and the time when each interval should end so that I can sleep for however long the program needs to reach the next interval.

This system works totally fine with my laptop running Vista and another computer running XP, but when I copy/paste the program on a third computer running XP it sleeps for anywhere from 20-40 seconds when given a 10 second interval! This is especially strange since I've set it so that if it's missed an interval it should attempt to take another measurement immediately, but I'm not seeing anything to indicate that that is happening. I've reinstalled python 2.7.2 but the program still has the exact same problem. 

I've checked all the processes and services on the problem computer and there's nothing out of the ordinary and nothing using up any system resources. Is there any reason why time.sleep would sleep for so long?

Here's the code segment in question.  In my program it was running independently in three threads. cycles is an int counter initialized to zero, self.delay is a float holding the user-specified delay, in this case 10.0 seconds.

            cycles += 1
            currentTime = time.clock()
            wakeUp = startTime + cycles * self.delay
            
            if currentTime > wakeUp:  #we overslept
                continue
            else:
                #not guaranteed to sleep for the exact specified amount of time
                time.sleep(float(wakeUp - currentTime))
            finalTime = time.clock()
            print ""sleep("" + str(wakeUp - currentTime) + "") lasted "" + str(finalTime - currentTime) +"" seconds""



And here's the output it gave (again, this is from three threads running the same code at once):

",python,time,sleep,,,,open,0,510,8,"What Could Cause time.sleep() to be Horrifically Inaccurate? I have a program that takes measurements in a user-specified interval. In order to keep it on the desired interval in spite of scheduling shenanigans, I keep track of when the program started and the time when each interval should end so that I can sleep for however long the program needs to reach the next interval.

This system works totally fine with my laptop running Vista and another computer running XP, but when I copy/paste the program on a third computer running XP it sleeps for anywhere from 20-40 seconds when given a 10 second interval! This is especially strange since I've set it so that if it's missed an interval it should attempt to take another measurement immediately, but I'm not seeing anything to indicate that that is happening. I've reinstalled python 2.7.2 but the program still has the exact same problem.

Python, numpy and ipython work fine, but matplotlib has misteriously vanished. After repeatedly trying to install it from macports, egg, and others, I have managed to do it through their provided .dmg. Now apparently, matplotlib doesn't support 64 bit architecture (?????). Anyway, though maybe someone here had been through a similar problem. So, my specs: MAC OS x 10.7.2, python 2.7 out of the box, numpy 1.5.1 and matplotlib 1.1.0. Here's the output:

I want to look for

    my_string = ""nFOIL: integrating Naïve Bayes and FOIL""

and find the right row. You see it has to be a case insensitive search and the dot at the end is missing in the query. How do I implement this?

I tried

    SELECT id FROM papers WHERE UPPER(title) LIKE %s

and converted my_string to upper case in python and put a ""%"" at the end of my_string but this doesn't seam a good way of handling this. It did not work too. =)

I have this idea to create a live stream coding software, it is basically they can see what I type in the text editor, on their computer screen. I am doing python tutorial and I would like to show the code to the 1st year students as they are following along.

1) Whenever I press save, it update on their screen.
- seems to be the easiest to implement 
So every 10 seconds, the .py file will be uploaded to the server, and the client's side will be grabbing the file every 10 seconds and update it. Making it feels a little bit like live streaming. I hope to use Tkinter to implement the GUI, and make the synax high lights too. I don't know can I increase the update to every 0.5 seconds, so it can feel even better, but either way, the concept is like that.

If I would like to start this project in Python, what are the libraries I should be look into? Any suggestion or reference is appreciated.

I have read http://stackoverflow.com/questions/238081/how-do-you-log-server-errors-on-django-sites which seems to be the definitive answer on the subject, and have copied the configuration from the answer http://stackoverflow.com/a/6395837/1094910 into my `settings.py` (changing the output file for the WatchedFileHandler, of course; and adding my admin email address to `settings.ADMINS`).

Neither the AdminEmailHandler nor the WatchedFileHandler are doing what they're supposed to do when I induce an error 500 on the site.  I have set `settings.DEBUG` to `False` and have confirmed that Django can both send email and write to the file.  I've also tried logging directly from the Django shell:

    $ /usr/local/pythonenv/DJANGO/bin/python manage.py shell
    ...
    >>> import logging
    >>> l = logging.getLogger('django')
    >>> l.handlers[0]
    <logging.handlers.WatchedFileHandler instance at 0xcd3b48>
    >>> l.error(""This should write to a file"")
    >>> l = logging.getLogger('django.request')
    >>> l.handlers[0]
    <django.utils.log.AdminEmailHandler instance at 0xcd37e8>
    >>> l.error(""This should email the addresses in settings.ADMINS"")

Neither logger emits a peep in the above case.  

However, generic Python logging will work (for the file, at least), proving that it's not a file permission issue:

    $ python     # (or /usr/local/pythonenv/DJANGO/bin/python manage.py shell)
    ...
    >>> import logging
    >>> logging.basicConfig(filename='/path/to/same/file/as/above', level=logging.DEBUG)
    >>> logging.error(""This one shows up"")

As noted above, Django can and happily will send emails throughout the rest of my project, just not in this case.  

The WatchedFileHandler works on my local machine with the same configuration (except for file path of course); the AdminEmailHandler does not, but I suspect that is because I am using Gmail as an email server as described [here][1].  (Local machine is Windows 7; dev server on which the config doesn't work is Debian 6.0.3.)

I feel as though I'm missing something simple and obvious but have spent most of a day trying to figure out what it could be.  Any suggestions as to what configurations I might have missed, or what other troubleshooting I should try, to figure out why Python's logging works but Django's doesn't?

For example, if I want to create a MultiPoint geometry and determine which points are inside a Polygon using the Union() function, I run into problems, but the Python bindings are just generated by SWIG and all of the documentation is computer generated. I made this post because it struck me that there might be better libraries out there.

 - GeoDjango: Well this is again based on the GEOS C/C++ library, but it appears the interface might be intuitive, and possibly better documented. I also have the sense it is being actively updated. I'm not interested in web applications, but this doesn't seem to be an issue?

It isn't working at all how I expected.  It looks like even though i'm bootstrapping into pyramid, it isn't loading the right logs.  Specific problems below within test.py:

That's weird!  no handlers?  Apparently it's not the log I am thinking of.

    print log

    >>> logging.Logger

shouldn't it be a RootLogger?

    print log.parent

hmm so the parent of getLogger('root') is the real RootLogger?  let's see what its handlers are:

I am using zc.buildout to install an application which requires pymssql. Pymssql requires Cython in order to install properly. However, I would like to not modify my running environment, so I would like to do something like:

1. Install Cython
2. Load Cython into buildout
3. Install Pymssql.

I thought Buildout did this already, but it looks more like it checks the setup.cfg to ensure that anything that explicitly stated as necessary is installed. Current my buildout looks like:

    [buildout]
      parts = required-eggs
      ...

    [required-eggs]
      eggs = Cython
             pymssql

Cython installs fine. Unfortunately pymssql does not:

        return self.build_and_install(setup_script, setup_base)
      File ""/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/setuptools/command/easy_install.py"", line 1101, in build_and_install

Thus, I think that Cython is installed as an egg, but is not loaded into the python process that is running buildout. Is there some configuration in buildout that will allow me to do this?

I'd like to store non-db temporary data along side the ORM data and I don't want to pollute the mapped class namespace (which other people use) with a bunch of temporary attributes just so I can store some object specific data. What I would really like to do is to use these as keys into a dict.

I've seen [this thread](http://www.mail-archive.com/sqlalchemy@googlegroups.com/msg21227.html) so I know that it can be done, but I don't like the example of:

    def __hash__( self ):
        return id( self ) if self.id is None else hash( self.id )

Because my use case includes a db set auto_increment primary key which won't exist until after a flush. This is one of the no-noes of hashing.

I could try to fix it if I put a flush in the `__hash__` but that feels like way too big a side effect to be a good idea.

We have a race-car in a 2 dimensional track.
When I say 4 dimensional problem, I mean that each STATE is (x,y,vx,vy), meaning: position (x,y) and SPEED (vx,vy).
There's a starting state, and one or more goal states.
When you hit a ""wall"", you return to the initial state.

Since I want to encourage a solution with a few steps as possible, each passable block has a ""-1"" reward, a wall has ""NONE"" (like the GridMDP example), and the goal has ""0"".

An ACTION is 2 dimensional (a,b), meaning acceleration for axis x and for axis y accordingly.

I built a class, FourDimMDPClass that inherits from the MDP class, and makes the appropriate changes (similiar to what they did in the GridMDP class at the link above)

To make things easy for now, state transition is deterministic. Meaning, the T function returns the one desired state with probability 1 (or the starting state, if you hit a wall).

I solved the MDP using the provided value_iteration method, and then tried to get the right policy using best_policy method.

My problem is this:
For some reason, the returned policy is total nonsense.
There is one constant action that is returned for ALL states. This action is simply the first action in the action list.
When I change the order of the action list, the new first action is always returned.

This is what happens with a very simple and small track.

I've been trying to debug this many many hours now, with no progress.
I tried looking at all the values passed to the MDP mechanism, and they seem fine.

Help will be much appreciated.

I am writing this code in Python.<br>
I tried using PAM to do authentication. For this I downloaded a Python module called Python Pam. <br><br>
The code I use :<br.

    import pam   
    pam.authenticate('root',<password>,<service>)
where `<service>` is a config file I created in /etc/pam.d/
<br>
the file contains the following code<br>

    #%PAM-1.0
    auth     requisite      pam_unix.so
This code works on certain hosts giving the correct answer, but not on others <br>
Even if I replaced `<service>` with login or sshd as in

    pam.authenticate('root',<password>,'sshd')
It still returns False for a correct password on certain hosts. <br><br>
So does anybody know why this does not work. I don't need to use pam or any module. Is there any command in unix that I can invoke from Python which would just authenticate a username? and preferably work across all unix based systems including Linux, Solaris, HP-UX, AIX. <br>Thanks

The code I use :<br.

    import pam   
    pam.authenticate('root',<password>,<service>)
where `<service>` is a config file I created in /etc/pam.d/
<br>
the file contains the following code<br>

    #%PAM-1.0
    auth     requisite      pam_unix.so
This code works on certain hosts giving the correct answer, but not on others <br>
Even if I replaced `<service>` with login or sshd as in

    pam.authenticate('root',<password>,'sshd')
It still returns False for a correct password on certain hosts. <br><br>
So does anybody know why this does not work. I don't need to use pam or any module. Is there any command in unix that I can invoke from Python which would just authenticate a username? and preferably work across all unix based systems including Linux, Solaris, HP-UX, AIX. <br>Thanks

The main problem I see is being browser-based, so I think the script would have to call a scriptable browser, which has the actual canvas rendering engine. I don't even know if the concept of ""scriptable browser"" (via command line) exists at all.

What are the steps I have to take in order to compile BusyBox for the mipsel architecture? 2. How do I include the GLibc / Linux kernel versions for your TV in my BusyBox binary? 

Has anyone else gotten this trick to work successfully?

I have an external sampling system that records data at 5000Hz.  In order to get timestamps I take the initial time and then add (1.0/5000) to get the timestamp for successive samples.  I noticed very quickly the current time (time.time()) drifted away from the calculated time when using a loop.  just doing the simple calculation there was no noticeable drift - Some code:

    start_time = time.time()
    start_time_test = start_time
    #get 512 samples - takes 512*1.0/5000 seconds
    for i in arange(512):
       start_time = start_time + (1.0/5000) #5khz

     print time.time() - start_time_test #no drift
     print time.time() - start_time # drifts
     print start_time_test - start_time # constant increment

Now the difference between start_time_test and start_time is not insignificant - It's about 1.69e-5 per block of 512 which very quickly starts to add up.  I'm just surprised at quickly the floating point errors come into play here.  I'm going to investigate the use of the decimal pacakge here to restrict the errors.

Is this level of floating point error to be expected? - Please not that I could be doing something silly and it's not floating point errors.

It seems sensible to me to iterate over each row, process on-the-fly and then insert each new row into the new table on-the-fly.

    cursor1 = conn.cursor(MySQLdb.cursors.SSCursor)

Then I get a 2014 error:

So it doesn't seem to like starting another cursor while iterating over a server-side cursor. Which seems to leave me stuck with a very slow client-side iterator.

Any suggestions?

I am working on an desktop inbox notifier for StackOverflow, using the API with Python.

The script I am working on first logs the user in on StackExchange, and then requests authorisation for the application. Assuming the application has been authorised through web-browser interaction of the user. The application should be able to make requests to the API with authentication, hence it needs the access token specific to the user. This is done with the URL: `https://stackexchange.com/oauth/dialog?client_id=54&scope=read_inbox&redirect_uri=https://stackexchange.com/oauth/login_success`

When requesting authorisation via the web-browser the redirect is taking place and an access code is returned after a `#`. **However, when requesting this same URL with Python (urllib2), no hash or key is returned in the response.**

Why is it my urllib2 request is handled differently from the same request made in Firefox or W3m? What should I do to programmatically simulate this request and retrieve the `access_token`?

Here is my script (it's experimental) and remember: it assumes the user has already authorised the application.

The NPR show ""Car Talk"" has quizzes they call ""Puzzlers"". One is titled ""Getting to 100"". In the quiz, you write down the digits 1-9 in order, followed by "" = 100"", and then insert between them two minus symbols and one plus symbol (in any order) to make the formula correct. You aren't allowed to re-arrange digits, or do some toothpick math like combine two minus signs to make a plus. You must use every digit, and all three operators. For example, here's one incorrect solution:
123 + 45 - 67 - 89 = 100 (This is an incorrect formula; it totals 12)
You want to write a function that does the thinking for you. It should output every possible equation that can be formed, and the actual result of that equation. The equation(s) that result in 100 should have stars around them. At the end, you should print out the number(s) of formulae that were possible. Here's an excerpt of some example output:
 ... 1 -2- 3+456789 = 456785 1 -2+ 3-456789 = -456787 1 +2- 3-456789 = --456789 …

2: Your function can check every possible combination, but we can certainly eliminate certain equations before we even test them because we know it’s impossible for them to result in the correct answer (for answer, the first three and the last three equations (above) clearly cannot result in 100).

This data should be declared as a `char[]`, and it will be nice if it could be encoded as a string (with the pertinent escape sequences when they are not in the range of ASCII printable chars) to keep the header more compact than a decimal or hexadecimal array encoding.

The problem is that when I print the `repr` of a Python string, it is delimited by single quotes, and C doesn't like that. The naive solution is to do:

    '""%s""'%repr(data)[1:-1]

but that doesn't work when one of the bytes in the data happens to be a double quote, so I'd need them to be escaped too.

I think a simple `replace('""', '\\""')` could do the job, but maybe there's a better, more pythonic solution out there.

**Extra point**:

It would be convenient too to split the data in lines of approximately 80 characters, but again the simple approach of [splitting the source string in chunks][1] of size 80 won't work, as each non printable character takes 2 or 3 characters in the escape sequence. Splitting the list in chunks of 80 _after_ getting the repr won't help either, as it could divide escape sequence.

Any suggestions?

The implementation throws an exception when a contract (precondition/postcondition/invariant) is violated, but it doesn't provide you a quick way of identifying which specific contract has failed if there are multiple ones associated with a method. 

For example, if I take the [circbuf.py][2] example, and violate the precondition by passing in a negative argument, like so: 

    circbuf(-5)

Then I get a traceback that looks like this:


    Traceback (most recent call last):

My hunch is that the second argument in the PreconditionViolationError (4) refers to the line number in the circbuf.__init__ docstring that contains the assertion:

    def __init__(self, leng):
        """"""Construct an empty circular buffer.

    td2.seconds (ie 930) is equivalent to

My question is,since td1 is the duration from **previous midnight**
to 23:30:00 PM  and td2 is the duration from **that midnight**

My question is,since td1 is the duration from **previous midnight**
to 23:30:00 PM  and td2 is the duration from **that midnight**
 to 00:15:30 AM , how can their difference represent the duration between t2 and t1 ?

Can some python gurus explain

6868846,07/29/2011 05:03:29,811239,06/22/2011 21:57:36,13,0,Perl Vs Python variable Scoping - gotchas to be aware of,"While investigating **lexical and dynamic scoping in Perl and Python**, I came across a silent scoping related behavior of Perl that can cause bugs very difficult to trace.  I have provided example code for both Perl and Python to illustrate how scoping works in both the languages

In Python if we run the code:

        x = 30
        def g():
            s1 = x
            print ""Inside g(): Value of x is %d"" % s1
        
        
        def t(var):
            x = var
            print ""Inside t(): Value of x is %d"" % x
            def tt():
                s1 = x
                print ""Inside t()-tt(): Value of x is %d"" % x
            tt()
            g()
    
       t(200)

The resulting output is:

    Inside t(): Value of x is 200
    Inside t()-tt(): Value of x is 200
    Inside g(): Value of x is 30

This is the usual lexical scoping behavior.  The scope of the variable `x` in the function `g()` is determined by place in the program where it is defined, not where the function `g()` gets called.  As a result of lexical scoping behavior in Python when the function `g()` is called within the function `t()` where another lexically scoped variable `x` is also defined and set to the value of 200, `g()` still displays the old value 30, as that is the value of the variable x in scope where `g()` was defined.  The function `tt()` displays a value of 200 as the variable `x` that is in the the lexical scope of `tt()` has a value of 200.  Python has only lexical scoping and that is the default behavior.

By contrast Perl provides the flexibility of using lexical scoping as well as dynamic scoping.  Which can be a boon in some cases, but can also lead to hard to find bugs if the programmer is not careful and understands how scoping works in Perl.

To illustrate this subtle behavior, if we execute the following Perl code:

    use strict;
    my $x = 30;
    sub g { 
        my $s = $x; 
        print ""Inside g\(\)\: Value of x is ${s}\n"";
    }

I have provided example code for both Perl and Python to illustrate how scoping works in both the languages

In Python if we run the code:

        x = 30
        def g():
            s1 = x
            print ""Inside g(): Value of x is %d"" % s1
        
        
        def t(var):
            x = var
            print ""Inside t(): Value of x is %d"" % x
            def tt():
                s1 = x
                print ""Inside t()-tt(): Value of x is %d"" % x
            tt()
            g()
    
       t(200)

The resulting output is:

    Inside t(): Value of x is 200
    Inside t()-tt(): Value of x is 200
    Inside g(): Value of x is 30

This is the usual lexical scoping behavior.  The scope of the variable `x` in the function `g()` is determined by place in the program where it is defined, not where the function `g()` gets called.  As a result of lexical scoping behavior in Python when the function `g()` is called within the function `t()` where another lexically scoped variable `x` is also defined and set to the value of 200, `g()` still displays the old value 30, as that is the value of the variable x in scope where `g()` was defined.  The function `tt()` displays a value of 200 as the variable `x` that is in the the lexical scope of `tt()` has a value of 200.  Python has only lexical scoping and that is the default behavior.

By contrast Perl provides the flexibility of using lexical scoping as well as dynamic scoping.  Which can be a boon in some cases, but can also lead to hard to find bugs if the programmer is not careful and understands how scoping works in Perl.

To illustrate this subtle behavior, if we execute the following Perl code:

    use strict;
    my $x = 30;
    sub g { 
        my $s = $x; 
        print ""Inside g\(\)\: Value of x is ${s}\n"";
    }
    sub t {
        my $x = shift;
        print ""Inside t\(\)\: Value of x is ${x}\n"";
        sub tt {
            my $p = $x;
            print ""Inside t\(\)-tt\(\)\: Value of x is ${p}\n"";
        }
        tt($x);
        g();
    
    }
    t(500);

the resulting output is:

    Inside t(): Value of x is 500
    Inside t()-tt(): Value of x is 500
    Inside g(): Value of x is 30

Perl displays the lexical scoping behavior for the variable `$x` as in Python.  However, if the programmer omits mentioning the `my` in line 8 of this code, Perl silently treats the variable `$x` as a dynamically scoped variable and provides a different result.

Thus if we execute this code where the only change is the removal of the `my` declarator in line 8

    use strict;
    my $x = 30;
    sub g { 
        my $s = $x; 
        print ""Inside g\(\)\: Value of x is ${s}\n"";
    }
    sub t {
        $x = shift;
        print ""Inside t\(\)\: Value of x is ${x}\n"";
        sub tt {
            my $p = $x;
            print ""Inside t\(\)-tt\(\)\: Value of x is ${p}\n"";
        }

Anyway, the following code snippets show two helper functions, plus a sample main() type of function (which I always use, even in Perl and Python apps, since I have a C/C++/Java background).

The first helper method will auto-fit every used column on the given sheet.  Since the auto-fit logic depends on the data in the cells, as well as the font(s) in use, you shouldn't call this method until the entire sheet has been completely populated with your data.  Also, I'm pretty new to VBA, so I'm not so sure that this line:

			sheet.Cells(1, i).EntireColumn.AutoFit()

is correct, but it does seem to work just fine.  If it's not entirely correct, maybe you can post a correction.

The second helper is a ""freeze the top line"" method.  All it does is freeze the top line of the sheet that you pass it.  A side effect of this method is that the sheet becomes the active sheet in the spreadsheet, so you might need/want to activate some other sheet once all your sheets' top lines have been frozen.

One problem I have is that VPython becomes quite slow when rendering a great many objects (at least on my non-3d accelerated Linux laptop), making visual inspection of complicated models quite difficult.

I've been trying to use an external tool for visualization, but the problem is that I'm a bit lost in the sea of possible file formats and available tools. I've been trying MeshLab for instance, which works great for displaying point cloud data in simple ascii formats, but I couldn't decide in which compatible format to export my other types of geometry, to superimpose on the point cloud layer.

Here are the requirements for my whole pipeline:

 - The point cloud data may contain millions of points, stored as simple xyz ascii coords
 - The modeling primitives are primarily lines and cylinders (i.e. no polygons), numbered in the thousands
 - The visualization tool should ideally be cross-platform (it must run at least on Linux)
 - There should be a Python module for easy data import/export of the chosen file format (or the format is simple enough to write a simple converter, if not)

I've been googling a lot about this so I have tentative answers for all of these, but none that is 100% satisfying in my context. Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated.. many thanks in advance!

Let's say I have two iterators ""iter1"" and ""iter2"": perhaps a prime number generator, and itertools.count().  I know a priori that both are are infinite and monotonically increasing.  Now I want to take some simple operation of two args ""op"" (perhaps operator.add or operator.mul), and calculate every element of the first iterator with every element of the next, using said operation.  Obviously, this is an infinite sequence itself.

What is the best way to:

 - wrap-up ""iter1"", ""iter2"", and ""op"" in an iterable that itself yields the values in monotonically increasing output.

Allowable simplifying assumptions:

 - If it helps, we can assume op(a,b) >= a and op(a,b) >= b.
 - If it helps, we can assume op(a,b) > op(a,c) for all b > c.

Also allowable:

 - Also acceptable would be an iterator that yields values in ""generally increasing"" order... by which I mean the iterable could occasionally give me a number less than a previous one, but it would somehow make ""side information"" available (as via a method on the object) that would say ""I'm not guarenteeing the next value I give you will be greater than the one I just gave you, but I AM SURE that all future values will at least be greater than N."".... and ""N"" itself is monotonically increasing.

The only way I can think to do this is a sort of ""diagonalization"" process, where I keep an increasing number of partially processed iterables around, and ""look ahead"" for the minimum of all the possible next() values, and yield that.  But this weird agglomeration of a heapq and a bunch of deques just seems outlandish, even before I start to code it.

Please: do *not* base your answer on the fact that my examples mentioned primes or count().... I have several uses for this very concept that are NOT related to primes and count().

I only need to calculate one digit of Pi at a time. <b>How can I determine the lowest I can set D, the ""number of digits of working precision""? </b>

D=4 gives me many correct digits, but a few digits will be off by one. For example, computing digit 393 with precision of 4 gives me 0xafda, from which I extract the digit 0xa. However, the correct digit is 0xb.

No matter how high I set D, it seems that testing a sufficient number of digits finds an one where the formula returns an incorrect value.
