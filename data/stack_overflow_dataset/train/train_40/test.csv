In our Java app we have a bunch of `where` clause filter criteria (database column, operand, value).  In other words, we could have a `Date` instance that we need to use to filter a given `datetime` Oracle column, a `String` instance that we need to use to query a `varchar2` column, an `Integer` instance for a `number` column, etc.

Is there a library that will take a base query (`select a,b,c from d`) and some filter criteria and output sql in a valid format?  By valid format, I'd mean that the `String` filters would be surrounded by quotes, the `Integer` values wouldn't be surrounded by quotes, the `Date` values formatted using `to_date`, etc.  Something like this:

    select a, b, c from table --base query
    where
    date_col > to_date('2003/07/09 13:15', 'yyyy/mm/dd HH24:MM') and --Date 
    int_col = 5 and --Integer
    string_col = 'abc'

We weren't planning on using `PreparedStatement`-s as it seems like this would be harder to use to generate dynamic sql.  We are only doing `select`-s (don't need to worry about [sql injection][1] attacks).

    SELECT AutoKey, OnHand FROM ONNM(XLOCK) CROSS JOIN OITM(XLOCK)
    WHERE ObjectCode IN ('20', '10000048') AND ItemCode = @ItemCode

the key feature being the CROSS JOIN used to include multiple tables in a single query. I confirmed that if an exclusive lock already exists on the OITM row for @ItemCode in another transaction, then this statement doesn't introduce any lock on ONNM until it can acquire both locks. However, in the more complex full test run, SQL profiler returns some conflicting information. I have imported the SQL profiler results into a table and executed the following query:

    select rownum, e.name, EventClass, TextData, SPID, ClientProcessID from #pmit t
    join sys.trace_events e on t.EventClass = e.trace_event_id
    where rownum between 275799 and 546130

My question is, why was it possible (is it normal) for SPID 78 to acquire a lock on OITM (ca73a6396124) (which happens to represent ItemCode FC1 if I recall correctly) even though it could not acquire a lock on ONNM (36fa3e654c8f). Is my assumption that SQL statements get all-or-none locks incorrect? Does it not hold if the holder of the ONNM lock was a shared lock on a different connection within a transaction that contains multiple connections in the other process? (I think SPID 99 is another connection in the same process as SPID 114.)

This seems to be a really complicated problem to decipher; I don't know if there's a better way of going about deadlock avoidance or finding out what happened here.",sql,sql-server,locking,deadlock,,06/29/2012 23:52:26,off topic,1,2715,7,"All-or-none exclusive lock on 2 SQL tables My simplistic testing suggested that I can acquire an exclusive lock on 2 tables or postpone acquiring the lock on either until both can be acquired at once by using a query like this:

    SELECT AutoKey, OnHand FROM ONNM(XLOCK) CROSS JOIN OITM(XLOCK)
    WHERE ObjectCode IN ('20', '10000048') AND ItemCode = @ItemCode

the key feature being the CROSS JOIN used to include multiple tables in a single query. I confirmed that if an exclusive lock already exists on the OITM row for @ItemCode in another transaction, then this statement doesn't introduce any lock on ONNM until it can acquire both locks. However, in the more complex full test run, SQL profiler returns some conflicting information. I have imported the SQL profiler results into a table and executed the following query:

    select rownum, e.name, EventClass, TextData, SPID, ClientProcessID from #pmit t
    join sys.trace_events e on t.EventClass = e.trace_event_id
    where rownum between 275799 and 546130
    and (TextData LIKE '(ca73a6396124)' or TextData LIKE '(36fa3e654c8f)'
         or TextData LIKE '%(XLOCK)%' or TextData LIKE '%DeadLock%')
    order by rownum

And these are the results I got back:

My question is, why was it possible (is it normal) for SPID 78 to acquire a lock on OITM (ca73a6396124) (which happens to represent ItemCode FC1 if I recall correctly) even though it could not acquire a lock on ONNM (36fa3e654c8f). Is my assumption that SQL statements get all-or-none locks incorrect? Does it not hold if the holder of the ONNM lock was a shared lock on a different connection within a transaction that contains multiple connections in the other process? (I think SPID 99 is another connection in the same process as SPID 114.)

This seems to be a really complicated problem to decipher; I don't know if there's a better way of going about deadlock avoidance or finding out what happened here.",4

For each record coming from 'Source', one record is created in 'Detail'. Records are also created in 'Summary' based on an aggregate of the detail records. This is all pretty straightforward, I think, except that I need to relate records in 'Detail' to the corresponding records in 'Summary'.

I've 'solved' this problem with a pair of temporary holding tables (corresponding to the destination tables) along with a semi-complicated UPDATE statement to relate them by matching on grouping fields (the _real_ example has a much more complicated grouping). I can't help but feel there exists a simpler solution than what I've created.

Thanks for any ideas.",3

The reason i have two SELECTs is to make sure i get the latest revision of the post.  First i try the revision SELECT to see if i get a row returned - if I do, i'm done.  If there is no row (no revisions on the post), use the second SELECT statement.

Using the 'Data Sources (ODBC)' application within the Administrative Tools group on Windows Control Panel, I setup a database (Windows folder) which has tables (tab-delimited files) with the Microsoft Text Driver.

The current table of interest has a 'Date' field (called 'DateTime') where dates are formatted '%Y/%m/%d'.  When I first tried to query the database with conditions on this field, I was returned a result set with zero observations.  So, I changed 'DateTime' to datatype 'Character' and tried my query again (to no avail).

I am able to successfully query the database, i.e.

`sqlQuery(channel = cn, query = ""SELECT * FROM large_table.txt"", as.is = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE, max = 20)` 

returns results.  The following queries return result sets with zero observations (I have verified that there is at least one record with the the value '2011/04/01' in its 'DateTime' field).

My questions is regarding the database design.

I have some event running indefinitely however sometimes the end date is known. Lets say i am creating one event to take one medicine so i know when it is going to start but i don't know when it need to be stopped, it will depend on the progress and how the doctor advises.

Now the interesting bit is, though i will be taking medicine everyday at particular time, for some day it can CHANGE (Time, Dose etc).

So, i will have one table storing the medication name, dose, start date etc. 

Questions:
1. Should there be physical record for each day [As its subject to change on particular date]. But there can be millions of record if we start to store for each date.

2. Alternatively, i can have exception for the date user is changing the details.

3. Or i can create record for 6 months and when the time will get closer either user can increase or system will increase automatically if the event is still going.

I wonder how Google calendar handles repeat indefinably.

Your suggestion will be appreciated.

I have a set of call detail records, and from those records, I'm supposed to determine the average concurrent active calls per system, per hour (at a precision of one minute). If I query 7pm to 8pm, I should see the average concurrent calls for the hour (averaging the concurrent calls for each minute) within that hour (for each system). 

So, I need a way to check for a count of active calls for 7:00-7:01, 7:01-7:02, etc then average those numbers. A call is considered active if the call's time and duration fall within the current minute being checked.

What makes this even more difficult is that it needs to span SQL 7.0 and SQL 2000 (some functions in 2000 aren't available in 7.0, such as GetUTCTime()), if I can just get 2000 working I'll be happy.

What approaches to this problem can I take?
----
 I thought about looping through minutes (60) in the hour being checked and adding the count of calls that fall between that minute and then somehow cross referencing the duration to make sure that a call that starts at 7:00 pm and has a duration of 300 seconds shows active at 7:04, but I can't imagine how to approach the problem. I tried to figure out a way to weight each call against particular minute that would tell me if the call was active during that minute or not, but couldn't come up with an effective solution.

I have a Table in MSSQL base with the following structure:

ID_Period, ID_Club, DateStart, DateEnd, Cash, Less, InWay

1, 1, 2010-08-01, 2010-08-31, 0, 0, 0

I wanna make query, that will choose last records, that are earlier, than the parameter date 
I enter, grouped by ID_Club, it means, that the result of the query will be like:

2, 1, 166013.01, 343697.42, 748231.00, 2010-02-28,

etc...

1 | 2 | This is a comment to someone saying Bonjour<br>
2 | 2 | This is another comment to Bonjour

What I'm trying to do is run one query that pulls all the records from Table A (""the messages"") along with a count of all the comments for each message from Table B.

The result would be:

**Hello - 0 comments<br>
Bonjour - 2 comments**

I know this is probably some combination of using a join with a count(*), but I can't seem to hit on just the right syntax. 

Any ideas?

Talking to some of the vendors, in order to evaluate whether their solutions support virtualization, it came out that, most of them, don't encourage or even support database virtualization, because of the I/O performance issues it might have.

More specifically I'm talking about a 80 Gb MSSQL database, which holds transaction tickets from the last 6 weeks and historic values of the last 2 years. The level of transactions per minute it's relatively high.

Still it's an older post, from '08, and since technology keeps improving, very much in the virtualization arena, I was wondering if there's more to it now, than a few years ago.

-----------------------------

the concept is.. 

You have a table (one that holds lots of records)..

    [data1] (call this the 'active' table)
    ---------
    Data1ID (required)
    SysID (required)
    createdDate (required)
    lastUpdatedDate (required)
    [mydata] (user's fields)

you also have n tables holding the same columns as Data1. 

    [data2] (call these the 'inactive' tables)
    ---------
    Data2ID (req.)
    SysID (req.)
    createdDate (req.)
    lastUpdatedDate (req.)
    [mydata] (user's fields)

...

    [data(n)]
    ---------
    Data(n)ID (req.)
    SysID (req.)
    createdDate (req.)
    lastUpdatedDate  (req.)
    [mydata] (user's fields)



When a user queries for a record, a **Trigger** is activated which 
initiates the search to happen on Data1 (the 'active' table).  
If a record isn't found, it checks the 'inactive' tables in 
order down the line.

If a record is found in a 'inactive' table,
the record is removed from that table and inserted into
Data1 (the 'active' table).

New records go into Data1.

There would never be redundant records across tables sharing the sysid.

**Daily Job**

- Each table is assigned a 'Term' date range: 

Data1: now - 3 months past.<br>
Data2: 3months - 6 months<br>
Data(n): anything previous to the last defined etc..

- Any Row modifications are applied to the 'inactive' tables based on the 'active' table.

- Any records with lastUpdatedDate in the 'active' table that fall within the 'Term' of the 'inactive' tables, are deleted from the 'active' table and moved to the appropriate 'inactive' table. Inactive tables are also checked in the same fasion.

Benefits
--------------------------------------------------------
My thinking is that this structure could easily be added to existing
bloated tables and make them more manageable as well as being a scalable
solution by simply redefining your 'Term' ranges and adding 'inactive' tables.


Issues..

Searches on inactive data will obviously take longer.

The problem is there are duplicates where records exist. When I match commission with the `records` table, it can result picking up these duplicates. Thus the rep gets paid more. On the other hand, there are duplicates in commission table also but those are valid beause they simple mean an account got paid for 2 months.

What happens is commission comes in one table, the records are another table. I match two based on certain critera (there is not exact match available). The problem is there are duplicates where records exist. When I match commission with the `records` table, it can result picking up these duplicates. Thus the rep gets paid more. On the other hand, there are duplicates in commission table also but those are valid beause they simple mean an account got paid for 2 months.

I wrote this query but it takes 5+ minutes to run. I have 50,000 records in records table and 100,000 in commission table. Is there any way I an improve this cursor?

The problem is the following: On a hosting provider when I publish the site it all works perfectly, but this site was needed to be hosted on the client server so I needed to do that. But the problem is that I also needed to configure the client server, because they don't have an Administrator employed (I know, I know ;) ). For the first time I some how managed, to set it up but a problem appear. My main web site is working just as it suppose to be - it reads (communicates with) the database, but My CMS is not. It shows the first log in page, but after that when I try to log in it throws the following error:

-setting time out on connection string to a higher value
-configuration and after that turning off server firewall
-checking the connection string over and over again (they are the same for all three projects and are saved in web.config)

**Important notes**: I have tried executing the project from VS2008 with a connection string to the same database and the results are the same. That's why I think the problem is the SQL Server 2005 and not the IIS7.

I have been banging my head with this one more the two weeks, and still don't know what the problem is ( I can't narrow it down). The problem is the following. I have a solution with 3 project in it all written in c# and I with LINQ. One project is the main web site, the other is the data layer (communication with the database) and the third one is a custom little CMS. The problem is the following: On a hosting provider when I publish the site it all works perfectly, but this site was needed to be hosted on the client server so I needed to do that. But the problem is that I also needed to configure the client server, because they don't have an Administrator employed (I know, I know ;) ). For the first time I some how managed, to set it up but a problem appear. My main web site is working just as it suppose to be - it reads (communicates with) the database, but My CMS is not. It shows the first log in page, but after that when I try to log in it throws the following error:

Ii want to be able to count the number of unique browser_agent strings, so I am performing the following query:

    select browser_agent, count(browser_agent) as 'count'
    from
    (
     select distinct guid, browser_agent
     from tblMyGlossary
     where browser_agent is not null
    )
    group by browser_agent
    order by 'count' desc;

Problem is SQL 2005 is complaining:

*Msg 156, Level 15, State 1, Line 8
Incorrect syntax near the keyword 'group'.*

Can anyone shed any light on how to resolve this please? I've run out of ideas.

Many thanks,

Today we lookup the prices manually. Here's a picture with explanations of the ""matrix"" that we use today: [Sample model][1] (sorry for the link - but I'm not allowed to post images because I've just opened my account.)


Now I need to transfer this model to a RDBMS system (SQL Server 2008 R2). The entry point when looking up a price is the Category, then the yearly interval and finally the interval depending on how many products we're selling on this order. The result of the quesry should be two prices.

Do you have any suggestions on how to model this? I was thinking of modeling it as a matrix with a `RowNumber`, `CellNumber` and a `CellValue`. But then I need another table for describing what is contained in each cell (by referencing the row and cell numbers). If doing that, I could just include the prices in that description table. But that doesn't seem like the best solution.

Do you have any hints/solutions on how to model this problem the best way?

Assume my table has these three fields `FIELD1, FIELD2, FIELD3`.  If I want to find the various scenarios in my data I could simply do this

    select distinct FIELD1, FIELD2, FIELD3 from <table>

And this works.  The problem is I have a plethora of other fields I need data from as well, but it doesn't matter what that data is as long as it's associated with the resulting record.  So for example if the above query returned this as one of the results

    FIELD1	FIELD2	FIELD3
    ----------------------
    Y		Blue	31

I would want to see the other content fields (4 through 10 lets say).  Now wether those came from record number #30 or record #20000 (assuming those records contained those 3 returned values) it doesn't matter as long as all the fields were returned by said record.

Hope that makes sense and someone can help!

The application is written in C# and runs in VS2010 against the 3.5 framework. I can't run the application on my machine to debug because it will not recognize the way they referenced their parameters when writing their DB queries. 

For instance wherever they have a SQL or DB2 query it is written like this: 

using (SqlCommand command = new SqlCommand(""SELECT Field1 FROM Table1 WHERE FieldID=@FieldID"", SQLconnection))
                {
                    command.Parameters.AddWithValue(""FieldID"", 10000);
                    SqlDataReader reader = command.ExecuteReader();
...

If you will notice the ""parameters.AddWithValue(""FieldID"", 10000);"" statement does not include the ""@"" symbol from the original command text. When I run it on my machine I get an error message stating that the parameter ""FieldID"" could not be found.

I change this line: 

                    command.Parameters.AddWithValue(""FieldID"", 10000);

To this:

Half the examples for SQL parameter addition are written including the ""@"" and the other half do not include it. Most likely I just don't know what to search for. 

Last choice is to change every query over to use the ""@"" at the front of the parameter name, but this is the transportation and operations application used to manage the corporation's shipments and literally has thousands of parameters. Hard to explain the ROI on your project when the answer to the director's question ""How's progress?"" happens to be ""I've been hard at it for a week and I've almost started.""

    FieldB (or better FieldC here?)
    FieldC (or better FieldB here?)
    FieldA

... or better two indices:

    FieldB
    FieldA

and

    FieldC
    FieldA

Or are there even other and better options? What's the best way and why?

Thank you for suggestions in advance!

I'll simplify the real scenario to make it easier to understand (and also to protect the client's data):

* Table A is the base table. It has a known identifier in it that I pass in to the query.
* For each entry in Table A there may be multiple entries in Table B. Table B contains a value that I am interested in.
* For each entry in Table B there may also be multiple entries in Table C. Table C contains another value I'm interested in.
* I also have an XML snippet containing a list of values that may or may not match up to some values in table C.
* The query does an outer join to the XML so that if there is a matching value it will return the value again, otherwise it is null.

What I want to do is get back the identifier I passed in, a count of the unique values in B and C, as well as a count of the non-null values from the XML part of the join.

My current query is:

    SELECT
        a.ID
      , COUNT(DISTINCT b.VAL) AS B_VAL
      , COUNT(DISTINCT c.VAL) AS C_VAL
      , COUNT(DISTINCT xml.VAL) AS XML_VAL
    FROM a, b, c,

          a.ID = b.SOME_ID
      AND b.OTHER_ID = c.OTHER_ID
      AND c.VAL = xml.VAL (+)

Now if you forget about the counting and just return rows, an example result set might look something like this:

    ID     B_VAL     C_VAL     XML_VAL
    ---------------------------------------
    X      abc       123       123

    X      abc       789       789

**DESIRED:** Now when I want to do the distinct counts, I'd like it to return:

    ID     B_VAL     C_VAL     XML_VAL
    ---------------------------------------
    X      1         3         2

    X      1         4         3

How come the DISTINCT seems to be operating only within a particular B_VAL, but taking it out causes it to operate across all the rows but not taking uniqueness into account?

Is there another way of doing this that doesn't involve having to replicate all the joins as a sub-query? Have I missed the point entirely?

Currently, the linq-sql translation is resulting in very unoptimised query results, so I am looking at ways to get LINQ to improve the SQL that it is producing.

The following is a typical scenario:

Firstly, the user interface controls are selected, resulting in a LINQ statement of:

`Company_contacts.Any(Cust_order_header.Any(Order_time >= @0))`

The table relations are as following : Companies 1-* Contacts 1-* Cust_order_header
The Cust_order_header contains the datetime field 'Order_time'.

Don't worry about @0 - that is a dynamic linq parameter that is passed in containing the datetime object.

The query translates to ""Give me all companies that have placed orders within the last (insert days based on datetime) days"".

 This results in a query that takes 5 minutes to complete, and kicks the hell out of the server.

The SQL it has created (which I have retrieved using `((ObjectQuery)groupQuery).ToTraceString())` is 


    SELECT *
    FROM [dbo].[Companies] AS [Extent1]
    WHERE  EXISTS (SELECT 
    	1 AS [C1]
    	FROM ( SELECT 
    		[Extent2].[Company_cont_key] AS [Company_cont_key]
    		FROM [dbo].[Company_contacts] AS [Extent2]
    		WHERE [Extent1].[Company_reference] = [Extent2].[Company_reference]
    	)  AS [Project1]
    	WHERE  EXISTS (SELECT 
    		1 AS [C1]
    		FROM [dbo].[Cust_order_header] AS [Extent3]
    		WHERE ([Project1].[Company_cont_key] = [Extent3].[Company_cont_key]) AND ([Extent3].[Order_time] >= convert(datetime, '2012-05-20 00:00:00.000', 121))
    	)
    )

Now, firstly - there are no joins in there, which leads me to think that the sql it is producing is significantly unoptimised.

AS, if I do to the following in SQL Management Studio manually:

    SELECT *

  [1]: http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2008/01/07/dynamic-linq-part-1-using-the-linq-dynamic-query-library.aspx",sql,performance,linq,,,07/25/2012 21:30:06,off topic,1,407,11,"LINQ Query performance - how to go about improving THIS query? I have written a module in my application that makes extensive use of Dynamic LINQ to produce linq/sql queries based on user interface selection.
Currently, the linq-sql translation is resulting in very unoptimised query results, so I am looking at ways to get LINQ to improve the SQL that it is producing.

The following is a typical scenario:

Firstly, the user interface controls are selected, resulting in a LINQ statement of:

`Company_contacts.Any(Cust_order_header.Any(Order_time >= @0))`

The table relations are as following : Companies 1-* Contacts 1-* Cust_order_header
The Cust_order_header contains the datetime field 'Order_time'.

Don't worry about @0 - that is a dynamic linq parameter that is passed in containing the datetime object.

The query translates to ""Give me all companies that have placed orders within the last (insert days based on datetime) days"".

 This results in a query that takes 5 minutes to complete, and kicks the hell out of the server.

The SQL it has created (which I have retrieved using `((ObjectQuery)groupQuery).ToTraceString())` is 


    SELECT *
    FROM [dbo].[Companies] AS [Extent1]
    WHERE  EXISTS (SELECT 
    	1 AS [C1]
    	FROM ( SELECT 
    		[Extent2].[Company_cont_key] AS [Company_cont_key]
    		FROM [dbo].[Company_contacts] AS [Extent2]
    		WHERE [Extent1].[Company_reference] = [Extent2].[Company_reference]
    	)  AS [Project1]
    	WHERE  EXISTS (SELECT 
    		1 AS [C1]
    		FROM [dbo].[Cust_order_header] AS [Extent3]
    		WHERE ([Project1].[Company_cont_key] = [Extent3].[Company_cont_key]) AND ([Extent3].[Order_time] >= convert(datetime, '2012-05-20 00:00:00.000', 121))
    	)
    )

Now, firstly - there are no joins in there, which leads me to think that the sql it is producing is significantly unoptimised.

AS, if I do to the following in SQL Management Studio manually:

    SELECT *
    FROM [dbo].[Companies] co
    join  [dbo].[Company_contacts] cc on co.Company_reference = cc.Company_reference
    join  [Cust_order_header] coh on coh.Company_cont_key = cc.Company_cont_key
    WHERE  [Order_time] >= convert(datetime, '2012-05-20 00:00:00.000', 121)

Then it's < 1s. 

So, I have spent 3 weeks putting together my Dynamic-LINQ based user controls/solution, getting rid of it isn't an option.

I have read http://www.pui.ch/phred/archives/2005/06/tagsystems-performance-tests.html which is MySQL based and it seems 2NF appears to be a good method for implementing this, however I was wondering if anyone had experience with doing this with SQL Server 2008 and very large datasets.

I am likely to initially have 1 million key fields which could have up to 50 keywords each.

Would a structure of

    keyfield, keyword1, keyword2, ... , keyword50

be the best solution or two tables

    keyid
    keyfield
    | 1
    |
    | M
    keyid
    keyword



Be a better idea if my queries are mostly going to be looking for results that have one or more keywords?

Thanks in advance",5
