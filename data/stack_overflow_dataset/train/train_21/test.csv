However, I have no idea how to access the properties of the `UITextPosition` objects that make up the `start` and `end` properties of `selectedTextRange`.

[Apple's docs on UITextPosition][2] are woeful at this time, providing no methods or properties, though I know there are such properties in the object, because NSLogging one gives this:

    <UITextPositionImpl: 0x6aaeb60>
    <<WebVisiblePosition: 0x6aa40e0>(offset=5, context=([s|a], [u+0073|u+0061])>

In this example, the 'offset' is correct, and the context shows the characters either side of the selection point ('s' and 'a'), but I don't know how to access this nebulous `WebVisiblePosition` class. So, in short, is there a way of retrieving the details I want using `UITextPosition` objects from `UITextField`?

However, I have no idea how to access the properties of the `UITextPosition` objects that make up the `start` and `end` properties of `selectedTextRange`.

[Apple's docs on UITextPosition][2] are woeful at this time, providing no methods or properties, though I know there are such properties in the object, because NSLogging one gives this:

    <UITextPositionImpl: 0x6aaeb60>
    <<WebVisiblePosition: 0x6aa40e0>(offset=5, context=([s|a], [u+0073|u+0061])>

In this example, the 'offset' is correct, and the context shows the characters either side of the selection point ('s' and 'a'), but I don't know how to access this nebulous `WebVisiblePosition` class. So, in short, is there a way of retrieving the details I want using `UITextPosition` objects from `UITextField`?

So if the person scrolls up, it would essentially zoom in in the space and objects that were further away will be closer to the reference point. If one zooms out, then those objects will fade into the back and whatever is behind the frame of refrence will come into view. Kind of like [this][1].

My problem is that if I move around the map for a while, only this is the only method that is called and it slows down considerably after only a dozen or so moves.

I originally had the maptile images load each time I moved and thought that this might be the problem, so have changed it, as you can see, to only load the pictures once and re-use them.  I tried using an imagecache from the book ""Beginning Iphone game development"" and emptying the cache at the start of each drawmap method.  I tried inplementing an autorelease pool and loading the tiles with the autorelease tag.  I tried deallocating the tiles as they were drawn, but as you would expect, this destroyed the image on the screen and therefore the map wasnt visible.

I am not lazy and have tried extensively to get this to stop slowing down, but unfortunately, it is beyond my coding skills at this time.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance.

        [self.view addSubview:a];
    }

And my MapTile looks like this -

    -(id)initWithFrame:(CGRect)frame :(NSInteger)pictureNumber
    {
        if (!dungeonLoaded)
        {
            UIImage *tempImage;
            for (NSInteger count=0;count<54;count++)
            {
                NSString *temp = [NSString alloc];
                temp = [NSString stringWithFormat:@""%i.png"", count];
                tempImage = [UIImage imageNamed:temp];
                loadedImage[count] = tempImage;
            }
            dungeonLoaded = YES;
        }
        CGRect rect = CGRectMake(frame.origin.x,frame.origin.y,
                                 loadedImage[pictureNumber].size.width,
                                 loadedImage[pictureNumber].size.height);
        self = [super initWithFrame:rect];
        image = [loadedImage[pictureNumber] retain];
        self.opaque = NO;
        self.backgroundColor = [UIColor clearColor];
        return self;
    }

My problem is that if I move around the map for a while, only this is the only method that is called and it slows down considerably after only a dozen or so moves.

I originally had the maptile images load each time I moved and thought that this might be the problem, so have changed it, as you can see, to only load the pictures once and re-use them.  I tried using an imagecache from the book ""Beginning Iphone game development"" and emptying the cache at the start of each drawmap method.  I tried inplementing an autorelease pool and loading the tiles with the autorelease tag.  I tried deallocating the tiles as they were drawn, but as you would expect, this destroyed the image on the screen and therefore the map wasnt visible.

I am not lazy and have tried extensively to get this to stop slowing down, but unfortunately, it is beyond my coding skills at this time.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance.

    			[DocOwner addObject:[xmlElement stringValue]];


but I ran into a problem, in cases where I have the following:

    <Discover id=""1234"">SomeValue</Discover>

using the previous method will return `SomeValue` but no the `id=1234`. How can I parse that part? 

This is done on XCode 4 for Mac OS X.  
Thank you

    = [[settingsViewController alloc] initWithNibName:@""settingsViewController"" bundle:nil];
	
	
	controller.modalTransitionStyle = UIModalTransitionStyleFlipHorizontal;
	[self presentModalViewController:controller animated:YES];
	
	[controller release];

Upon returning to the view with the navigation controller (the home screen) the nav controller bar is not there, and none of the buttons which usually switch views using the nav controller work.

Is there some way I need to re-initialize the navigation controller when I return to the nav controller view after switching to a view without a nav controller?",5

",objective-c,ios,ios5,iphone-sdk-4.0,,,open,0,227,9,"Separate Full Sentences in a block of NSString text I have been trying to use Regular Expression to separate full sentences in a big block of text. I can't use the componentsSeparatedByCharactersInSet because it will obviously fail with sentences ending in ?!, !!, ... I have seen some external classes to do componentSeparateByRegEx but I prefer doing it without adding an external library. 

Here is a sample input 
**Hi, I am testing. How are you? Wow!! this is the best, and I am happy.** 

The output should be an array

I have a UITableViewCell that only contains a UISwitch, centered in the cell. The cell is in a UITableView with the Grouped style. 

On the iPhone, I merely set the center property of the switch to the center of the cell in `tableView:cellForRowAtIndexPath:`. That suffices for the iPhone because the center of the cell is the same regardless of table style. Here's the code for the iPhone:

        cell = [[[UITableViewCell alloc] initWithStyle:UITableViewCellStyleDefault reuseIdentifier:CellIdentifier] autorelease];
        UISwitch *view = [[UISwitch alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectZero];

        cell.selectionStyle = UITableViewCellSelectionStyleNone;
        [cell.contentView addSubview:view];
        [view release];

On the iPad, without changing any code, the position of the switch is still in the center of an iPhone screen. That's bad, since iPad is way bigger than iPhone. So I moved the positioning code to `tableView:willDisplayCell:forRowAtIndexPath:` and now it's on the other side of center (closer to the right side of the screen). 

    -(void)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView willDisplayCell:(UITableViewCell *)cell forRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath {
    UISwitch *s = (UISwitch *)[cell.contentView viewWithTag:SwitchTag];
    s.center = cell.center //pushes the switch too far to the right
}

And yet, when I log the various coordinates and frames that I'm interested in, I get what I expect: the x coordinate of the center of the cell is at 384.0 which is half the screen width. I've also tried recalculating the whole frame of the UISwitch, but since I'm using the values of the screen, the switch ends up in the same spot, too far to the right.

What I _think_ is going on is that there is some transform after `tableView:willDisplayCell:forRowAtIndexPath:` is called (or before, even) to render all those numbers meaningless. It almost looks as if the whole cell gets shifted by _x_, where _x_ is the distance from the edge of the screen to the start of the cell, even though that's  not reported in the `frame` property.

    @interface PointerFun : NSObject {
    	NSString* test;
    }

I have no @property compiler directive, no @synthesize, so no getter and no setter. Just for testing.

Then I have a method, where I try around some things with pointers and this instance variable. What I actually wanted to check out is what would happen when I assign that instance variable an NSString object (or whatever object), and after assigning the object, assign another object to that pointer which I assigned to the instance var. I thought that it would change the object in the instance var as weell.

So here's my code:

    NSString *str1 = [NSString stringWithCString:""one""];
    NSString *str2 = [NSString stringWithCString:""two""];
    	
    test = str2; // assign directly to instance variable (bad thing, just for testing!)
    str2 = str1; // now lets be really mean and change the object from that pointer!!
    	
    NSLog(@""test: %x, %@"", test, test); // test: 52cb10, two
    NSLog(@""str1: %x, %@"", str1, str1); // str1: 52ca60, one 
    NSLog(@""str2: %x, %@"", str2, str2); // str2: 52ca60, one

Like you see, the instance variable keeps pointing to the NSString object that was early behind str2. So when I assigned str1 to str2, I assigned the value of str1 to str2, which is a memory address. So I made both pointers have the same value, right? 

But when I assigned the value of str2 to test, test took over the value from str2, which was -at that time- the memory address for the ""two"" object. So even if I change after that assignment the value of the pointer str2, it will not affect the instance variable's value. And because that is an pointer to an NSString object, it just behaves the same as if it was str1 or str2. There is no difference just because it's an instance var. It's just an variable, or better: it's just an pointer. Did I get that right? phew ;) ...hope so!",objective-c,pointers,c,c++,,,open,0,372,13,"Why does my instance variable behave so strange?

In .Net, my data-driven architecture and development process looked like this:

* Create a set of .Net classes.

* Create an empty database with a database schema - generally with a table for each class.

* Create a .Net database interface layer to coordinate the .Net objects and the database.

* Create a .Net front end.  Configure each control of the class to render and/or alter some data stored in an object.

Here's my understanding of a comparable Cocoa/Core Data solution:

* Create an Xcode Cocoa project using Core Data.  The template comes with an AppDelegate class, which is a model controller for the data, and which includes a generic Core Data stack (including a context, a persistent store coordinator, and a managed object model).

* Use the Xcode Data Modeler to create a set of classes and relationships.

* Extend the AppDelegate class to attach the Core Data stack to a persistent store, to issue requests for particular sets of managed objects (fetching them into the context for key/value coding and observation), and to save the object set back to persistent storage.

* Create a Cocoa front end. For each control that should present some data, create a view controller to manage the data in the control. Attach the view controller to the AppDelegate (as a model controller of the managed objects stored in the context).  This attachment can be done via event-driven code, or by specifying bindings within the inspectors for the Cocoa controls.

Do I have that right?

Also, some questions:

1) I'm having trouble figuring out where to put the code extending the AppDelegate. That class already includes a *ton* of auto-generated code, and I don't really want to inject my code into the same module.

I've read some different recommendations about this point - whether to put it in a different class (maybe a singleton) and tie it somehow to the AppDelegate; whether to put it into a separate category of the AppDelegate class (improved readability, but optional categories can't have instance variables); or whether to put it in right into the AppDelegate module. Thoughts?

2) One simple aspect that most Core Data texts and samples overlook is how to create a new persistent data store (e.g., a new SQLite database) based on the objects created in the Xcode Data Modeler. The samples simply seem to presume that it exists. Is there a way to create a new database programmatically? Or do I have to create it separately by hand?

3) Any suggestions for choosing between ad-hoc imperative code and data bindings for the front-end/data-model interchange? On .Net, data binding is available but limited and unreliable, so I got into the habit of writing imperative code; but *every* Core Data tutorial I've read relies on bindings.

I have 6 views that extends UIView, these views all have different behavior but share certain methods, like ""-(void)update"" and ""-(void) changeState:(NSInteger) state"".

A viewController, who's job is it to update, instantiate and display these views has a switch block to do this. So switch(4) {...} instantiates UIView4, but as I need a reference to the currently instantiated view(to do update and changeState...), I have a UIView property on my ViewController called self.currentView. As the instantiated UIView4 extends UIView I can easily go [self.currentView addSubview:UIView4instance] and then release the UIView4instance.

Now how will I call the [UIView4instance update] method on the view? or the [UIView5instance changeState] etc. etc.
Since I added it to self.currentView which is of type UIView it no longer has any reason to believe it has an ""update"" or ""changeState"" method. Meaning I can not iterate the views and send them these messages.

This approach brings on a ton of other problems, I would need to test and typeCast my views each time I needed to do any operations on them. 

If I were doing something like this Composite Pattern approach in, say, Java. I would either write an interface that all the views (UIView1, UIview2.... UIViewN) would implement. 
Or maybe an Abstract class that all the views inherited the changeState and update methods from.

This way I could have self.currentView just know that Im adding objects to your view and they all conform to these methods.

The two solutions I can think of, with my very small Objective C experience is:
doing it with delegation or categories, but this seems overkill in every way :/
I guess I could also extend UIView and then extend my class extending UIView again, but there is probably a reason Objective C does not directly support Abstract classes...

Hope someone could point me in the right direction regarding these issues.

Because of this I use two NSManagedObjectContexts (MOC), a child and a parent, and these must always be in sync. To make sure they are in sync I always edit/add data to the child MOC so it gets pushed to the main MOC with the following pattern:

    [childMOC performBlock:^{
	
	    MyObject *myObject = *create new object in childMOC*

I've seen the pattern above been used a lot, but it seems strange that no one mentioned this temporary/permanent ID problem.

1. It doesn't feel right that it can be two versions of the same object within a context. If I pass an NSManagedObjectID to the child MOC and retrieve that, shouldn't the child MOC update my existing object instead of creating a new one and leave my old temporary as cached default?

I'm well-aware that Objective-C is a verbose language; I'm just wondering if it has to be as verbose as it is in the solution I'm showing below. I'm relatively new to the language.

This piece of code counts the number of each type of field in a record, pursuant to generating a  variable-height UITableViewCell containing one label per field. My question isn't about how to do this -- I've already figured that out -- I'm just wondering: isn't there a simpler or less verbose way of doing this in Objective-C, using an NSDictionary object? Is this as terse as it gets using an NSDictionary? Solutions using other collection-type objects are also welcome.

I am very new to Cocoa and ObjectiveC programming (not to mention Mac stuff) and I am developing an iPad application.

I would like to get keyboard codes from the standard on-screen keyboard but without using any (at least visible) control like Text Field. Also, I would like to get the key codes as soon you press it, detecting both the key down and up events.

Any hints on how that is doable?

The application relies on Core Data, which I've gathered is mostly thread unsafe.  I have a different NSManagedObjectContext for each search/parse operation (and one for the controller), and only pass the NSManagedObjectId between operations or proxy objects.

The operations communicate the completed parse results back to their controller via an NSConnection object.  The controller constructs the NSConnection using an NSMachPort object, sets itself as the root object, and gives the same NSConnection object to each of the targets of the NSInvocationOperations.  The controller then enqueues the NSInvocationOperation for execution in its own NSOperationQueue.

In the search threader object I have the following method:

    -(void) executeSearchAndParse
    { 
     id parentServer = [threadConnection rootProxy];
     [parentServer setProtocolForProxy:@protocol(SearchParseProtocol)];
 
     NSArray *importResults = [targetSchema generatedDataSetIds];
 
     [parentServer schemaFinished:targetSchema];
     [parentServer addSearchResults:importResults];
    }

I believe I have followed the Apple example of generic inter-thread communication given [here](http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/DistrObjects/DistrObjects.html).

I have to say that most of the time, this works beautifully: The notifications from the NSConnection rootProxy are posted to the run loop in the main thread as expected and wait for pickup until the controller object is ready.  However, in some of my test cases it causes Core Data to grind to a screeching halt because sometimes the messages make it to the controller object *in the same thread as the NSInvocationOperation object which is calling the rootProxy object*.  

I've placed a debugger point in the controller on the message which is sent when the search/parse operation is complete, and sure enough, sometimes (just sometimes) the executing thread is *not* the main one.  Does anyone have an idea as to why this might occur?  Or, is there a simpler way to construct inter-thread asynchronous communication?  OR is my approach for Core Data totally off-kilter?

I'm writing an Objective-C wrapper to a C library. My goals are:

1)  The wrapper use Objective-C objects.  For example, if the C API defines a parameter such as char *name, the Objective-C API should use name:(NSString *).

2)  The client using the Objective-C wrapper should not have to have knowledge of the inner-workings of the C library.

Speed is not really any issue.

That's all easy with simple parameters.  It's certainly no problem to take in an NSString and convert it to a C string to pass it to the C library.

My indecision comes in when complex structures are involved.  

Let's say you have:

    struct flow
    {
        long direction;
        long speed;
        long disruption;
        long start;
        long stop;
    } flow_t;
    
    And then your C API call is:
    
    void setFlows(flow_t inFlows[4]);

So, some of the choices are:  
1) expose the flow_t structure to the client and have the Objective-C API take an array of those structures  
2) build an NSArray of four NSDictionaries containing the properties and pass that as a parameter  
3) create an NSArray of four ""Flow"" objects containing the structure's properties and pass that as a parameter  


My analysis of the approaches:<br>
Approach 1:  Easiest.  However, it doesn't meet the design goals  
Approach 2:  For some reason, this seems to me to be the most ""Objective-C"" way of doing it.  However, each element of the NSDictionary would have to be wrapped in an NSNumber.  Now it seems like we're doing an awful lot just to pass the equivalent of a struct.  
Approach 3:  Seems the cleanest to me from an object-oriented standpoint and the extra encapsulation could come in handy later.  However, like #2, it now seems like we're doing an awful lot (creating an array, creating and initializing objects) just to pass a struct.
