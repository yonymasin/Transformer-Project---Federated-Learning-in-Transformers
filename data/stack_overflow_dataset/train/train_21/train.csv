This is my first attempt to play with blocks in Objective C. It feels a little weird, but it seems to work well. I have a couple of questions about it, though:

1. Does this seem like a sane way to implement such a method?
2. Is there some way to implement its internals using `-enumerateMatchesInString:options:range:usingBlock:
`? I tried it, but could not assign to `pos` from within the block. But if there was a way to make it work, it'd be cool to also pass the NSMatchingFlags and BOOL and handle them in the same way as that method. Do-able?
",objective-c,blocks,objective-c-category,,,,open,0,487,7,"Is this a sane Objective-C Block Implementation? I wanted a variation of NSRegularExpression's `– stringByReplacingMatchesInString:options:range:withTemplate:` method that takes a block instead of a template. The return value of the block would be used as the replacement value. This is more flexible than a template, as you can imagine. Sort of like using the `/e` modifier in Perl regular expressions.

So I wrote a category to add the method. This is what I came up with:

    @implementation NSRegularExpression (Block)

                                        usingBlock:(NSString* (^)(NSTextCheckingResult *result))block
    {
        NSMutableString *ret = [NSMutableString string];
        NSUInteger pos = 0;

        for (NSTextCheckingResult *res in [self matchesInString:string options:options range:range]) {
            if (res.range.location > pos) {
                [ret appendString:[string substringWithRange:NSMakeRange(pos, res.range.location - pos)]];

            pos = res.range.location + res.range.length;

I feel like the answer is staring me in the face and I just need another set of eyes. 

I'm using AFNetworking to connect to the Stripe.com API. Specifically I'm using AFHTTPClient postPath to send data to an endpoint, charges. Stripe requires the request to be encoded as application/x-www-form-urlencoded so I can't use JSON encoding.

The problem I'm running into is that I have a Charge object and a Card object. Card is a property on Charge and I convert both Charge and Card to NSDictionary's (Card is an dictionary inside of the Charge dictionary) and then pass them in as the parameters on the request like so:

    NSDictionary *parameters = [ChargeRequest convertToDictionary:request];

        NSLog(@""Error: %@"", [error localizedDescription]);
        NSLog(@""Response: %@"", operation.responseString);
    }];

so I think there must be something wrong in NSKeyedArchiver and NSKeyedArchiver.I don't know why the variable magicNumber losing.I mean it is 0.But it does not lose the float type of variable.I'm confused what is wrong with my programming.Thanks for helping.And I implied successfully.

   I'm trying to copy an item from one UITableView to another UITableView and information I've seen on the web regarding how to do this has been sketchy at best. I figured it out on my own and so I'll describe my little architecture.

- Master UIView
   - UIView with UITableView
       - Custom UITableViewCell
          - Custom UIView that gets copied (Person object in my case)
   - UIView with UITableView
       - Custom UITableViewCell
          - Custom UIView that gets copied (Person object in my case)

   The person object that I have in the UITableView is the object that I want to drag and drop out of one table and into another. I had the most difficult figuring out how to pop the item out of the table and drag it over in a single smooth motion. For the longest time, it would take me two touches in order to perform the operation.

   Starting with the Person object, this is a simple object that contains an image. I had to implement my own touchesMoved method to change the center position of the Person when a drag is taking place.

        -(void) touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event{
         	if( m_moveable == YES ){
    		UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject];
    		CGPoint location = [touch locationInView:self.superview];
	
    		if( 0 < location.x-50 && location.x+50 < 768 ){ 
    			if( 0 < location.y-50 && location.y+150 < 1004 ){
    				self.center = location;
    			}
    		}
    	}
    }

   I set the Person object's userInteractionEnabled flag to NO on initialization so that any clicks in the table would not get caught by the Person object. The Person object in that case would move within the table which defeats the purpose.

   The next object is my custom UITableViewCell. This object is responsible to catch the user's first touch. What it's supposed to do is catch this touch and ""pop"" the Person out. The Person is one of the subviews belonging to the custom UITableViewCell. 

        -(void) touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event
        {
    	UIView *parent = self.superview.superview.superview;	
    	
    	Person *s = nil;
     	for( UIView *child in self.subviews ){
     		if( [child isKindOfClass:[Person class]] ){
     			s = child;
        		s removeFromSuperview];
     			break;
     		}		
     	}
	
     	if( s != nil ){
     		self.userInteractionEnabled = NO;
     		s.userInteractionEnabled = YES;
     		[parent addSubview:s];
     		[self touchesEnded:touches withEvent:event];
     	}
     }

   It's important to note the userInteractionEnabled flag getting flipped in the above method. Before the touch, the Person object is ""off limits"" to a person's touch. After the custom cell catches a move, the Person is released by adding it to the parent's view and then activated (userInteractionEnabled=YES). The Person object is then ""born"" and can handle move touches on it's own. 

   This has one minor glitch in that the Person object blinks in the upper left corner but then drops down immediately to the user's finger. 

   The final part of this design is that the master UIView needs to handle a ""touch transition."" When the user is touching the table and the Person object gets popped out, the app needs to realize that focus needs to be removed from the table and directed towards the Person object. The way that this was done is that the hitTest method in the master UIView was overloaded with the following.



    
    -(UIView*) hitTest:(CGPoint)point withEvent:(UIEvent *)event
    {

    	UIView *rv = nil;
    	for(UIView *child in self.subviews){
    		if( [child isKindOfClass:[Person class]] ){
    			rv = child;
    			child.center = point;
    			break;
    		}
    	}
    	
    	if( rv == nil ){
    		rv = [super hitTest:point withEvent:event];
    	}
    	
    	return rv;
    }    

   The way that this code works, is that when the Person is popped out of the table, it doesn't have a touch focused at it. The touch is ""owned"" by the UITableView from which the Person was popped out of. The hitTest method is the key to refocusing that touch. Regularly, the system checks to see which UIView is the focus of a touch. The hitTest method is called by the system to identify that UIView. When the Person is attached to the master view, this hitTest function iterates through all subviews and detects the presence of the Person and returns it as the ""dominant"" touched object. Any movement of your finger will immediately be reported to the Person and not to the UITableView.

   This is guts of the implementation. To have a UITableView ""catch"" the moving object is simple now and I'll leave it for you to try!

I have a Radius tool that when a selection is made, the annotations should add/remove based on distance around the user. 

I have it add/removing fine but for some reason the annotations won't show up until I zoom in or out. 

This is the method that adds/removes the annotations based on distance. I have tried two different variations of the method. 

1. Adds the new annotations to an array, then adds to the map by `[mapView addAnnotations:NSArray]`.

2. Add the annotations as it finds them using `[mapView addAnnotation:MKMapAnnotation]`;

Maybe I've got all memory managment thing wrong. In my code I've got  UIViewController object which have ivar TelephoneValidator *validator

    ...
         validatorOptions     = [fieldData objectForKey:@""fieldValidator""];

    if (![validatorOptions respondsToSelector:@selector(isEqualToString:)]) {

Basicly if my validatorOptions isn't NSString the validator ivar became TelephoneValidator instance.

I've checked a couple of times if dealloc works, and it is. After calling dealloc the validator is released (calling any method on validator after [validator release] gets me exception).

 

And yet in Instruments it is telling me that TelephoneValidator is leaked. And after double clicking in Instruments the line of code that is highlited is:

    validator = [[TelephoneValidator alloc] initWithOptions: validatorOptions];

This allows problems with a method to be caught early and their sources traced easily.  

In my Mac application, I accomplished this by creating an `Assert` class.  This class has several class methods.  These methods determine if some precondition is met, and if it is not, then an exception is thrown.  A typical assertion might looks something like this:

    -(void) setWidth: (int) theWidth {
        [Assert integer: width isGreaterThanInteger: 0];
        width = theWidth;
    }

This works really well, and significantly reduced the amount of time I've spend bug hunting.  However, I've noticed lately some of the assertion methods are very useful as predicates.  For example, my `integer:isGreaterThanInteger:andLessThanInteger:` and my `stringIsNotEmpty:` methods are equally useful.  To this end, I created a second class `Predicate`, which I filled with several of my more useful predicate methods.  So I took the logic from the assert methods, and moved it into `Predicate`, and then rewrote my `Assert` methods like the following:

    if ![Predicate predicateMethod]
        throw exception

This has turned into a maintenance nightmare.  If I change the name of a method name in `Predicate`, I must also change it in `Assert` to stay consistent.  If I update the documentation of an `Assert` method, then I must do the same to a `Predicate` method.

Ideally, I would like the reconstruct the `Assert` class so that when any method is called on it, it intercepts the selector.  The `Predicate` class can then be checked to see if it responds to the selector, and if it does, the method is called on `Predicate`with the same arguments that were passed into the `Assert` method.  If the `Predicate` method returns false, then an exception is thrown.

Is there a way to do this in Objective-C?

Thanks.

2. When the container view is loaded, I draw all of these views out in a loop. 

3. All of the views are drawn into a UIScrollView.

I am trying to determine the best/optimal way to layout all of the views when the device is switched from Portrait to Landscape. 

**The ways that I have thought to handle this is as follows:**

1. When the device is switched, completely wipe the view and reload everything. 
2. As the views are loaded, add them to an holding array. When the device is rotated, cycle through the array and change the frames of each view. 
3. In each view, have two properties. A property that holds their frame for portrait and landscape. When the device is rotated call reloadInputViews/ViewNeedsLayout/setNeedsLayout.

I would like to know if it's possible to determinate which strings in the array list aren't defined as instance in the object MyObject.    
=> myInstance3 and myInstance4 for this case.


I tried to use ""isKindOfClass"", ""isMemberOfClass"", ""valueForKeyPath"", ""valueForKey"" but without success... Let me know if you have some advices to resolve my problem :)

It sounds like a really nice project, but my previous iOS projects have been of a more 'static' kind, drawing views, scrolling, zooming, tables, etc. and I'm having trouble coming up with how to do this new app.

I have made the transition to Objective-C from Flash, and many of the concepts in Flash have proven to have iOS equivalents, which made the transition pretty smooth sofar. With the task of creating many hand-animated scenes accompanied by interactive animations however, I can't figure out what the right workflow would look like for iOS. In Flash this is a breeze due to the integrated timeline/keyframe animation tools. 

Of course I know there are lots of options to look into, but I'm not confident about the techniques I can come up with myself:

 1. **Fully scripted animation** - this is fine for simple object-level animations, but if you need the finesse of a hand animated scene, writing everything in code is insane.
 2. **Quicktime movies** - a movie can be the result of any animation environment (Flash, After Effects, 3D rendering, etc) so your animation can be anything. Though that's nice, the down sides are a huge increase in file size, great limitations to interactivity and if you combine multiple movies, a very negative impact on performance.
 3. **Texture atlases** - ([see this article][1]) though a great technique to use for flexible animations, I assume using this on iOS will restrict you to use a very small set of frames limiting the complexity of the animations, or very small animations, limiting the visual size of the characters.

Who knows what workflows teams use to create the animations in apps/games like Happy Tree Friends: Slap Happy ([Video, don't mind the commentary][2]) or the alien/frog in Cut the Rope ([iTunes][3])? Are there any tools or libraries that speed going back and forth between XCode and possible third party software? And a final blasphemic question: are there any tools to import animation sequences from Adobe's Flash as Cocoa objects that you can then code with? (note: [it has been done in JS][4])

If I use a library with static linking,
is that mean I copy the code i need from library for my program and link with them?
Then my program can work with the code from library.

If i use a library with dynamic linking,
is that mean I only reference the code i need from library to my program when my program is running.

In this book, there is a section in where you are instructed to make a 'Rock, Paper, Scissors' game using a variety of UIViewControllers. My problem is that I cannot create an IBOutlet from the ViewController_iphone.xib (which, as the name suggests, is made for the iPhone) to the ViewController.h file that comes with every new project. 

In ViewController_iPhone.xib I have created a UIView and set the file's owner of the .xib to ViewController_iPhone.xib. When i ctrl+click and try to link the view to ViewController.h, it simply does not give me the option to do so. When I change the file's owner to ViewController, it is not a problem to create IBOutlets in ViewController.h, however that is not the correct file's owner that will allow the program to work correctly. 

I have downloaded the source code for the book, and the author of the book seemed to have no problems whatsoever creating the oultlets. I have compared my project to his and I can't seem to find what is wrong.

If anybody could help me, I would be very grateful.
Thanks!

I had figured it to be when the scope of the method the object was allocated within ended, but my tests aren't indicating that.  I have code like the following:

    int itemIndex = 0;
    NSArray* items = [mResponse componentsSeparatedByString:@"",""];	
    self.mText = (NSString*)[items objectAtIndex:itemIndex++];
    self.mText = [mText gtm_stringByUnescapingFromURLArgument];
    NSLog(@""retain count: %d"",[mText retainCount]);

This returns 2 for the count (mText has a retain property so that makes sense), and after exiting this method, the call from outside likewise returns 2.

In other language like Actionscript I can intercept the size of my view and divide it for 2 to center an Item.

someone can help me please?

I use a php script from this tutorial (http://www.raywenderlich.com/3525/apple-push-notification-services-tutorial-part-2).

Basically, the script is put in an infintive loop, that check a mysql table for new records every couple of seconds. The tutorial says it should be run as a background process. 

    // This script should be run as a background process on the server. It checks
    // every few seconds for new messages in the database table push_queue and 
    // sends them to the Apple Push Notification Service.
    //
    // Usage: php push.php development &

So I have four questions. 

1. How do I start the script from the terminal? What should I type? The script location on the server is:

    /var/www/development_folder/scripts/push2/push.php 



2. How can I kill it if I need to (without having to restart apace)?

3. Since the push notification is essential, I need a way to check if the script is running.
The code (from the tutorial) calls a function is something goes wrong: 

        function fatalError($message)
        {
	     writeToLog('Exiting with fatal error: ' . $message);
	     exit;
        }

Maybe I can put something in there to restart the script? But It would also be nice to have a cron job or something that check every 5 minute or so if the script is running, and start it if it doens't. 


4  - Can I make the script automatically start after a apace or mysql restart? If the server crash or something else happens that need a apace restart?

The AppDelegate is using several NSOperation subclasses that are used in a method called syncDatabase. This method gets executed in only two locations, an onSyncButtonPressed method and an onSyncTimeFired method. The onSyncButtonPressed method only gets executed when the user taps a specific button. The onSyncTimeFired method gets executed when the application first launches and every five minutes after that. If the app is in the background when the five minute mark hits, the app will then sync, syncDatabase being executed, immediately once it comes back from the background. Of course, in order to sync an active internet connection is required. If there is no connection, then the application silently fails and the sync is attempted at the next five minute interval. As best as I can tell, this piece works correctly. When the app is in the background and comes back to the foreground the syncDatabase method is called. Inside this syncDatabase method, I build up a variety of different NSOperation subclasses. Some have dependencies on others and what not. I know that those operations are occurring in the order that is needed. Each NSOperation subclass creates an instance of our WebServices class and passes it self, the NSOperation subclass, to the web service as a delegate. The web service builds up a connection, and when the connection did finish loading, it calls its delegate to process the results. This method will add an operation with a block on the main queue from the NSOperationQueue class, when its done processing the results, to post a notification using NSNotificationCenter.

There is a method called SyncInProgress that returns a bool if syncing is occurring or not. It runs on the main thread, and when my operations start they call startServiceCall which will call incrementActiveServiceCounter on the app delegate.

    @implmentation SyncronizationOperation

    - (void) startServiceCall
    {
        NSOperationQueue *mainQueue = [NSOperationQueue mainQueue];
        [mainQueue addOperationWithBlock:^(void) {
            AppDelegate *appDelegate = (AppDelegate *)[[UIApplication sharedApplication] delegate];
            [appDelegate incrementActiveServiceCounter];
        }];
    }

    - (void) endServiceCall
    {
        NSOperationQueue *mainQueue = [NSOperationQueue mainQueue];
        [mainQueue addOperationWithBlock:^(void) {
            AppDelegate *appDelegate = (AppDelegate *)[[UIApplication sharedApplication] delegate];
            [appDelegate decrementActiveServiceCounter];
        }];
    }

    @end

All our NSOperation subclasses inherit from this class and when start method in those operations are started, the startServiceCall will be called in the start method.

    @implementation GetTableOperation

    - (void) start
    {
        ... other code
        [self startServiceCall];
        ... other code
    }

    - (void) processServiceResults:(XMLReader *)results forOperation:(NSString *)operation
    {
        // update table with the returned information

        [[NSOperationQueue mainQueue] addOperationWithBlock:^{
            NSMutableDictionary *userDict = [[[NSMutableDictionary alloc] initWithCapacity:2] autorelease];
            [userDict setObject:_tableName forKey:@""Table""];
            [userDict setObject:theValue forKey:@""Completed""];

            [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] postNotificationName:SYNCTABLEUPDATED object:_appDelegate userInfo:userDict];
        }];

        [self endServiceCall];
        [self finish];

There are 2 things that I am curious about.

1. Sometimes during a sync, the app doesn't recoginze a sync is happening and thus the incorrect state is shown.
2. Sometimes, NSOperation subclass locks when accessing the main thread when calling that NSOperationQueue mainQueue guy. Sometimes, one only has to wait for a minute, other times for much longer.

Any one have any ideas?

",objective-c,ios,nsoperation,nsoperationqueue,,,open,0,1694,15,"ViewController when viewWillAppear called does not always correctly reflect state of syncing with web service There is a bug in our iPad application that I am looking into that consists of when the view controller method viewWillAppear is called it does not always correctly reflect the state of syncing with our web service. The AppDelegate is using several NSOperation subclasses that are used in a method called syncDatabase. This method gets executed in only two locations, an onSyncButtonPressed method and an onSyncTimeFired method. The onSyncButtonPressed method only gets executed when the user taps a specific button. The onSyncTimeFired method gets executed when the application first launches and every five minutes after that. If the app is in the background when the five minute mark hits, the app will then sync, syncDatabase being executed, immediately once it comes back from the background. Of course, in order to sync an active internet connection is required. If there is no connection, then the application silently fails and the sync is attempted at the next five minute interval. As best as I can tell, this piece works correctly. When the app is in the background and comes back to the foreground the syncDatabase method is called. Inside this syncDatabase method, I build up a variety of different NSOperation subclasses. Some have dependencies on others and what not. I know that those operations are occurring in the order that is needed. Each NSOperation subclass creates an instance of our WebServices class and passes it self, the NSOperation subclass, to the web service as a delegate. The web service builds up a connection, and when the connection did finish loading, it calls its delegate to process the results. This method will add an operation with a block on the main queue from the NSOperationQueue class, when its done processing the results, to post a notification using NSNotificationCenter.

There is a method called SyncInProgress that returns a bool if syncing is occurring or not. It runs on the main thread, and when my operations start they call startServiceCall which will call incrementActiveServiceCounter on the app delegate.

    @implmentation SyncronizationOperation

    - (void) startServiceCall
    {
        NSOperationQueue *mainQueue = [NSOperationQueue mainQueue];
        [mainQueue addOperationWithBlock:^(void) {
            AppDelegate *appDelegate = (AppDelegate *)[[UIApplication sharedApplication] delegate];
            [appDelegate incrementActiveServiceCounter];
        }];
    }

    - (void) endServiceCall
    {
        NSOperationQueue *mainQueue = [NSOperationQueue mainQueue];
        [mainQueue addOperationWithBlock:^(void) {
            AppDelegate *appDelegate = (AppDelegate *)[[UIApplication sharedApplication] delegate];
            [appDelegate decrementActiveServiceCounter];
        }];
    }

    @end

All our NSOperation subclasses inherit from this class and when start method in those operations are started, the startServiceCall will be called in the start method.

    @implementation GetTableOperation

    - (void) start
    {
        ... other code
        [self startServiceCall];
        ... other code
    }

            [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] postNotificationName:SYNCTABLEUPDATED object:_appDelegate userInfo:userDict];

I think it's great so far for wrapping my head around different concepts. Unfortunately, I don't really see any uses in applications I have in mind for iOS and Mac. 

I'm going to continue to complete the problems (as I'm able) because I think it's great brain exercise. I've searched but haven't found any sites where there are problems that are more programming related and less math centric. 

So far my learning has gone like this:

1. I want to do __________ in my program.
2. Read book about _________
3. Experiment a bit
4. Watch videos about _________ (I watch the WWDCs and videos like Dr. Larson's Advanced iPhone course)
5. Try to implement new knowledge.

I know both reading related and more general theory books like *'The Pragmatic Programmer'* (started a few days ago - as recommended in stackoverflow question 1711) is going to continue to help me become a better programmer and having stackoverflow is great with the quality of questions and answers provided. 

Do you use any other Project Euler-esq sites that are Mac Centric (or at least object oriented) with less math( i.e complete task move on to harder related task)? If not is there another resouce that I'm missing that I should be using to help become better. 


I know there are related questions for other programming languages. But I wanted to ask specifically for iOS and Mac development.

",objective-c,ios,cocoa,,,12/15/2011 22:43:33,off topic,1,294,7,"Becoming a better iOS and MacOSX Programmer I've started using [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/) to improve my objective-c coding and have worked through some of the problems. I think it's great so far for wrapping my head around different concepts. Unfortunately, I don't really see any uses in applications I have in mind for iOS and Mac. 

I'm going to continue to complete the problems (as I'm able) because I think it's great brain exercise. I've searched but haven't found any sites where there are problems that are more programming related and less math centric. 

So far my learning has gone like this:

1. I want to do __________ in my program.
2. Read book about _________
3. Experiment a bit
4. Watch videos about _________ (I watch the WWDCs and videos like Dr. Larson's Advanced iPhone course)
5. Try to implement new knowledge.

I know both reading related and more general theory books like *'The Pragmatic Programmer'* (started a few days ago - as recommended in stackoverflow question 1711) is going to continue to help me become a better programmer and having stackoverflow is great with the quality of questions and answers provided. 

Do you use any other Project Euler-esq sites that are Mac Centric (or at least object oriented) with less math( i.e complete task move on to harder related task)? If not is there another resouce that I'm missing that I should be using to help become better. 


I know there are related questions for other programming languages. But I wanted to ask specifically for iOS and Mac development.

I have a UIViewController to which I have added a 320x440 UIScrollView at 0,0 followed by a 320x20 UIProgressBar at 0,440.  It looks fine in Storyboard editor. I'm not entirely sure  how the 20 pixel status bar at the top of the screen is accommodated given the CGRect frame coordinates that Storyboard calculates.

On loading ( in `-(void)viewDidLoad` ), the UIScrollView frame seems to be set to **320x460**  pixels at 0,0 but the UIProgressBar is still 320x20 at 0,440.

When I add subviews to the UIScrollView, (UIImageViews in particular), they get stretched and get clipped on the screen because although the UIScrollView thinks it is 460 pixels high, it only has 440 pixels of screen to display in.

It turns out after few searching on internet that Apple is going to replace Google Maps with some new advance 3D maps build by company called C3. ([One of the researched resource][1]). Well now I am worried of my already written code,

Should I delay my development work until this new technology gets in? or just wait until Apple announces officially.

The call itself works fine. I get the results as expected, the ""thisRoomNumber"" comes back with what I expect it to be. Once the calling method kicks out to the next part it goes back to the delegate, at which point it crashes. I know it's tough to see whats going on without a lot of code to use, but the sheer amount of code would make this post MASSIVE.

Hopefully this will give us a starting point to fixing this. Also, the crash log dump gives absolutely nothing useful for this.

",objective-c,cocoa-touch,sqlite3,,,,open,0,959,5,"iOS + sqlite issues (EXC_BAD_ACCESS) I have a really strange one. I have a method that works perfectly fine, but I am trying to convert it to make the data more database driven vs the hardcoding that currently exists. When I add a call to my database method to pull the data, I'm getting an EXC_BAD_ACCESS long AFTER the database stuff is done. I've narrowed it down to the database stuff, since if I don't make the call at all, the crash doesn't happen.

So, the call to the method looks like this (this is where if I comment out, it doesn't crash):

    NSString *thisRoomNumber = [self readLocationsFromDatabaseBetweenPoints:fX YPoint:fY];

and the method itself looks like this:

    - (NSString *)readLocationsFromDatabaseBetweenPoints:(float)tapPointX YPoint:(float)tapPointY{

I have a self-proclaimed strong grasp of the Java language, so it's not a *terribly difficult* transition – it sure is fun though. But alas, my question!

I'm attempting to reproduce something that exists in PHP:  Late Static Binding. In PHP, I can decorate a method call with ""static::"", which will dynamically bind that method to the caller at runtime. On the other hand, if the keyword ""self::"" is used, the binding is static and is associated with the class in which it resides, regardless of which child class calls it.

In Obj-C, I'm having difficulty reproducing this paradigm. I've asked my overlord, Google, how to late statically bind in Cocoa, but I don't think it's possible. It may be called something else, or it may require a very over-my-head workaround. Here's what I'm doing now:

Parent Class Method:

    -(id) whoAmI {
     return ([self class]);
    }

A child class, ChildClass, extends ParentClass and does not override instance method whoAmI.

    NSLog(@""Calling from PARENT: %@"", [parent whoAmI]);
    NSLog(@""Calling from CHILD: %@"", [child whoAmI]);

 When I send the message to each of the class objects, dynamic binding does what it's supposed to do, and I get the following from NSLog():

2010-09-21 11:39:07.486 WhoAmI[4803:a0f] Calling from CHILD: Child**

Ultimately, I want to learn – if possible – how to get Cocoa to stop dynamically binding so that the whoAmI method always returns the object in which it resides (always Parent). I also want it to be an instance method. How would I go about doing this?

    [((Website*)[self.websites objectAtIndex:[self.tableView indexPathForSelectedRow].row]).websiteData writeToURL:url atomically:true];
    [webView loadRequest:[NSURLRequest requestWithURL:url]];

In the first line I'm creating an NSURL where the Webarchive will be written to from the database.
In the second line I am getting the webarchive from the database and write it to the disk at the url.
In the third line I'm loading the webarchive from disk into the WebView.

Can anybody point me into the right direction on how to load webarchives into a UIWebView?

Now I want to display these WebArchives in the UIWebView in iOS.
The problem is that I don't know how to do that.

In a similar post to this ([here][1]) Digital Robot said, that Webarchives are supported on iOS and I only have to load it from disk with a simple NSURLRequest into the UIWebView.
The problem here is, that it doesn't get loaded - I only get a blank UIWebView.

    ",objective-c,ios,,,,,open,0,370,12,"Can't get contents of file from a .plist file into an array I'm trying to create a create a simple app where I have a TableView that should display the contents of a file. I have created a Table View in IB and dragged it's delegate and data source to the file's owner and I have manually created a .plist file with 1 array that have 2 items.

In my TableViewController.h i have declared an array. 

    NSArray * posts;

In my implementation file I have declared the required methods for UITableViewDataSource like this:

    - (NSInteger)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView numberOfRowsInSection:(NSInteger)section 
    {
        NSLog(@""Returning num sections"");
        return posts.count;

    - (UITableViewCell *)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView  cellForRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath
    {
        // create a cell 
        UITableViewCell * post = [[UITableViewCell alloc]    
        initWithStyle:UITableViewCellStyleDefault reuseIdentifier:@""post""];
    
        // fill it with content 
        post.textLabel.text = [posts objectAtIndex:indexPath.row];
    
        // return it
        return post;
    } 

And in my ViewController 'viewDidLoad' method I try to add the content of my file to the 'posts' array like this:

    - (void)viewDidLoad
    {
    
        NSString * postFile = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@""Posts"" ofType:@""plist""];
        posts = [[NSArray alloc] initWithContentsOfFile:postFile];

 Am I leaking memory and if so, how can I correct it?

The problem is that within the scope of UserTabBarController, <code>assets.count</code> remains at 0, while within the scope of the Block, it shows the count as increasing, and it persists between both calls (as I would have expected). What I also find strange is that the lines Asset count: 0, should be appearing much later in the log, or maybe the lines of seeing assets (which are called from within the block) should be happening sooner:

                 ^

And I search and found out it's because box2d is written in c++, and you have to set all source files referring to box2d to *.mm, so apple compiler can compile it as object-c++.

So I just changed every source files into *.mm and it worked.

So I did some test.
I create a new and sample project from one of those templates, and I put iPhone wax into it and it works fine.

(In case you’re new to the concept: When a window, usually a panel, runs modal, it prevents some other part of the app from responding until it has been dismissed.)

“ModalForWindow” means different things in different circumstances.
If you are using loadNibNamed to display a panel defined by a xib and you want it to run modal, call this once it is displayed:

    // Make panelReviewImports modal, so that no other part of app will respond.
	[[NSApplication sharedApplication] runModalForWindow:self.panelReviewImports];
and follow up with this in its dismissal methods:

    [[NSApplication sharedApplication] stopModal];

But for NSAlert, the “window” in beginSheetModalForWindow refers to the window to which the alert will be **attached** as a sheet, which window will be frozen until the alert is dismissed. But the **app** won’t be frozen; all other windows will remain operable.
If you want to attach an alert as a sheet and **also**
 freeze the rest of the app, follow the beginSheet code with a simple call to runModal and use the return code explicitly, like this:

    [alert beginSheetModalForWindow:self.window

Maybe the following tip will save somebody some time:

(In case you’re new to the concept: When a window, usually a panel, runs modal, it prevents some other part of the app from responding until it has been dismissed.)

“ModalForWindow” means different things in different circumstances.
If you are using loadNibNamed to display a panel defined by a xib and you want it to run modal, call this once it is displayed:

    // Make panelReviewImports modal, so that no other part of app will respond.
	[[NSApplication sharedApplication] runModalForWindow:self.panelReviewImports];
and follow up with this in its dismissal methods:

    [[NSApplication sharedApplication] stopModal];

I have a window and three sepearate views in a nib file in IB. The three views are used for the three 'parts' of the program: the first were the user drops a file, the second where it chooses some options and the third where it is presented with a progress bar as the program accomplishes a task.

I want to animate between those views as they change, and I'm doing a fade-in/out animation. The goal is to have the old view (the one that is going to disappear) fade out as the new view fades in. The views have different sizes, so I animate the window frame as well at the same time (those views fill up the window). All three views have Core Animation enabled in IB, but nothing else (the window's content view for example) has.

**Code**

At the start of the program, I register the views' sizes so I can use them later, add the views to the window and set the 2nd and 3rd view hidden.


    - (void)awakeFromNib
    {
        // Register native views' size (when they get displayed again the window can be set to their bounds)
        view1NativeSize = [firstView bounds].size;
        view2NativeSize = [secondView bounds].size;
        view3NativeSize = [thirdView bounds].size;
        
        // Add views to the main window's content view
        NSRect viewFrame = [[mainWindow contentView] bounds];
        [firstView setFrame: viewFrame];
        [secondView setFrame: viewFrame];
        [thirdView setFrame: viewFrame];
        
        [[mainWindow contentView] addSubview: firstView];
        [[mainWindow contentView] addSubview: secondView];
        [[mainWindow contentView] addSubview: thirdView];
        
        // Set their attributes
        [secondView setHidden: TRUE];
        [thirdView setHidden: TRUE];

        currView = 1;
    }

Then I have three methods for swapping between views, where I calculate the new window frame and call a method for the animation.

    - (IBAction)goToFirstView: (id)sender
    {        
        NSRect newFrame = [mainWindow frame];
        newFrame.size = view1NativeSize;
        newFrame.size.height += [self titleBarHeight]; // Method that returns the title bar height
        
        if (currView == 1) {
            return;
        }
        else if (currView == 2) {
            [self animateFromView: secondView toView: firstView andWindowFrame: newFrame];
            currView--;
        }
        else if (currView == 3) {
            [self animateFromView: thirdView toView: firstView andWindowFrame: newFrame];
            currView -= 2;
        }
    }
    - (IBAction)goToSecondView: (id)sender
    {

The method for the animation is pretty straightforward. I animate the views.

    - (void)animateFromView: (NSView*)oldView
                     toView: (NSView*)newView
             andWindowFrame: (NSRect)newWindowFrame
    {
        [NSAnimationContext beginGrouping];
        [[NSAnimationContext currentContext] setDuration: 0.5];
        
        [[newView animator] setHidden: FALSE];
        [[oldView animator] setHidden: TRUE];
        //[[mainWindow animator] setFrame: newWindowFrame]; --Doesn't work??
        
        [NSAnimationContext endGrouping];
        
        [mainWindow setFrame: newWindowFrame display: YES animate: YES];
    }

**Questions**

I have two problems with this (most important first):

 - On the third view there is a progress indicator and it never displays correctly. It doesn't update! I call -startAnimation: but it doesn't move at all. If i turn off CA on that third layer it won't fade in/out correctly but the progress bar starts to work (animate). No clue why...

 - In my numerous experiments trying to solve the first problem I tried turning on CA for the window's content view and turning off CA for the three subviews. The first problem wasn't solved, but I noticed something: that way the old view was fading out AS the new view faded in, while before that change (subviews with CA) I could only notice the new view fading in. I recorded it and watched it in sloooowww-moootion :) and found I was right: the old view magically disappears and all I see is the new view fading in. It's funny I only found that after watching the animation I really wanted. Am I supposed to turn CA on only for the content view or for all three subviews separately? (or is this problem from something else?)

I tried many things like turning on CA for the progress bar. I found also many questions here that are close to this one but don't specifically address the progress bar problem.

Good luck finding a solution :)",objective-c,cocoa,animation,core-animation,nsview,,open,0,1409,3,"Animating sibling NSViews **Background & Goal**

I have a window and three sepearate views in a nib file in IB. The three views are used for the three 'parts' of the program: the first were the user drops a file, the second where it chooses some options and the third where it is presented with a progress bar as the program accomplishes a task.

I want to animate between those views as they change, and I'm doing a fade-in/out animation. The goal is to have the old view (the one that is going to disappear) fade out as the new view fades in. The views have different sizes, so I animate the window frame as well at the same time (those views fill up the window). All three views have Core Animation enabled in IB, but nothing else (the window's content view for example) has.

**Code**

At the start of the program, I register the views' sizes so I can use them later, add the views to the window and set the 2nd and 3rd view hidden.


    - (void)awakeFromNib
    {
        // Register native views' size (when they get displayed again the window can be set to their bounds)
        view1NativeSize = [firstView bounds].size;
        view2NativeSize = [secondView bounds].size;
        view3NativeSize = [thirdView bounds].size;
        
        // Add views to the main window's content view
        NSRect viewFrame = [[mainWindow contentView] bounds];
        [firstView setFrame: viewFrame];
        [secondView setFrame: viewFrame];
        [thirdView setFrame: viewFrame];
        
        [[mainWindow contentView] addSubview: firstView];
        [[mainWindow contentView] addSubview: secondView];
        [[mainWindow contentView] addSubview: thirdView];
        
        // Set their attributes
        [secondView setHidden: TRUE];
        [thirdView setHidden: TRUE];

        currView = 1;
    }

Then I have three methods for swapping between views, where I calculate the new window frame and call a method for the animation.

    - (IBAction)goToFirstView: (id)sender
    {        
        NSRect newFrame = [mainWindow frame];
        newFrame.size = view1NativeSize;
        newFrame.size.height += [self titleBarHeight]; // Method that returns the title bar height
        
        if (currView == 1) {
            return;
        }
        else if (currView == 2) {
            [self animateFromView: secondView toView: firstView andWindowFrame: newFrame];
            currView--;
        }
        else if (currView == 3) {
            [self animateFromView: thirdView toView: firstView andWindowFrame: newFrame];
            currView -= 2;
        }
    }
    - (IBAction)goToSecondView: (id)sender
    {
        NSRect newFrame = [mainWindow frame];
        newFrame.size = view2NativeSize;
        newFrame.size.height += [self titleBarHeight];
        
        if (currView == 2) {
            return;
        }
        else if (currView == 1) {
            [self animateFromView: firstView toView: secondView andWindowFrame: newFrame];
            currView++;
        }
        else if (currView == 3) {        
            [self animateFromView: thirdView toView: secondView andWindowFrame: newFrame];
            currView--;
        }
    }
    - (IBAction)goToThirdView: (id)sender
    {
        NSRect newFrame = [mainWindow frame];
        newFrame.size = view3NativeSize;
        newFrame.size.height += [self titleBarHeight];
        
        if (currView == 3) {
            return;
        }
        else if (currView == 1) {
            [self animateFromView: firstView toView: thirdView andWindowFrame: newFrame];
            currView += 2;
        }
        else if (currView == 2) {
            [self animateFromView: secondView toView: thirdView andWindowFrame: newFrame];
            currView++;
        }
    }

The method for the animation is pretty straightforward. I animate the views.

    - (void)animateFromView: (NSView*)oldView
                     toView: (NSView*)newView
             andWindowFrame: (NSRect)newWindowFrame
    {
        [NSAnimationContext beginGrouping];
        [[NSAnimationContext currentContext] setDuration: 0.5];
        
        [[newView animator] setHidden: FALSE];
        [[oldView animator] setHidden: TRUE];
        //[[mainWindow animator] setFrame: newWindowFrame]; --Doesn't work??
        
        [NSAnimationContext endGrouping];
        
        [mainWindow setFrame: newWindowFrame display: YES animate: YES];
    }

Each terrain is stored in a raw data file which represents a string of (float) height values. So far I can read the files in sequence into memory, and dynamically create a mesh based on height values each frame (and the framerate is actually reasonable), but I am maxing out at around 20 frames before my app quits with no error or stack trace.

I suspect that I am approaching this incorrectly. How would I stream this data so that I don't have to hold each frame in memory?

Josh",objective-c,optimization,memory,streaming,opengl-es-2.0,,open,0,1088,11,"OpenGLES2 iOS: How best to stream vertex animation for dynamic terrain? I'm writing an app that creates a dynamic 640*480 terrain (changes every frame). Each terrain is stored in a raw data file which represents a string of (float) height values. So far I can read the files in sequence into memory, and dynamically create a mesh based on height values each frame (and the framerate is actually reasonable), but I am maxing out at around 20 frames before my app quits with no error or stack trace.

I suspect that I am approaching this incorrectly. How would I stream this data so that I don't have to hold each frame in memory?

I also tried using Animation delegates and using the animationDidStop, but it didn't seem to work either.

    - (void)walkAnimation {
        [UIView beginAnimations:nil context:nil];
        [UIView setAnimationDuration:2];
        [UIView setAnimationRepeatCount:2];
        [UIView setAnimationCurve:UIViewAnimationCurveEaseInOut];
        [UIView setAnimationRepeatAutoreverses:TRUE];
        CGAffineTransform bobUP = CGAffineTransformMakeTranslation(0, -10);
        //CGAffineTransform bobDOWN = CGAffineTransformMakeTranslation(0, +10);
        //CGAffineTransform bob = CGAffineTransformConcat(bobUP, bobDOWN);
        _spriteLayer.affineTransform = bobUP;
        [UIView commitAnimations];
        _spriteLayer.affineTransform = CGAffineTransformIdentity;
    }",3

But their advice seems ambiguous and possibly contradictory, and I want to make sure I've understood it properly.

Previously the accepted wisdom seemed to be that a `NSManagedObjectContext` could only be accessed from the thread that created it, and that using a serial queue for synchronisation was not sufficient; although serial queues only perform one operation at a time, these operations can potentially be scheduled on different threads, and a MOC doesn't like that.

But now, from the programming guide, we have:
> You can use threads, serial operation queues, or dispatch queues for concurrency. For the sake of conciseness, this article uses “thread” throughout to refer to any of these.

So far, so good (although their conflation of threads and queues is unhelpful). So I can safely use a single context per (serial) queue, instead of one per operation/block, right? Apple even has a visual depiction of this in the Core Data WWDC sessions.

But... where do you create the context for the queue? In the `NSManagedObjectContext` documentation, Apple state:
> [A context] assumes the default owner is the thread or queue that allocated it—this is determined by the thread that calls its init method. You should not, therefore, initialize a context on one thread then pass it to a different thread.

So now we have the idea of a `NSManagedObjectContext` needing to know who its owner is. I'm assuming this means that the first operation to be executed in the queue should create the MOC and save a reference to it for the remaining operations to use.

Is this right? The only reason I'm hesitant is that the `NSManagedObjectContext` article goes on to say:
> Instead, you should pass a reference to a persistent store coordinator and have the receiving thread/queue create a new context derived from that. If you use NSOperation, you must create the context in main (for a serial queue) or start (for a concurrent queue).

Apple now seem to be conflating operations with the queues that schedule their execution. This does my head in, and makes me wonder if they really do want you to just create a new MOC for every operation after all. What am I missing?

I already have a method in this class that can rotate the object, I know I'll probably use it to make this class. Thank you. ",5

I have an iOS app that crashes almost every time it wakes from the background.  I just wanted to see if anyone had any thoughts on this, or ways to track it down.

Here is the stack trace, almost every time it is very similar:

",objective-c,ios,crash,,,02/25/2012 19:44:08,not a real question,1,3007,12,"iOS app crashes (almost) every time when coming back from the background I've been trying to track this down for awhile with no luck.  I have an iOS app that crashes almost every time it wakes from the background.  I just wanted to see if anyone had any thoughts on this, or ways to track it down.

Here is the stack trace, almost every time it is very similar:

ARC is turned on.

The controls display fine, but I'm having trouble getting the event handler for buttons to work from the helper class.  The program ends with a EXC_BAD_ACCESS and no error messages in the debug console.

So my question is:
1) Is it possible to have addtarget (and event handling method) in a class that doesn't inherit from UIView (like my generic objectc helper class)?

2) If yes, what do I specify as the target action (since 'self' may not work, and I need to refer to the class that displays the screen - i.e. the ViewController, see below)?

3) How do I get to a stack trace or more detailed debug methods in XCode so I could trace why the app crashes??

To explain further:

Within MyViewController:viewDidLoad, I do:

    ControlBuilders *cb = [[Controller alloc] BuildControls];
    // calls property ConstructedScreen for the built screen
    UIView *v = cb.ConstructedScreen;

    [self.view addsubview v];


within BuildControls, I have:

    UIButton *b = [[UIButton alloc] init ];
    b = [UIButton buttonWithType:UIButtonTypeCustom];
    [b setTitle:@""Click Me!"" forState:UIControlStateNormal];
    [b setFrame:CGRectMake(10, 10, 100, 30)];
    [b addTarget:self action:@selector(buttonPressed:) forControlEvents:UIControlEventTouchUpInside];

    [ConstructedScreen addsubview b];

- Here is the 'self' in the addTarget:self

The buttonPressed method does:

    - (void)buttonPressed: (id) sender {
       NSLog(@""\nButton Pressed: %@"", sender);
    }

When the button 'Click Me!' is pressed, program just crashes with the EXC_BAD_ACCESS error and no further debug messages.

1) Is it possible to have addtarget (and event handling method) in a class that doesn't inherit from UIView (like my generic objectc helper class)?

2) If yes, what do I specify as the target action (since 'self' may not work, and I need to refer to the class that displays the screen - i.e. the ViewController, see below)?

3) How do I get to a stack trace or more detailed debug methods in XCode so I could trace why the app crashes??

To explain further:

Within MyViewController:viewDidLoad, I do:

    ControlBuilders *cb = [[Controller alloc] BuildControls];
    // calls property ConstructedScreen for the built screen
    UIView *v = cb.ConstructedScreen;

    [self.view addsubview v];


within BuildControls, I have:

    UIButton *b = [[UIButton alloc] init ];
    b = [UIButton buttonWithType:UIButtonTypeCustom];
    [b setTitle:@""Click Me!"" forState:UIControlStateNormal];
    [b setFrame:CGRectMake(10, 10, 100, 30)];
    [b addTarget:self action:@selector(buttonPressed:) forControlEvents:UIControlEventTouchUpInside];

    [ConstructedScreen addsubview b];

- Here is the 'self' in the addTarget:self

The buttonPressed method does:

    - (void)buttonPressed: (id) sender {
       NSLog(@""\nButton Pressed: %@"", sender);
    }

When the button 'Click Me!' is pressed, program just crashes with the EXC_BAD_ACCESS error and no further debug messages.

This question may seem a bit long, but I try to give as much information as possible, since I am really staggered by this.

I am currently working an a [library][1] which should automate XML document parsing. But I am running into a problem now testing the library for the first time.

I have a library class called `CSXDocumentLayout` which represents the layout of a document. This class contains the private method `- (NSError *)readLayoutDocument:(NSString *)fpath` called from an init method.

    /* MARK: Reading in Layouts */
    - (NSError *)readLayoutDocument:(NSString *)fpath {
        CSXDocumentLayout *layout;
        CSXXMLParser *parser;
        BOOL state;
        
        layout = [CSXDocumentLayout layoutDocumentLayout];
        
        parser = [[CSXXMLParser alloc] initWithDocumentLayouts:
                  [NSArray arrayWithObject:layout]];
        parser.file = fpath;
        
        state = [parser parse];
        
        if(state == NO || parser.error != nil) {
            return parser.error;
        }
        return nil;
    }

This method will read in an XML document representing the layout of an other XML document. It is parsed by the class `CSXXMLParser`, which I want to test.

I create an object representing a layout document with `+[CSXDocumentLayout layoutDocumentLayout]`. This method is implemented in the category `CSXDocumentLayout (CSXLayoutObject)`.

",objective-c,cocoa,extension-methods,foundation,unrecognized-selector,,open,0,1283,10,"""unrecognized selector sent to class"" when calling from a library # Problem
This question may seem a bit long, but I try to give as much information as possible, since I am really staggered by this.

I am currently working an a [library][1] which should automate XML document parsing. But I am running into a problem now testing the library for the first time.

I have a library class called `CSXDocumentLayout` which represents the layout of a document. This class contains the private method `- (NSError *)readLayoutDocument:(NSString *)fpath` called from an init method.

    /* MARK: Reading in Layouts */
    - (NSError *)readLayoutDocument:(NSString *)fpath {
        CSXDocumentLayout *layout;
        CSXXMLParser *parser;
        BOOL state;
        
        layout = [CSXDocumentLayout layoutDocumentLayout];
        
        parser = [[CSXXMLParser alloc] initWithDocumentLayouts:
                  [NSArray arrayWithObject:layout]];
        parser.file = fpath;
        
        state = [parser parse];
        
        if(state == NO || parser.error != nil) {
            return parser.error;
        }
        return nil;
    }

This method will read in an XML document representing the layout of an other XML document. It is parsed by the class `CSXXMLParser`, which I want to test.

I create an object representing a layout document with `+[CSXDocumentLayout layoutDocumentLayout]`. This method is implemented in the category `CSXDocumentLayout (CSXLayoutObject)`.

Below is my test file:

    #import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
    #import <CeasyXML.h>
    
    int main(int argc, const char **argv) {
        NSAutoreleasePool *pool = [NSAutoreleasePool new];
        
        NSString *file;
        
        file = [NSString stringWithUTF8String:__FILE__];
        file = [file stringByDeletingLastPathComponent];
        file = [file stringByAppendingPathComponent:@""Layout.xml""];
        
        CSXDocumentLayout *layout;
        NSError *error;
        
        layout = [[CSXDocumentLayout alloc] initWithLayoutDocument:file 
                                                             error:&error];
        if(layout == nil) {
            NSLog(@""Could not create layout: %@"", error);
            exit(0);
        }
        
        NSLog(@""Layout:\n%@"", layout);
        
        [pool release];
        return 0;
    }

When building in the spirit of MVC, I understand it as you Model and View should never talk to eachother.

   attributes like numberOfSides.
   
 - A controller, reading some UI

 - A view, containing a view drawing
   polygons.


Now, this is where the trouble arose. The view needs information about the object from the model. How do I get that? I tried some IBOutlet, but never got it to work.

I ended up creating a property for the view which could contain numberOfSides. Then I would a controller method which would call a view method back and set the numberOfSides.


I hope some of you can clarify this a bit for me and tell me how you should go ahead with this.

Now, this is where the trouble arose. The view needs information about the object from the model. How do I get that? I tried some IBOutlet, but never got it to work.

I ended up creating a property for the view which could contain numberOfSides. Then I would a controller method which would call a view method back and set the numberOfSides.


I hope some of you can clarify this a bit for me and tell me how you should go ahead with this.


Thanks a bunch and goodnight! :)",3

I have these sizes of circles that changes using a UISlider and draws on touch.

Now, i am trying give it a new style on how it will draw on the screen on touch, and it's like this, when the user holds the touch (for example he's on the middle size circle) it'll start form the smallest size and stops on its current size but when the user just tap the screen very quick it'll just draw the smallest size no matter what's the size is...

how will i able to that??

here's my current code:
 On touchesBegan:


    if(!touchSwiped) {
            UIGraphicsBeginImageContext(self.view.frame.size);
    		[drawView.image drawInRect:CGRectMake(0, 0, 768, 1024)];
            CGContextRef context = UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext();
    		CGContextSetLineCap(context, kCGLineCapRound);
    		CGContextSetLineWidth(context, lineWidth);
    		CGContextSetRGBStrokeColor(context, color1, color2, color3, alpha);
            CGContextSetBlendMode(context, blendMode);
    		CGContextMoveToPoint(context, endingPoint.x, endingPoint.y);

The sub classes have the same method: SubMethodA. This method is written the exact same way for both subclasses. It's differences are in it's execution. Within SubMethodA, it calls SubMethodB which executes differently depending on the subclass. 

I figured I could move SubMethodA to Base but of course Base doesn't know about SubMethodB.

• First Try:
 I added the prototype for SubMethodA and it's implementation to Base class. I then added to the interface of Base the prototype for SubMethodB. In the implementation for Base, I implemented SubMethodB as an empty stub. This would allow for a ""pass thru"" to the subclass; the subclass would override SubMethodB. This worked but something felt wrong about it. Having an empty stub just to get this to work doesn't feel correct. Not sure why but my inner programmer was not happy.

• Second Try:
 I left the SubMethodB prototype in the Base header. I removed the empty stub and of course I got an, ""Incomplete Implementation"" warning. Compiles and runs correctly but is not correct.

• Third Try:
 I removed the prototype from the Base header. The last warning was gone but I got a new one. ""Instance method '-SubMethodB:' not found (return type defaults to 'id')"". Again the warning makes sense and the code runs properly but this is not correct.

• Fourth Try:
 I made a @protocol called ""BaseProtocol"" which is implemented by both subclasses; SubA and SubB. I still have the same warning from the last try.

• Fifth Try:
 In a last ditch effort, I surrounded the offending code with ""[self conformsToProtocol:@protocol(BaseProtocol)]"" to see if the compiler would notice that I am checking to make sure that this method is really implemented by the subclass and not give me a warning but it didn't make difference. Same warning as last time. 

So here are my questions: 

- Is this idea of a base class calling a subclass's method a pipe dream or is there a way that this can be done properly without any warnings?
- Is my thought pattern incorrect in wanting to have the exact same code that is in 2 subclasses, in the base class?

I was using the orient value to rotate the image so that it appears 'up'.  Unfortunately, if I have an image that's taken in landscape mode the same code doesn't work because the orientations are incorrect.

I've tried instantiating timg using the scale:orientation: overload using orient for the orientation parameter, all it does is initialize the image setting the orientation but incorrectly rotates the image.

This seems non deterministic, how come these calls return different results:

The app lags incredibly when drawing in the free form mode. I believe it is because the view is too large and setNeedsDisplay is reloading the entire view every time the touches moved method is called. Is there a way to speed up the setNeedsDisplay method so the free form drawing does not lag on the iPad. Can i just target the context where the drawing is occurring not reload the whole thing? When I adjust the size to about 1000x1000 it does not have the lag problem.

The app lags incredibly when drawing in the free form mode. I believe it is because the view is too large and setNeedsDisplay is reloading the entire view every time the touches moved method is called. Is there a way to speed up the setNeedsDisplay method so the free form drawing does not lag on the iPad. Can i just target the context where the drawing is occurring not reload the whole thing? When I adjust the size to about 1000x1000 it does not have the lag problem. 

Thanks for any help on the matter.",4

I can switch tabs and see the First view or Second view depending on the chosen tab.

Now I add a new window (StartupView) with its own navigation controller (startupNavigationController). 

In the app delegate of the main window/application I do present the startup window as follows:

 
    @implementation NavigationAppDelegate

    @synthesize window=_window;
    @synthesize tabBarController=_tabBarController;
    @synthesize firstTabNavigationController;

    return YES;
    }

Immediately after showing it, I will remove it again (for simplicity, normally this will happen after an event).

Now the application launches, shows and hides the startupWindow, and shows the underlying main window again with the tabnavigation. However, there is one difference. Before adding and removing the modal startup window I was able to switch to another tab, now the application will abort when I switch tabs.

I get the message ""EXC_BAD_ACCESS"" in main.c. I have no clue what it tries to access though (what could have been accidentally be released in the meantime?).

I've been using Blocks and NSURLConnection to achieve this on the client side, but I'm getting frequent EXC_BAD_ACCESS crashes in objc_msgSend().

In iOS 5 there is the introduction of parent-child managed object contexts in CoreData.

I have a standard NSFetchedResultsController and UITableVeiwController working together to fetch a master list from the store. The fetched results controller's managed object context is a child with a parent context:

    // AppDelegate.m

    - (NSManagedObjectContext *)managedObjectContext
    {
        if (__managedObjectContext != nil)
        {
            return __managedObjectContext;
        }
    
        __managedObjectContext = [[NSManagedObjectContext alloc] initWithConcurrencyType:NSMainQueueConcurrencyType];

        // primary managed object context has NSPrivateQueueConcurrencyType
        [__managedObjectContext setParentContext:[self primaryObjectContext]];
        return __managedObjectContext;
    }

The table view controller presents a modal view controller to add a new record, but uses a separate managed object context to do so (this context is another child of the parent context). This context gets saved in a delegate callback in the table view controller:


    - (void)addGame
    {
        // New child context
    
        [self setBuildManagedObectContext:[[NSManagedObjectContext alloc] init]];
        [[self buildManagedObectContext] setParentContext:[[[self team] managedObjectContext] parentContext]];
    
        Team *buildTeam = (Team *)[[self buildManagedObectContext] objectWithID:[[self team] objectID]];
        Game *buildGame = [NSEntityDescription insertNewObjectForEntityForName:@""Game"" 
                                                    inManagedObjectContext:[self buildManagedObectContext]];
    
    
        [buildGame setTeam:buildTeam];
    
        BuildViewController *buildVC = [[BuildViewController alloc] initWithGame:buildGame delegate:self];
        UINavigationController *navCon = [[UINavigationController alloc] initWithRootViewController:buildVC];
        [[self navigationController] presentViewController:navCon animated:YES completion:nil];
    }

    #pragma mark - Build view controller delegate

    - (void)buildViewController:(BuildViewController *)controller didFinishWithSave:(BOOL)save
    {
        if (save)
        {
            NSError *error = nil;
            if (![[self buildManagedObectContext] save:&error])
            {
                NSLog(@""Error saving new game"");
                abort();
            }
        }
        [self setBuildManagedObectContext:nil];
        [[self navigationController] dismissViewControllerAnimated:YES completion:nil];
    }

Question:

It was my understanding that with parent-child contexts, the parent context would get the save notification from its child, and then notify all it's children. So in my example, the build context should trigger the parent context to tell the fetched results controller to merge the changes.

This isn't happening for me, the records are successfully created, but the fetched results controller isn't picking them up.  I know it used to be the case you had to implement you own merge from the save notification (as seen in [CoreDataBooks][1]). But I thought the child-parent contexts solved this issue. I tried saving the child and then the parent, but didn't seem to make a difference. Can someone explain this to me please? (Note: These are not contexts on separate/background threads)

Many Thanks

The subview is being added correctly, and stretches correctly *only if the window is exactly the same width as the custom view that I've created in IB*.

If the window opens wider than the custom view, it does not stretch properly. The window seems to open in exactly the same state as I left it (in Lion), which therefore means I have to set the width of the custom view to the restored window width  on launch.

How do I do this?

",objective-c,cocoa,window,nswindow,,,open,0,118,9,"Setting subview's width equal to window width on launch I'm struggling getting a subview (which is acting as a custom toolbar [I need a NSView rather than an NSToolbar]) centred within an INAppStoreWindow..

The subview is being added correctly, and stretches correctly *only if the window is exactly the same width as the custom view that I've created in IB*.

If the window opens wider than the custom view, it does not stretch properly. The window seems to open in exactly the same state as I left it (in Lion), which therefore means I have to set the width of the custom view to the restored window width  on launch.

How do I do this?

I've tried this in applicationDidFinishLaunching:

    toolbarView.frame.size.width = 480;
but it doesn't work..

Many thanks

In order to make this change, I have to have everything as part of a navigation controller so that I can change views (currently using subviews which won't work correctly).

I have modified my AppDelegate.h and AppDelegate.m to have references to new windows and views , however I just get a black screen on launch.

After using the debugger, I noticed that the window pointer is in AppDelegate is still pointing at memory address 0, after it should have been initialised to the window I connected it to using interface builder.

Clearly I am doing something completely wrong, and I have no idea where to go from here. I don't even know what information I should be providing. To be on the safe side here is my AppDelegate.h:

    @interface AppDelegate : NSObject <UIApplicationDelegate>

    @property (strong, nonatomic) IBOutlet UIWindow *window;
    @property (strong, nonatomic) IBOutlet UINavigationController *navigationController;
    @property (strong, nonatomic) IBOutlet InitialisationController *initialisationController;
    
    @end

and the didFinishLaunchingWithOptions method:

 - Is it suitable for larger applications? How large an application could it support?

so here are 2 asynchronous requests, in which I fire one after another. I want to change the value of the property tournamentText after the second request executes. 

Inside the completion block for the second request, when I NSLog self.tournamentText, it displays the text I want to retrieve.

Outside the block, an NSLog produces a nil.

What can I do to preserve the changes to self.tournamentText? Thanks in advanced! Please do tell me if I missed an Apple documentation on this.",3

I am facing a very strange issue with `UIImagepicker`

**Scenario**
An app that captures an image from `Front camera` automatically after 3 sec countdown.
Everything is working as expected.

**Code**

//in `viewWillAppear`

     if ([UIImagePickerController isSourceTypeAvailable:UIImagePickerControllerSourceTypeCamera]){
        imagePicker = [[UIImagePickerController alloc] init];
            self.imagePicker.sourceType =  UIImagePickerControllerSourceTypeCamera;

    self.imagePicker.showsCameraControls = NO;

    [self.view addSubview:self.imagePicker.view];
    [self.view bringSubviewToFront:self.imagePicker.view];
    }

**Problem**
I have never told the ipad to use its rear device Still in certain cases the rear camera starts.

**Steps to reproduce**

1. Hold the camera in `Landscape orientation` 
2. Click a photo (Will take you to next screen, pushed in Nav controller)
3. In th next screen tilt the ipad halfway towards `face up orientation`
4. Comeback to camera screen and you see it using rear camera.
 
This is a very strange behavior I am not even able to understand its cause.
",objective-c,ipad,camera,,,,open,0,194,9,"UIImagePicker Front Camera strange behavior on orientation in iPad This was the first time that I searched for a problem and was returned nothing by google or SO.

I am facing a very strange issue with `UIImagepicker`

**Scenario**
An app that captures an image from `Front camera` automatically after 3 sec countdown.
Everything is working as expected.

**Code**

//in `viewWillAppear`

     if ([UIImagePickerController isSourceTypeAvailable:UIImagePickerControllerSourceTypeCamera]){
        imagePicker = [[UIImagePickerController alloc] init];
            self.imagePicker.sourceType =  UIImagePickerControllerSourceTypeCamera;
    self.imagePicker.cameraDevice = UIImagePickerControllerCameraDeviceFront;
    self.imagePicker.delegate = self;
    self.imagePicker.showsCameraControls = NO;
    [self.imagePicker.view setFrame:kAppFrame];
    [self.view addSubview:self.imagePicker.view];
    [self.view bringSubviewToFront:self.imagePicker.view];
    }

**Problem**
I have never told the ipad to use its rear device Still in certain cases the rear camera starts.

**Steps to reproduce**

1. Hold the camera in `Landscape orientation` 
2. Click a photo (Will take you to next screen, pushed in Nav controller)

Any help is greatly appreciated.  Using Apples expanding tableview sections example, I've recreated the project nearly identical to what Apple has but with CoreData instead of a .PList.  My trouble area is with:
                   
    - (UITableViewCell *)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView cellForRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath                   *)indexPath
    {

        UINib *athleteCellNib = [UINib nibWithNibName:@""AthleteCell"" bundle:nil];
        [athleteCellNib instantiateWithOwner:self options:nil];
        cell = self.athleteCell;
        self.athleteCell = nil;
    }       

    theTeam = (Team *)[[self.sectionInfoArray objectAtIndex:indexPath.section] theTeam];
    cell.athlete = [[theTeam athletes]  objectAtIndex:indexPath.row];
athletes is a to-many relationship which is a NSSet.  I know sets don't play nicely with objectAtIndex and I just can't figure out how to write that line of code to make it work. I've put the set into an Array but have the issue then that my team object isn't aware of the array of athletes.
The relevant code from VeiwDidLoad is:
    
    NSFetchRequest *fetchRequest = [[NSFetchRequest alloc] init];
    NSEntityDescription *entity = [NSEntityDescription entityForName:@""Team"" inManagedObjectContext:managedObjectContext];
    [fetchRequest setIncludesSubentities:YES];
    [fetchRequest setEntity:entity];
    
    NSError *error = nil;
    NSArray *fetchedObjects = [managedObjectContext executeFetchRequest:fetchRequest error:&error];
    if (fetchedObjects == nil) 
    {
        // handle errors here
    }
    
    [fetchRequest release];
    self.teams = fetchedObjects;
 At this point, self.teams contains everything - teams and the related athletes.

    if ((self.sectionInfoArray == nil) || ([self.sectionInfoArray count] != [self numberOfSectionsInTableView:self.tableView])) 
    {
		
        // For each team, set up a corresponding SectionInfo object to contain the default height for each row.
		NSMutableArray *infoArray = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init];
		
		for (Team *team in self.teams) 
            //NSLog(@""%@"",team);
            
        {
			
			SectionInfo *sectionInfo = [[SectionInfo alloc] init];			
			sectionInfo.theTeam = team;

",objective-c,ios,xcode,,,,open,0,646,5,"Apple's TableViewUpdates example with CoreData I'm making this tougher then it is, I know the answer is right in my face and I'm just not seeing it!  Any help is greatly appreciated.  Using Apples expanding tableview sections example, I've recreated the project nearly identical to what Apple has but with CoreData instead of a .PList.  My trouble area is with:
                   
    - (UITableViewCell *)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView cellForRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath                   *)indexPath
    {
    
    static NSString *AthleteCellIdentifier = @""AthleteCellIdentifier"";
    
    AthleteCell *cell = (AthleteCell*)[tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier:AthleteCellIdentifier];
    
    if (!cell) 
    {
        
        UINib *athleteCellNib = [UINib nibWithNibName:@""AthleteCell"" bundle:nil];
        [athleteCellNib instantiateWithOwner:self options:nil];
        cell = self.athleteCell;
        self.athleteCell = nil;
    }       

    theTeam = (Team *)[[self.sectionInfoArray objectAtIndex:indexPath.section] theTeam];
    cell.athlete = [[theTeam athletes]  objectAtIndex:indexPath.row];
athletes is a to-many relationship which is a NSSet.  I know sets don't play nicely with objectAtIndex and I just can't figure out how to write that line of code to make it work. I've put the set into an Array but have the issue then that my team object isn't aware of the array of athletes.
The relevant code from VeiwDidLoad is:
    
    NSFetchRequest *fetchRequest = [[NSFetchRequest alloc] init];
    NSEntityDescription *entity = [NSEntityDescription entityForName:@""Team"" inManagedObjectContext:managedObjectContext];
    [fetchRequest setIncludesSubentities:YES];
    [fetchRequest setEntity:entity];
    
    NSError *error = nil;
    NSArray *fetchedObjects = [managedObjectContext executeFetchRequest:fetchRequest error:&error];
    if (fetchedObjects == nil) 
    {
        // handle errors here
    }
    
    [fetchRequest release];
    self.teams = fetchedObjects;
 At this point, self.teams contains everything - teams and the related athletes.

    if ((self.sectionInfoArray == nil) || ([self.sectionInfoArray count] != [self numberOfSectionsInTableView:self.tableView])) 
    {
		
        // For each team, set up a corresponding SectionInfo object to contain the default height for each row.
		NSMutableArray *infoArray = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init];
		
		for (Team *team in self.teams) 
            //NSLog(@""%@"",team);
            
        {
			
			SectionInfo *sectionInfo = [[SectionInfo alloc] init];			
			sectionInfo.theTeam = team;
			sectionInfo.open = NO;
            //NSLog(@""%@"",sectionInfo.theTeam);
			
            NSNumber *defaultRowHeight = [NSNumber numberWithInteger:DEFAULT_ROW_HEIGHT];
            NSInteger countOfAthletes = [[sectionInfo.theTeam athletes] count];
            //NSLog(@""%@"",[sectionInfo.theTeam athletes]);
			for (NSInteger i = 0; i < countOfAthletes; i++) 
            {
				[sectionInfo insertObject:defaultRowHeight inRowHeightsAtIndex:i];
			}
			
			[infoArray addObject:sectionInfo];
            //NSLog(@""%@"",sectionInfo);
		}
		self.sectionInfoArray = infoArray;
	}

I've specified 'complete' because I'm more interested for current purposes in strategy than tactics (but hopefully the code will be tactically well-made too). 'Complete' needn't mean 'large'.

My own initial priorities would be that the overall design be cocoa-idiomatic (ie. make good use of what Apple have provided for us), with a heavy emphasis on classes being as decoupled as is possible within the relevant design constraints.

I have a simple question concerning how to call multiple variables in a sentence-style text with other words in between the variables.

I'm teaching myself iPhone application development, so I'm basing this code off the instructions by Apple entitled ""Your First iOS App"" and tweaking the code to learn it better.

The basic layout of the app is two text fields labeled ""Name"" and ""Occupation"". Below that is a text area (label) and a button for submitting the text field information. Once the user inputs and submits their Name and Occupation, the application should place those variables into the sentence: ""Hello, my name is [Name], and I'm a [Occupation]."" and display the sentence in the text area (label).

This is what I have so far:

    - (IBAction)changeGreeting:(id)sender {
    
    self.userName = self.textField.text;
    
    NSString *nameString = self.userName;
    if ([nameString length] == 0) {
        nameString = @""Name"";
    }
        NSString *greeting = [[NSString alloc] initWithFormat:@""Hello, my name is %@,"", nameString];
    self.label.text = greeting;
    
    self.userOccupation = self.textField.text;
    
    NSString *occupationString = self.userOccupation;

    if (theTextField == self.textField) {
        [theTextField resignFirstResponder];
    }
    return YES;
    }

I have a class that takes in XML int the form of an `NSString`, parses out some objects and returns them in an `NSArray` somewhat like this:

    //Parser.m
    +(NSString *)parseMessagesFromXml:(NSString *)xml
    {
       NSMutableArray *messages = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init];
       
       //do some work parsing the xml
       //for each <row>
       //   Message *m = makeMessageFromRow(row);

       return [messages autorelease];
    }

Then in my view controller class I declare an NSArray:

    //MyViewController.h
    NSArray *messages;
    @property (nonatomic, retain) NSArray *messages;

and assign it using the above method:

    //MyViewController.m
    messages = [Parser parseMessageFromXml:xml];
    [[self tableView] reloadData];

So here comes the problem: when i assign the array to `messages` it has elements in it, but they are all ""out of scope."" I have debugged the problem and I know that the parsing method is correctly creating the objects and adding them to the `NSMutableArray` before returning it. When I try to access the objects in `messages` my app crashes and the debugger says `EXC_BAD_ACCESS`. What is more peculiar is this: if i store the array into a local variable it works just fine:

    NSArray *temp = [Parser parseMessageFromXml:xml]; 
    //temp has all the right objects and they are in scope
    
    messages = temp;
    //messages has the objects, but cannot access them (they are out of scope).

It is as if I can legally view them in a local scope, but i cannot assign them to a member variable. I have even tried iterating over the returned array, adding each one to `messages` individually, but the result is the same: they are out of scope. I am totally clueless on this one.

What is it about `messages` as a member variable that doesn't allow it to hold these objects?

One way I can think of doing this is to have a callback which is called every time a frame is about to display or is ready to be displayed - is anyone familiar with such a callback?

Another way would be to have a timer which uses -currentFrameImage and compares it with the last frame image it tested - however firstly I don't know how you would go about comparing two NSImages, and secondly I would imagine this would be problematic if two sequential frames were the same, it would effectively assume a frame was dropped when it was not

The last way I can think of would be to again use a timer, this time to call -currentTime. I have tried this, however for some reason the timeScale is set to 1000000000. I have read (at http://jongampark.wordpress.com/2008/10/27/qttime-qtstringtime-and-smpte/) that the time scale is supposed to be 100*fps. So why is currentTime returning that the FPS is 10000000? This seems completely incorrect. There are no flags set in the QTTime returned.

At this point why does currentRow care about the data from another function, since it already has what it want (a value from getRow()).

The second function is a button the gets the second word:<BR>

    -(IBAction)btnLastName:(id)sender{
    lastNamelabel.text = currentRow.lastName; //<---Crashes the program
    }
<BR>
So, as you can see, using currentRow against causes the program to crash, and what I can't understand is that if I don't release rowPlaceholder the program works fine.  At this point why does currentRow care about the data from another function, since it already has what it want (a value from getRow()).

In above code. I have three dealloc functions.
Which one is preferable? If none of these, then please suggest yours.
I am confused, just because - ""Objective c"" says, object must be released each time = each time alloc/retained.

But most of the sample code has just single statement ""[xyz release];"" doen't it create memory leak?

Thanks in advance for your explanation.

If I declare aInt and aFract as Double, the processing results correctly in '2.0000' and '30.0000' but converting '30.0000' into a integer results ""interestingly"" in '29' again.

Then I would have tableview headers like ""April 5"", ""April 2"", ""April 1"". Therefore each would have 2, 2 and 1 row under each corresponding header

Essentially, my wanted outcome would be an NSDictionary. It's each key would be a date (2010-04-02), each value would be an NSArray of the correct objects to go with it. All of these should be sorted by date. Newest first.

Well, while this might be true, you can still enjoy the functionality that you might expect from subclassing NSMutableArray. To do this, you subclass it and overwrite all the necessary methods and provide it with a backing store: NSMutableArray

Here is how it works:

CSSMutableArray.h:

    #import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
    
    
    @interface CSSMutableArray : NSMutableArray {
    	NSMutableArray *_backingStore;
    }

                  PID = [app processIdentifier];
           }
          NSLog(@""found iTunes: %d %@"",(int)PID,WID);

          CGEventPostToPSN(&psn, CGEvent);
    
        }

The problem is that I cannot see the mouse click being performed. 

Any help would be much appreciated

thank you

Why does Xcode indent lines so bloody far? Being an old Perl, Ruby, and JavaScript monkey, I would be more inclined to indent it manually like this:


        UIAlertView *alert = [[UIAlertView alloc]
            initWithTitle:     @""Do you like my hat?""
            message:           @""If so, please help spread the word by rating our app now?""

            otherButtonTitles: @""Sure!"", @""Maybe Later"", nil
        ];

So the parameter names and values are all left-aligned, and indented only one level (4 spaces for me). This uses far less screen real-estate, and it's less likely I'll have to deal with wrapping lines (which make the far-right indented stuff even trickier to read) on my MacBook Air.

However, I assume there's some reason Apple prefers the first method, and therefore has Xcode indent that way. Or is there?

So I have two question:

* How do you prefer to indent method parameters in your Objective C code?
* How do you tweak Xcode to format with your preferred indentation style?

Not trying to start a holy war here; I'm more curious about what tend to be the best practices among Objective-C programmers, how Xcode helps with those practices, and to find out if there is a good reason for the default way Xcode does it.

Background:
=============
I am working on an app that has required me to write my own versions of `NSNetService` and `NSNetServiceBrowser` to allow for Bonjour over Bluetooth in iOS 5. It has been a great adventure, as I knew nothing of network programming before I started this project.

My implementation is based largely on Apple's `DNSSDObjects` sample project. I have added code to actually make the connection between devices once a service has been resolved. An `NSInputStream` and an `NSOutputStream` are attained with `CFStreamCreatePairWithSocketToHost( ... )`.

Problem:
=============
I am trying to send some data over this connection. The data consists of an integer, a few `NSStrings` and an `NSData` object archived with `NSKeyedArchiver`. The size of the `NSData` is around 150kb so the size of the whole message is around 160kb. After sending the data over the connection I am getting the following exception when I try to unarchive...

    Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInvalidArgumentException', 
    reason: '*** -[NSKeyedUnarchiver initForReadingWithData:]: incomprehensible archive 
    
After further exploration I have noticed that the received data is only about 2kb.. The message is being truncated, thus rendering the archive ""incomprehensible.""

Potentially relevant code:
=============
The method that sends the data to all connected devices

    - (void) sendMessageToPeers:(MyMessage *)msg
    {
      NSEnumerator *e = [self.peers objectEnumerator];
      
      //MyMessage conforms to NSCoding, messageAsData getter calls encodeWithCoder:

However I would like to use the new JSON iOS5 api, which (as far as i know) just accept a NSData as input. So, I dont wanna convert my response from NSData to a NSString, and parse that using regex, and put that in another NSData object.

Can anyone see a better/cleaner solution for that Json parsing?

Suppose the output is:

    Shop A, G/F, 1/F-3/F, Lok Sing Building, 16 Kau Yuk Road
    Shop A, G/F, 1/F-3/F, Lok Sing Building, 16 Kau Yuk Road

But I got:

    Shop A, G/F, 1/F-3/F, Lok Sing Building, 16 Kau Yuk Road...

The `\n` not work on UITextView, anyone know how to make line break on UITextView?

I would expect to be able to use `initWithFrame`, and take the bounds from the passed-in `NSRect`, but if I examine the data in the debugger, I just get an `NSRect` instance with `(x=0, y=0), (width=0, height=0)`. Presumably it's not initialised yet?

More puzzling is that if I log the frame width to the console, I get the value twice:

    - (id)initWithFrame:(NSRect)frame
    {
        self = [super initWithFrame:frame];
        if (self) {
            CGFloat width = frame.size.width;
            NSLog(@""width: %f"", width);
        }
    }

This code logs:

    21/10/2011 09:40:55.733 Test App: width: 480.000000

It's as if initWithFrame is running in two separate threads and we have some kind of race condition. What's the correct way to get the frame width when the view is initialised?


",objective-c,osx,cocoa,graphics,,,open,0,214,12,"How do I get the dimensions of an NSView at init time? I have a custom view (`NSView` subclass), and I would like to store some data based on the dimensions (width/height) of the view when the view is instantiated, i.e. before `drawRect` gets called. 

I would expect to be able to use `initWithFrame`, and take the bounds from the passed-in `NSRect`, but if I examine the data in the debugger, I just get an `NSRect` instance with `(x=0, y=0), (width=0, height=0)`. Presumably it's not initialised yet?

More puzzling is that if I log the frame width to the console, I get the value twice:

    - (id)initWithFrame:(NSRect)frame
    {
        self = [super initWithFrame:frame];
        if (self) {
            CGFloat width = frame.size.width;
            NSLog(@""width: %f"", width);
        }
    }

However, my attempts have failed. I know the problem lies in the NSFetchedResultsController, but I just don't know why. When I try to run the app it fires the error 

    Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInvalidArgumentException', reason: '*** -[__NSArrayM insertObject:atIndex:]: object cannot be nil'

Here's my code for the super class and one of the view controllers. If anybody has any insights I'd be really grateful.

However, my attempts have failed. I know the problem lies in the NSFetchedResultsController, but I just don't know why. When I try to run the app it fires the error 

    Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInvalidArgumentException', reason: '*** -[__NSArrayM insertObject:atIndex:]: object cannot be nil'

Here's my code for the super class and one of the view controllers. If anybody has any insights I'd be really grateful.

What i want to verify is that if context.isValid is true, that doSomething is called on dest, but i don't know how to test that (or if that's even possible) using OCMock or any other traditional testing methods since that object is created entirely within the scope of the method.  Am i going about this the wrong way?  ",4

Basically, I am trying to understand when I need a new class. I am reading a book that covers the ""how-to"" really well, but not the ""why.""


I am building an application and I have the interface pretty much complete.

In other words, I have a lot of NSObjects floating around but, unfortunately, these objects don't know how to communicate with each other or with the underlying program. Here's the hypothetical.

I have several text fields that will eventually communicate their input to tables within my interface and also external PDF templates.

My basic understanding of Obj. C and Xcode is that in order for the text field to communicate it's contents to either the PDF file or the table, I will need to create a new class to specify the text field's contents as a variable, and to send that variable somewhere (PDF or table).

However, if I have a button that will ultimately be responsible for sending the textfield's data somewhere, I will also need to make a connection between the button and the text field, like this.

(button) --- fetches ---> (text field contents) ---sends to ---> (table)

So, up this point, I would be including all of this in one class, right? With the text field input as a variable that I declare in my header file, the button's method/action which I include in the header file and implement in the .m file, and the table which would also be declared in both .h. and .m files?

Am I on the right track? Also, this is just one connection from one text field. If I decided to this with more text fields in the application, would I have to create a separate class for each? Or could I use the same class and distinguish them by id's?

Here is the situation: My application has a `UIViewController` subclass called `InitialViewController`. This view controller has a UIButton, and when that button is pressed it creates a `NSObject` subclass called `MyEngine`. Something like this:

    @interface InitialViewController : UIViewController <MyEngineDelegate>
    ...
    @end

    @implementation InitialViewController
    ...
    -(IBAction)pressedButton:(id)sender {
        MyEngine *engine = [[MyEngine alloc] init];
        [engine start];
    }

Inside `start`, I present a ViewController (`ConflictViewController`) modally to get the user's choice:

    @interface MyEngine : NSObject <ConflictViewControllerDelegate>
    ...
    -(void) start;
    @end

    @implementation MyEngine
    ...
    -(void) start {
            ConflictViewcontroller *cvc = [[ConflictViewController alloc] initWithNibName:@""ConflictViewController"" bundle:nil];
            cvc.modalPresentationStyle = UIModalPresentationFormSheet;
            cvc.modalTransitionStyle = UIModalTransitionStyleFlipHorizontal;
            cvc.delegate = self;
            UIWindow *window = [(MyAppDelegate *) [[UIApplication sharedApplication] delegate] window];
            [[window rootViewController] presentModalViewController:cvc animated:YES];
    }
    @end


`ConflictViewController` is really simple. It just waits for the user to decide, and when the user press the button, it send the message to the `delegate`, and dismiss itself.

    -(IBAction)didSelectConflict:(id)sender {
        UISegmentedControl *seg = (UISegmentedControl*) sender;
        [self.delegate didResolveConflictChoice:seg.selectedSegmentIndex];
        [self dismissModalViewControllerAnimated:YES];
    }

I've checked every connection, all the delegates are working properly.
What is going wrong is:
When MyEngine receives the user's choice in it's implementation of `didResolveConflictChoice:` it cannot continue properly because all of it's properties have gone `null`.

When the `MyEngine` presents the `ConflictViewController`, the program continues the execution and when `start` finishes, it goes back to `pressedButton:` and when this method is closed, the `MyEngine` object gets released.

What i want to know is if there is way around this ? Has anyone done something like this in another way ? 
The question here is: How to get the user's choice properly when the choice is too complex to use `UIAlertView`.

Sorry for the long question, I simplified it as much as I could. Thanks for your time, any links, comments, or any kind of help is greatly appreciated

Unfortunately, I'm having performance problems as the path gets long (several hundred vertices) and it becomes impractical to draw the entire path every time the view is refreshed.

I tried splitting the path into many different segments which allows me to draw only the segments that are in the rectangle passed to me in `drawRect:` and that helps significantly, but drawing is still slow; many segments are redrawn unnecessarily when sections are added to the path in a region of the screen which already contains parts of the path.

I don't remove anything from the view, so I tried to enable `clearsContextBeforeDrawing` and only draw the latest segment each time `drawRect:` is called, but it seems there is a large amount of anecdotal evidence online suggesting that this property doesn't do anything and I also could not seem to make it work at all.

What is the best way to speed up drawing?

From what I've read, it looks like my best option is drawing to an (offscreen) bitmap context so I can add little by little and copying it to the graphics context being displayed on the screen, but I also read that this is often slow both in allocating the context and because of the RGBA to RGB conversion that is required in rendering the image to the screen.

It looks like I may be able to do something involving a `CALayer` (either with or without the offscreen buffer) – it's unclear to me how drawing on a layer works and whether it would circumvent any of the problems I've seen. The `contents` property accepts a `CGImageRef`; can I make a `CGImage` then update *it* incrementally without redrawing everything?

And hence if [_lockObject release] is called while _lockObject is held, bad things may happen.

What is the correct way to dispose of the lock in my dealloc method?

And it makes sense because I am passing a CV_8UC4 image. 

So I guessed I should create a cvmat with this characteristics. Right now I have these 2 methods. which allow me to get gray or color cvmats (CV_8UC1/CV_8UC4)

**For Color:**

    -(cv::Mat)CVMat
    {
        
        CGColorSpaceRef colorSpace = CGImageGetColorSpace(self.CGImage);
        CGFloat cols = self.size.width;
        CGFloat rows = self.size.height;

                                                        rows,                     // Height of bitmap
                                                        8,                          // Bits per component
                                                        cvMat.step[0],              // Bytes per row
                                                        colorSpace,                 // Colorspace
                                                        kCGImageAlphaNoneSkipLast |
                                                        kCGBitmapByteOrderDefault); // Bitmap info flags
        
        CGContextDrawImage(contextRef, CGRectMake(0, 0, cols, rows), self.CGImage);
        CGContextRelease(contextRef);
        
        return cvMat;
    }
    
    
**For Grayscale:**    
    
    -(cv::Mat)CVGrayscaleMat
    {
        CGColorSpaceRef colorSpace = CGColorSpaceCreateDeviceGray();
        CGFloat cols = self.size.width;
        CGFloat rows = self.size.height;
        
        cv::Mat cvMat = cv::Mat(rows, cols, CV_8UC1); // 8 bits per component, 1 channel
     
        CGContextRef contextRef = CGBitmapContextCreate(cvMat.data,                 // Pointer to backing data
                                                        cols,                      // Width of bitmap
                                                        rows,                     // Height of bitmap
                                                        8,                          // Bits per component
                                                        cvMat.step[0],              // Bytes per row
                                                        colorSpace,                 // Colorspace
                                                        kCGImageAlphaNone |
                                                        kCGBitmapByteOrderDefault); // Bitmap info flags
        
        CGContextDrawImage(contextRef, CGRectMake(0, 0, cols, rows), self.CGImage);
        CGContextRelease(contextRef);
        CGColorSpaceRelease(colorSpace);
        
        return cvMat;
    }

**And this is my guess to make it 3 channels:**

    -(cv::Mat)CVMat3Channels
    {
        
        //CGColorSpaceRef colorSpace = CGImageGetColorSpace(self.CGImage);
        CGColorSpaceRef colorSpace = CGColorSpaceCreateDeviceRGB();
        CGFloat cols = self.size.width;
        CGFloat rows = self.size.height;
        
        cv::Mat cvMat(rows, cols, CV_8UC3); // 8 bits per component, 3 channels
        
        CGContextRef contextRef = CGBitmapContextCreate(cvMat.data,                // Pointer to backing data
                                                        cols,                      // Width of bitmap
                                                        rows,                     // Height of bitmap
                                                        8,                          // Bits per component
                                                        cvMat.step[0],              // Bytes per row
                                                        colorSpace,                 // Colorspace
                                                        kCGImageAlphaNoneSkipLast |
                                                        kCGBitmapByteOrderDefault); // Bitmap info flags
        
        CGContextDrawImage(contextRef, CGRectMake(0, 0, cols, rows), self.CGImage);
        CGContextRelease(contextRef);
        CGColorSpaceRelease(colorSpace);
        
        return cvMat;
    }

But I get the following error:

    <Error>: CGBitmapContextCreate: invalid data bytes/row: should be 
             at least 9792 for 8 integer bits/component, 3 components, 
             kCGImageAlphaNoneSkipLast. 
    <Error>: CGContextDrawImage: invalid context 0x0

So my question is, What is the correct way of creating a 8UC3 compatible CGBitmapContext?
(I assume the 8UC3 means 8 bits per pixel with RGB channels)

Thank you.

But I get the following error:

    <Error>: CGBitmapContextCreate: invalid data bytes/row: should be 
             at least 9792 for 8 integer bits/component, 3 components, 
             kCGImageAlphaNoneSkipLast. 
    <Error>: CGContextDrawImage: invalid context 0x0

So my question is, What is the correct way of creating a 8UC3 compatible CGBitmapContext?
(I assume the 8UC3 means 8 bits per pixel with RGB channels)

Thank you.

I've managed to get a simple design going where there is are back/forward/reload buttons, the address bar itself, and a connect button (I have to figure out at another point how to modify the keyboard to have a ""Go"" button in place of the regular return.

My current problem is that my general purpose connect button's function looks like this:

    -(IBAction)connect:(id)sender
    {
        NSURL *url = [NSURL URLWithString:address.text]; //address is the address bar

    }

However, for some reason, the URL is only understood if it has 'http://' in front of it. Simply entering 'google.com' and touching the Connect button does nothing. I figure that this is either a latent issue with the NSURL class or UIWebView, but the API documentation isn't particularly helpful at times, and I simply cannot figure out which. I feel like automatically adding 'http://' to the front of the address bar's text property might be a poor idea, in case 'https://' would be needed instead (though on the other hand, a normal website often relays to a secure protocol, but this is not always the case).

I'm also having issues with the back and forward buttons in that they're not updating the address field's address. This is understandable as the address bar isn't directly tied to the WebView (perhaps there is a part of UIWebView that does this which I haven't come across?), and I haven't figured out a way to update the address bar to display the new URL. I've noted that there are UIWebViewDelegate methods which include things such as *webViewDidStartLoad*, but I'm not fully aware of how to utilize these things properly. I've tried using the *[webView isLoading]* boolean as a test, and then modify the address bar URL accordingly, but it seems to work to no avail, perhaps due to caching or something like that.

Pardon me if I haven't elaborated certain things well enough or if these questions have been answered on here already; I did a quick search and have looked around online a bit, only to fail at coming across any advice regarding what to do. As I said, Apple's API documentation, while extremely deep, is a bit awkward at times to use. If you have any more questions regarding what I'm aiming to do, I'll certainly try to answer as best I can.",5
