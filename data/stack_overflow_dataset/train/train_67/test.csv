His old site is an .asp based site and we're replacing it with a WordPress site on LAMP hosting. The old site sits on domain A and also has another domain, domain B parked on top of it mirroring it. 

Google has picked up domain B for most of his search engine results and yahoo and bing etc have picked up domain A.

The plan is to 301 redirect the the old pages of his site on domain A to the new WordPress versions and park domain B on top of it like before. My question is, will this work, if not what would be a better way to approach it?

We'd prefer not to lose any of the search engine listings in the redesign, and the search engines don't appear to have penalized him for duplicate content.
