Well I've been messing around with this problem for a bit and I did find out that it was the .htaccess file that was causing me not to be able to login.  

I found out if I comment the canonical part out in the .htaccess file, my website allows me to login and see the working mod just fine but I get ""http://phone7forum.com/"" instead of what I want which is ""http://www.phone7forum.com/ :

I definitely want the ""http://www."" since its the best method and holds the best weight.. But when I un-comment it, it will not allow me to login as the admin nor any user... Is there anything I can do to fix this matter???

I'd like to add, before I found this website I installed the Mod ""Canonical URL"" found here:

Possibly this might be part of my issue?  Maybe I should go undo everything that Mod told me to do and then try un-commenting the canonical section in the .htaccess file?

Now, what i need is for this to keep working, but i also need to be able to redirect a mapped domain to the same pages. I have it set up so that all the member has to do is to edit the CNAME for their domain and have it redirect to the sub-domain that was created when they registered. So for example, I would register **www.username.com** with a registrar and set its CNAME to **username.domain.com**, so if a browser was to visit **www.username.com** then they would see the same thing that would be there if they entered **username.domain.com**.

Again, the sub-domains work file with the code i have above, and that code also allows me to for the use of www in the URL, so i need that to keep working, while also allowing the mapped domains to work as-well.

The error looks like an issue with redirection or domain mapping,
but how could that be turned on or off by the file extension?

The hosting provider at first tried to tell me I don't know how to write HTML, but when I mentioned I've been in software for thirty years and web work for several, he put me on hold to find someone that actually knows something.  Eventually they came back and said it's MY fault for not having the correct stuff in .htaccess  

Setting aside the obvious retort about it being the hosting provider's job to put the correct stuff in httpd.conf, I made a couple of attempts.  But 99% of my web work has been content in HTML/PHP/perl and I know nearly nothing about .htaccess

Everything works great, including response time and all 10 instances (various domains), but 3-4 times a day: http://test.web.com does not give any response, it throws blank page (completely blank) while at the time when its blank, direct url: http://127.0.0.1:8080/demo works fine. It means tomcat still works fine, it seems apache is not able to forward the request to tomcat - right now load on per instance is 20 per minute.

    /staging/**anothernewproject**/  
    /staging/**anothernewproject**/current/ **<-- this is a symlink to the latest release**  
    .... and so on


Each of the project folder has its own .htaccess thing going on, it could be a magento, wordpress, cakephp etc installation which has been deployed by capistrano.

I want it so if i go to: http://newproject.staging.mydomain.com/ it is re-written to show the content in that folders ""current"" directory for example;

http://newproject.staging.mydomain.com/ would show /staging/newproject/current/ and  
http://anothernewproject.staging.mydomain.com/products would show /staging/anothernewproject/current/

Here is what i have tried already;

    RewriteEngine on
    Options +FollowSymLinks
    RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^([\w-]+)\.staging\.mydomain\.com$
    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ %1/current/$1 [LAST,QSA]

Which kind of works but not as i would like, if i go to http://newproject.staging.mydomain.com/ i get redirected to http://newproject.staging.mydomain.com/newproject/current/

If i click to go through to a page i get http://newproject.staging.mydomain.com/newproject/current/index.php/about-magento-demo-store
whereas what i want ideally is just http://newproject.staging.mydomain.com/index.php/about-magento-demo-store

Not sure if it is relevant but i am on a Media Temple dedicated virtual 4.0 box.

Could any one offer any tips on how to solve this? thanks in advance!

I tried javascript rewrite but it reloads the page
Like this:
   
    window.location.href = ""/index.html?page=home""

My page already takes the arguments and follow a javascript function, but I would like to just simply add something to the current URL in the bar, without reloading or doing anything else.

Any ideas?

Perhaps someday I will make it freely accessible, but now I'm only planning to use it on my hobby site. At this stage I need some advice on how to set up the URLs, for files that receive both GET and POST requests.

Suppose one of my files is called `function_A.py` and used in this fashion:

    www.example.com/api/function_A.py?a=something&k=other+thing


My question is, how does one set up 'pretty' URLs in an API?

I see most APIs have a typical URL format like `http://www.example.com/api/read` instead of `http://www.example.com/api/read.py`

Is this some .htaccess magic, or have they set up the actual file as 
    `http://www.example.com/api/read/index.py` ...
