But since the question is more about the concept of networking rather than it's implementation in a specific hardware, I decided to post it here.

As per my understanding Route Targets are used in MPLS-VPNs to distinguish between the different VRFs in a PE router.     

Assuming that no site is shared between any two VPNs, then the export and import route targets are the same, so a PE can compare the route target in an incoming BGP packet to it's own export route target and install in the appropriate VRF.

My doubt is, how is this allotment of route targets handled when there are sites that belong to more than one VPN?  

Are the route targets to various VRFs manually installed in all the PEs?  

If so won't it lead to scalability issues?  

If not, how are the route targets for the VRFs installed?",networking,vpn,bgp,,,06/02/2012 20:22:18,off topic,1,163,8,"How are Route Targets assigned in overlapping MPLS-VPNs?

Is a ‘distributed internet’ one thing or many things (one internet or many internets?)

Should the focus be on Hardware or Software? Is this a linked system of interoperable parts?

Could we make more progress by building of existing telecommunications infrastructure, or should we start from the ground up?

What about hybrid architectures, with mesh networks, and community owned trunks?

Some more technical questions of my own:
Could we use Shortwave, UHF, or VHF radio links for information backhaul?

Could we use tunnelling within the current infrastructure, as implement in the FreeNet software?

Can we hack diaspora* or similar software to create a killer app for a distributed network?

How important is the idea of federation? Does federation lead directly back to centralization of control structures?

Some geopolitical questions from Venessa:
What are political, economic, and technological motivations for such an endeavour?

Are distributed systems more efficient?

An engineer was able to identify the issue with your VPS and restore connectivity earlier today. When attempting to run the ifup command to bring up the network interface on your VPS the following error occurred:

'ifup: failed to open statefile /var/run/network/ifstate: No such file or directory'

Thus it would appear that when your VPS was rebooted on Sunday morning, following a power bar failure that affected some of our services, the external network interface within your VPS could not be brought back up. Our engineer resolved this temporarily by running the command mkdir /var/run/network and then restarting the networking wtih /etc/init.d/networking restart.

Our engineer then tested to see if this problem with the /var/run/network folder lies within the Ubuntu 11.04 x86_64 template itself and could confirm that this was not the case, so whilst the unexpected reboot was due to a problem at our end, the fact that your network interface did not come back up is not, but must rather be due to a configuration change or software installation/update that has been made within your VPS. We would recommend you search on-line for a permanent resolution to this issue or you will experience this again when you next reboot your VPS.

I can see BPDUs being sent and received in appropriate locations however there seems to be a problem with failing over to the secondary link when the primary goes down in a certain way. 

Operating normally the non-root switch (on the right) blocks its link to the 881, getting rid of the loop. When the link between the switch and the 2911 is broken STP unblocks the port and traffic between the two sites flows normally. 

However, when the link between the two 2911's is broken STP cannot seem to switch over to the other link and traffic stops transmitting between the 2 sites.

Basically, there's a ball and 2 or more players. What I wanted to do is:

The physics is completely simulated on the server. The clients send their inputs to the server and the server sends the position (only the position and rotation that's it) to the clients. The clients than set the position of the objects to the given position datas.
The ball is also simulated on the server. 

Problem: There can be a high latency and the gameplay would be not smooth on the client side. The players can freely move around and interact with the ball (just pusing it and such things).

I read about prediction but how should it be possible to guess the movement of the player? The player can move completely free (360°).
I also read about Servertime and clienttime but I didn't get it very well :/

How could I reduce lag? Please explain your solution because I don't want to just copy and paste it, I want to understand it.

PS: Probably I will have very low ping (1-5 ms) on wifi (local, both devices on the same network), I guess but I want to implement Gamecenter too and than I would need to handle the lag.

When downloading a file from amazon s3 (and only amazon s3- every other site works fine) some percentage of the time the connections dies.   This only happens from our servers in Seattle with a Web Server behind a nat router.  Connecting directly from the router works fine. From our servers here in Victoria everything works fine and we can't replicate this at all.


Web Server Seattle (tried 10 different servers) ->  snat router (2 different routers; old kernels and new kernels) -> amazonS3 =  doesn't work ~10% of the time
Web Server Seattle  ->  snat router -> any other website =  works
Router box -> amazonS3 =  works
Web Server Victoria -> snat router Victoria -> amazonS3 = works


Things I've tried:
Disabling window scaling
Lowering the window size
upgrading the router to the newest kernel
Disabling the firewall entirely

In the failure case Amazon (or something along the way) sends us a 868 length packet instead of the expect 1500 byte packet.  The server upon seeing the packets replies with a RST packet (error has occurred) and the connection is torn down.

Any help would be greatly appreciated!

What we want to do is connect a router at our office to their head office site via VPN.

Once we have done this, should we have access to all of the other sites connected to the head office?

We've managed to get the VPN connected, but at present can only seem to ping/connect to head office's router and computers.

Once we have done this, should we have access to all of the other sites connected to the head office?

We've managed to get the VPN connected, but at present can only seem to ping/connect to head office's router and computers.

Let's take for instance a typical P2P network - Torrents, every torrent client has the option of looking at who's sending you a particular file, get his IP, client version etc - which could easily identify who's the actual person on the other side of the wire, by tracing his ISP's log and checking who was leasing a particular IP address at a certain time.

![P2P client's IP address available when using torrents.][1]


Now, this cannot be prevented because of the very nature of the IP protocol and that TCP needs the info in the IP (sender's address) so that i knows who to ask to resend data when it detects corrupted, missing or otherwise invalid packets.

If we'd look closely at the data packet's anatomy, we could find that:

![Network protocol layers][2]

The sender's identity is carried only on the second layer - the IP layer. 
The sender's physical address get's replaced after the first hop the packet has to go through on it's way to the destination - the first encountered router.

This means that if we'd stop sending the sender's IP address in the IP layer and instead changed a bit the TCP protocol in a way that it will generate a report after it get's the last packet (or the packet it thinks is last) and that report would be pushed to a centralized public server that would be responsible for publishing kind of a list that will say for instance that:

 - Recipient X has successfully got N packages with valid checksums. Or
 - Recipient X has received N packets. Packet 3, 4 and 8 have invalid checksums - please resend.

And that publicly available server would be queried by the sender after sending a bunch of packets to see if needs to resend anything or poll for a confirmation. In case the sender would find his recipient on that published list - it will resend the attached packets. 

With this method, nobody - even the ISP would know who is the real sender, as the info is not in the data packet, unless the very first router on ISP's side will audit every single packet it routes.

Going further - we could also send an invalid MAC-address in the packet and have this one-way communication between the peers and use regular tcp/ip - maybe simple http, for status reporting and validation. Here, even the ISP won't know for sure who's the sender.

With this method, for sure there are going to be tangible performance and speed losses and the status server would be a single-point of failure. But this method could be improved upon to solve these issues.

![Sample p2p session][3]


Is there any existing protocol/method similar to what I've just described that I'm not aware of? If not - is there any flaw in my reasoning that would fundamentally fail this whole approach? If not - I'm more than happy to start prototyping and even developing this as an open-source project!

__Setup:__

I am using an ubuntu server as gateway between the two networks 

 - **network1:** 11.49.X.X Subn: 255.255.240.0
 - **network2:** 10.48.0.X Subn: 255.255.255.0
 - The license server is located at 11.49.14.213 (netw1)

The gateway has two network cards installed:
**eth0:** 11.49.9.250 [netw1] & **eth1:** 10.48.0.1 [netw2]
and is working as DHCP server for network2.

To realize the port forwarding I use iptables with following commands:

    #iptables –t nat –A PREROUTING –p tcp –i eth1 –d 10.48.0.1 --dport 1947 –j DNAT --to 11.49.14.213

    #iptables -A FORWARD -p tcp -i eth1 -o eth0 --dport 1947 -j ACCEPT
note: I changed the default policys to ACCEPT - so there should be no need to fiddle around with the filter rules while testing. Also, I applied the previous rules as well for udp.

__The Problem:__

Just for testing purposes, I ran a web server on the license server as well (of course applied the upper rule with port 80 then) - this works! ... i also can access port 1947 via cmd and telnet from the clients. 

The problem is just the license server is not responding. 

__Are the rules correct? Do I need something else? like SNAT or is masquerading enough?__

An other aspect is that, before I started, I changed network2 from 192.168.0.X to the currently applied 10.48.0.X . Before I changed this the port forwarding worked!

I did the network change via /etc/network/interfaces to:

    auto eth1
    iface eth1 inet static
        address 10.48.0.1
        netmask 255.255.255.0

    12/01/02 10:02:11 INFO ipc.Client: Retrying connt to server master/192.162.10.10:9000. Already tried 0 time(s).
    12/01/02 10:02:12 INFO ipc.Client: Retrying connt to server master/192.162.10.10:9000. Already tried 1 time(s).
    12/01/02 10:02:13 INFO ipc.Client: Retrying connt to server master/192.162.10.10:9000. Already tried 2 time(s).
    ...

I'm saying it's similar, because I suspect this is a port availability issue. Running `telnet master 9000` reveals that the port is closed. I've read somewhere that this might be an IPv6 clash issue, and thus defined the following in conf/hadoop-env.sh:

    export HADOOP_OPTS=-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true

But that didn't do the trick. Running `netstat` on the master reveals something like this:

    Proto Recv-Q Send-Q  Local Address       Foreign Address      State
    tcp        0      0  localhost:9000      localhost:56387      ESTABLISHED
    tcp        0      0  localhost:56386     localhost:9000       TIME_WAIT
    tcp        0      0  localhost:56387     localhost:9000       ESTABLISHED
    tcp        0      0  localhost:56384     localhost:9000       TIME_WAIT
    tcp        0      0  localhost:56385     localhost:9000       TIME_WAIT
    tcp        0      0  localhost:56383     localhost:9000       TIME_WAIT

At this point I'm pretty sure the problem is with the port (9000), but I'm not sure what I missed as far as configuration goes. Any ideas? Thanks.
",networking,hadoop,port,hdfs,,,open,0,884,9,"Hadoop HDFS - Cannot connect to port on master I've set up a small Hadoop cluster for testing. Setup went fairly well with the NameNode (1 machine), SecondaryNameNode (1) and all DataNodes (3). The machines are named ""master"", ""secondary"" and ""data01"", ""data02"" and ""data03"". All DNS are properly set up, and passwordless SSH was configured from master/secondary to all machines and back. 

I formatted the cluster with `bin/hadoop namenode -format`, and then started all services using `bin/`tart-all.sh`. All processes on all nodes were checked to be up and running with `jps`. My basic configuration files look something like this:

    <!-- conf/core-site.xml -->
    <configuration>
      <property>
        <name>fs.default.name</name>
        <!-- 
          on the master it's localhost
          on the others it's the master's DNS
          (ping works from everywhere)
        -->
        <value>hdfs://localhost:9000</value>
      </property>
      <property>

I'm just trying to get HDFS running properly now.

I've created a dir for testing `hadoop fs -mkdir testing`, then tried to copy some files into it with `hadoop fs -copyFromLocal /tmp/*.txt testing`. This is when hadoop crashes, giving me more or less this:
