Here's the setup- We have internet traffic being sent in, then split between a router, a netgear prosafe FVG 318 (regular internet) and an edgewater SIP phone system. The netgear plugs into a 24 port POE switch which then serves the building.

Here's the problem- The network is insanely spotty. People are constantly loosing connection off the wireless, and I finally decided to assign everyone (including our SIP phones) static ip's, which seems to stabilize the connections some what. However, when attempting to use DHCP to connect, often users will not be able to authenticate and receive a valid IP address. This happens for both wired and wireless connections. The weird thing is that some times it works, and other times it does not. the DHCP is not allowed to assign ips in the ranges assigned for static ips. While monitoring the connection with ping -t, about every 20th result returns either unreachable or times out.

resetting the router/WAP seems to help these problems, but they come back quickly. At one time there were two DHCP servers running on the network, and I disabled the other server, and let the router serve the IPs.

Lastly, we just got in two WAP's to extend our wireless network to the far ends of the building, but I don't want to install them until I find out what is wrong with the rest of the network, or else I""ll just be making a bad situation worse.

Specifically, I am able to get an IP on the LAN, but I cannot ping anybody (cannot ping the computers on the LAN and cannot ping computers on the Internet).

I have disabled ufw, and set all the net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-* sysctl's to 0 (to prevent bridged traffic from being processed by iptables rules). I can't figure out why ICMP is being blocked here, and I've run out of leads.

### Setup Details ###

My /etc/network/interfaces bridge setup is very simple and looks like this:

    auto lo
        iface lo inet loopback

    auto br0
    iface br0 inet dhcp
        bridge_ports eth0
        bridge_stp on
        bridge_fd 0
        bridge_maxwait 0

In my virtual machine configuration file (which I access via virsh edit vmname), I specify bridged networking as follows:

      <interface type='bridge'>
          <mac address='52:54:00:c5:4e:81'/>
          <source bridge='br0'/>

",networking,ubuntu,virtualization,bridge,kvm,05/30/2012 23:42:39,off topic,1,258,11,"How to set up bridged networking for KVM using Ubuntu 12.04? On my Ubuntu 12.04 host system, I am trying to run a KVM (which also runs Ubuntu 12.04) with a bridged networking configuration, but it is not working. Specifically, I am able to get an IP on the LAN, but I cannot ping anybody (cannot ping the computers on the LAN and cannot ping computers on the Internet).

I have disabled ufw, and set all the net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-* sysctl's to 0 (to prevent bridged traffic from being processed by iptables rules). I can't figure out why ICMP is being blocked here, and I've run out of leads.

### Setup Details ###

My /etc/network/interfaces bridge setup is very simple and looks like this:

    auto lo
        iface lo inet loopback

    auto br0
    iface br0 inet dhcp
        bridge_ports eth0
        bridge_stp on
        bridge_fd 0
        bridge_maxwait 0

In my virtual machine configuration file (which I access via virsh edit vmname), I specify bridged networking as follows:

      <interface type='bridge'>
          <mac address='52:54:00:c5:4e:81'/>
          <source bridge='br0'/>

I have thought of a three possible scenarios, each having its own advantages and disadvantages and I would like to hear some opinion of those that either have implemented something similar already or have experience in multiplayer online games.

**1st Scenario:** Physics simulation on the clients: The player in turn to take a shot sends the angle of the shot and power to the server, and the sever updates all clients with these values so they can simulate the shot independently.

*Advantages:*

1. Low server overheat

*Disadvantages:*

1.	Problems with synchronization. Clients must simulate the exact simulation regardless of their frame rate. (Possible to solve with some clever algorithm like one described [here](http://gafferongames.com/game-physics/fix-your-timestep/))
2.	Cheating. Players can cheat by tweaking the physics engine. (Possible to determine when making a comparison at the end of the shot with other players ball positions. If only two players are at the table (i.e. not spectaculars) then who the cheater is?)

**2nd Scenario:** 

Physics simulation on one (i.e. “master”) client (e.g. who ever takes the shot) and then broadcast each physics step to everyone else.

*Advantages:*

1.	No problems with synchronization.

*Disadvantages:*

1.	Server overheat. Each time step the “master” client will be sending the coordinates of all balls to the server, and the server will have to broadcast them to everyone else in the room.
2.	Cheating by the “master” player is still possible.


**3rd Scenario:** The physics will be simulated on the server. 


*Advantage:*

1.	No possibility to cheat as the simulation is run independent of clients.
2.	No synchronization issues, one simulation means everyone will see the same result (event if not at the same time because of network lag)

*Disadvantages:*

1.	Huge server overload. Not only the server will have to calculate physics 30/60 times every second for every table (there might be 100 tables at the same time) but also will have to broadcast all the coordinates to everyone in the rooms.

Here are the network devises I have and a run down on what I’d like to do:
1) Server with 8GB RAM which I'd like to setup as a Windows 2008 r2 Domain Controller. I'd also like to host a Windows 2008 r2 Member Server in Hyper-V to run SQL2K8r2, SharePoint 2010 and CRM 2011. Note: CRM 2011 is actually the only piece of software that requires a full blown domain up and running in order to do development (can’t use local users and groups) 
2) Client Windows 7 Ultimate 64bit PC - Want to use as my Development PC
3) Client Windows 7 Ultimate 64Bit PC - Wife’s PC 
4) Sony PlayStation 3
5) NetGear all in one style router/ADSL model (DGND3300v2) 
6) Power over LAN connector

Pretty happy for everything to have to log onto the domain, if it has to; assume the PS3 won’t be able to log onto the network, but it would be nice if it could still get out to the internet 
Things that I’m a wee bit confused about:
1) Do I need to switch off the DHCP on the router so only the DC Windows DHCP assigns IP Addresses; do I have to do this, what headaches do I avoid if I switch the router DHCP off entirely? 
2) Should I setup DNS prior to running DCPromo
3) Do I need 2 physical NICs on the server?
4) What considerations/issues will I have when I run Hyper-V Virtual Network Management, is that going to stuff up my DCPromo on the host server. I need the hyper-v member server to be able to access the internet, one of the pain points I’m having at the moment.
5) Believe Windows 2008 r2 Firewall turns off everything by default, do I need to allow the standard ports for the network. I’ve a script that allows SQL Ports on the member server that works pretty well.
6) How do I get DNS forwarders to work in Windows 2008 DNS, I’ve tried this but whatever I do I can’t end up getting out to the internet in the host OS. 
7) Do I need to worry about the functional level of the domain?
