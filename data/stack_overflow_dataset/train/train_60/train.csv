Another example would be

client requests a project
server responds with ProjectDetails class which has project id, name, description, details AND a list of Activities (this is another class, so should be implemented as an ActivitiesCollection)

What do you think of this book http://www.amazon.com/Professional-WCF-Windows-Communication-Foundation/dp/0470563141/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1269425390&sr=8-5 ? 

And generally is there any source that would give me this all or the only way is practising, trying, looking in all that generated files and reading documentations?

Thank you.",2

I am encountering lag (resulting in a time out) when calling a domain service query.

**What am I doing ?**
I have a Silverlight 4 application. The app depends heavily on Domain services. 


**Replication**
Everything starts off fine. The app loads up and runs authentication against a domain service a-ok. I then can loads a collection of ""contacts"" from the ""contactsdomainservice"" without serious lag or hang ups.


The problem occurs when I run a query from the ""playersdomainservice"". This service is nearly *identical* to the ""contactsdomainservice"". It even uses the same Linq-2-sql data context. The silverlight sends out the request, however, the request does not reach the service until well after the client has already timed out. (the service executes perfectly btw).

**My question is. What is broken, and how can I debug this.**

**Fiddler 2**
When using fiddler i use localhost.:6000 (I add a period to the local host). When doing this **the problem goes away**.

**Wcf Trace**
Looking at the Wcf Trace logs, the player's request and responce apears with no anomolies. The request / responce execute in under 100ms.

That said, I do see some warnings in other requests. 

Configuration evaluation context not found.

Does any one knows the solution? What is the proper way to invoke a WCF method Dynamically if someone only knows the URI?
",wcf,class,proxy,dynamic,invoke,,open,0,3109,8,"Dynamically invoke WCF Service from its URI (http://ip:port/Service1.svc?WSDL) So here it is:

I am trying to invoke a WCF Service's method from with in a windows form client application. I do not have the Contract Class Definition. The only thing I have is the Service's URI, which is http://ip:port/Service1.svc. 

So I thought i could make a proxy class for that. I want to make the proxy class at run time so any external tool to create a proxy class and import to project can't help me.

I managed to make the proxy class on the fly. Here's the code:

            If (Not importer.State.TryGetValue(GetType(XsdDataContractImporter), dataContractImporter)) Then

                Console.WriteLine(""Couldn't find the XsdDataContractImporter! Adding custom importer."")
                xsdDCImporter = New XsdDataContractImporter()
                xsdDCImporter.Options = New ImportOptions()
                importer.State.Add(GetType(XsdDataContractImporter), xsdDCImporter)

            Else

                xsdDCImporter = TryCast(dataContractImporter, XsdDataContractImporter)
                If (xsdDCImporter.Options Is Nothing) Then

                    Console.WriteLine(""There were no ImportOptions on the importer."")

I'm now trying to add Basic authentication to the service. But I'm hitting some rather large roadblocks in the WCF stack which is preventing me from doing this.

It appears that the `HttpListener` (which self-hosted WCF services use internally at a low level in the WCF stack) is blocking my attempts to insert a `WWW-Authenticate` header on a self-generated 401 Unauthorized response. Why?

I can get the authentication working if I forget about this `WWW-Authenticate` header (which it seems Microsoft did as well). But that's the issue. If I don't send back a `WWW-Authenticate` header then the web browser won't display its standard ""logon"" dialog.

- minimize the size of messages on the wire
- encrypt messages on the wire so they can't be sniffed and read.
- be able to authenticate users with and without Windows authentication.
- Authorise callers using custom roles and permissions.
- pass extra metadata in the request message such as users machine name and a logging context guid.
- log plaintext request/response messages for tracing and maybe auditing.
- profile service operations for performance.

I can work it around if i will return IQueryable<ActionResponse> with only one item, but is looks ugly. Does anyone know any other way how to make $expand work for Service Operations which return a single entity?

when i try to $expand Action navigation property, i get the following error: 

        Query options $expand, $filter, $orderby, $inlinecount, $skip and $top cannot be applied to the requested resource

I can work it around if i will return IQueryable<ActionResponse> with only one item, but is looks ugly. Does anyone know any other way how to make $expand work for Service Operations which return a single entity?

Thanks in advance

We're doing a lot of stuff right: there's good communication; money for tools where appropriate; and we have brought on some good expertise to help us with the transition.

We're trying to develop standards that we can follow as a group, and one of the proposed standards is bothering me quite a bit:  

We have standardized on the pattern where every operation takes a request object and returns a response object.

I realize that this is more or less a standard approach for a lot of folks, but I am asking *why should I bother?* (I'm not so good with received wisdom, I need some why).

Most of the services that I will be providing are simple organizational metadata retrieval.  For example, find the security policy for a particular user.  This needs a user id and nothing else.  The standard tells me that I should wrap this request in an object and wrap the returned policy in a response object.

My unease is amplified by a look at the WSDL that is generated from our contracts.  WCF generates request and response messages automatically and wraps even the request/response object.

I fully understand that if you're making a complex request then a complex input object is warranted.  That's what you would do even if services wren't involved.

My question is why should I automatically wrap requests and responses when:

 - It makes simple services less expressive 
 - You would do it anyway for a complex service
 - WCF creates a request/response message anyway

I have found the following arguments in favor of this approach:

**It supports versioning by allowing optional parameters to be slipped into the request object.**  

Back in the day, I did a fair bit of COM, and I would consider this almost an anti-pattern for versioning.  For some things, I suppose it would help, but I expect that where it would help, you already have a parameter object anyway.

**It steers people away from an RPC style behavior and towards a messaging behavior**

I've read this on Microsoft's site and heard it from our guru, but I still don't have a clear idea what they mean or why it's valuable.  Is it that natural looking interfaces make people tend to forget that they are calling a remote service?

I'm thinking about changing the design so there is a new WCF connection for each joined room. In the actual app, the number of connections is likely going to be in the range of 10-100, possibly more.

Is this a good idea? Or are ~100 connections per client too much? The server should be able to handle many clients (range 100-1000, later up to 10k).

Executing a client against the service returns an error that the socket connection was aborted. Enabling tracing against the service reveals the following exception is thrown:

**System.ArgumentOutOfRangeException  
The value of this argument must be positive.  
Parameter name: maxAccepts  
Actual value was 0.**

I'm confused, because as best I can tell port sharing should be disabled by the configuration (see below), but it's still calling through the port sharing code (again, as best I can tell). In any case, I can't find any way to specify this maxAccepts value; Google doesn't know anything about it, and the maxPendingAccepts value doesn't seem to do it. How do I resolve the error?

The service's config file contains the following for the net.tcp endpoint:

    <bindings>
      <customBinding>

",wcf,net.tcp,,,,,open,0,655,6,"WCF Net.TCP service throwing obscure errors I am trying to enable an additional net.tcp endpoint (which uses Username authentication) for an existing WCF service. The service is hosted in IIS7. 

Executing a client against the service returns an error that the socket connection was aborted. Enabling tracing against the service reveals the following exception is thrown:

**System.ArgumentOutOfRangeException  
The value of this argument must be positive.  
Parameter name: maxAccepts  
Actual value was 0.**

I'm confused, because as best I can tell port sharing should be disabled by the configuration (see below), but it's still calling through the port sharing code (again, as best I can tell). In any case, I can't find any way to specify this maxAccepts value; Google doesn't know anything about it, and the maxPendingAccepts value doesn't seem to do it. How do I resolve the error?

The service's config file contains the following for the net.tcp endpoint:

Example: string params = ""ID:123;Name:Garry;Address:addressObject;AddressLine:108 Plaza Lane;City:Avenel;State:NJ;Zip:07001;"". Where ID and Name are simple string varaibles while Address is user defined type. What follows after Address i.e. AddressLine, City, State and Zip is elements of Address object.

I thought about hosting it in a worker role and using Queues storage for storing the requests from clients ... is this fine?

When someone publishes an event, I don't want to straight away send it to all the clients.

I want to be able to, for each client, check if that client needs to be notified about that publish.

Basically this will be done by accessing a database, and checking if that client has subscribed for that specific event with those parameters (cannot be done in advance, needs to be checked only against database).

Currently I am working using [this List-Based Publish-Subscriber](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms752254.aspx) sample, but it works in such a way - that when an event is published - client session is triggered separatly to send the message.

So for now, I am changing this :

     public void PriceChangeHandler(object sender, PriceChangeEventArgs e)
     {
         _callback.PriceChange(e.Item, e.Price, e.Change);
     }

     public void PriceChangeHandler(object sender, PriceChangeEventArgs e)
     {
         // Perform some database checks using BL if this client needs to be notified about this event

         // Only if answer is YES - call the callback function on that client

         _emailServer.SendEmail(e.Item);
         _smsServer.SendSMS(e.Item);
     }

**Two Questions :**

Is this the right way ? and how can I know what 'this' client is ? should the client send me credentials in the 'subscribe' method that I will store ?
Or should I implement a custom 'UsernameValidator' that will store the Principal ?

Anyone know of a technique to use in WCF?",4

We have used the UnitOfWork pattern to set up the ISession based on the following [example][1]:
We have implemented a ThreadStatic ISession as described in the example.

We have also used the IDispatchMessageInspector to start and stop the UnitOfWork : 

    public object AfterReceiveRequest(ref Message request, IClientChannel channel, InstanceContext instanceContext)
     {
         UnitOfWork.Start();
         return null;
     }
    
     public void BeforeSendReply(ref Message reply, object correlationState)
     {
         UnitOfWork.Current.Dispose();
     }


Our WCF services have been implemented as Singletons :

    [ServiceBehavior(InstanceContextMode = InstanceContextMode.Single, ConcurrencyMode = ConcurrencyMode.Multiple)]

The issue with this approach is that :
1) A UnitOfWork does not get started unless there is a WCF request received.
So if I need to implement some sort of a polling service , I have to manually start and stop the UnitOfWork

2) The ISession is ThreadStatic ..so yes it is ThreadSafe and since we are using the Singleton mode I do understand that it needs to be ThreadStatic.

   But lets say if I need to parallelize a large insert operation ..where I need to create say 300000 objects and persist them in a rally short time ..then I again need to start and stop the UnitOfWork inside by Parallel.For loop so that every thread gets its own ISession.
This works fine .. but I'm unable to wrap this call in a single transaction as each thread
works on a separate session

Had my ISession not been ThreadStatic , I could pass the same ISession to each thread and 
have transactional integrity implement on the entire parallel operation.  I do understand that its not a good idea to have multiple threads using the same session ..but in this case I'm doing a bulk insert ..so can it be justified ?

So the questions that I have are:

What other options do we have to setup NHibernate sessions in WCF Singleton services besides the UnitOfWork pattern . 

How do I maintain a transaction across a parallel operation ( when using NHibernate) ?

Each of these apps will be synced with WCF service. The app can ask for new data, download menus etc...

But the requirement is, that the apps must not be empty when first run on target device (there must be some data, like location etc.)

Here is how I imagine it would work - using MSBuild, it would download a list of all restaurants from the service and then for each of them (in a cycle) it would download the interesting data, feeding it into the application (say in a form of an XML file). Along with the XML file for each app, the build target would need to be different (name of the restaurant).

Can this be done in MSBuild? I have never worked with it before, so I will be glad for any pointers",wcf,msbuild,,,,,open,0,163,4,"Build project multiple times I have a project (a WP7 app), lets call it ""Restaurants"".

The service has a single Process method, which accepts a Request and returns a Response.

    // Messages contract
    public abstract class Request {}
    public abstract class Response {}

    // Operation contract
    Response[] Process(Request[] requests);

Personally I do not find it correct semantically and in cases where a collection of related requests are required to be processed at once (perhaps in a batch), would consider introducing BatchRequest and a BatchResponse messages.

Some people feel that accepting/returning arrays would allow us to not have the extra complexity of introducing batch requests (like the one illustrated above), and that you could send a single request in the array anyways.

PhoneService Service


You have created a service.

To test this service, you will need to create a client and use it to call the service. You can do this using the svcutil.exe tool from the command line with the following syntax:



svcutil.exe http://localhost:4444/Service/PhoneService?wsdl

This will generate a configuration file and a code file that contains the client class. Add the two files to your client application and use the generated client class to call the Service. For example:


C#

class Test
{
    static void Main()
    {
        PhoneServiceClient client = new PhoneServiceClient();

        // Use the 'client' variable to call operations on the service.

        // Always close the client.
        client.Close();

For a simple parent-child relationship, the solution is pretty simple with .NET 3.5SP1 or greater - the IsReference property of a DataContract ([this page][1] has a good explanation).

To get the grandparent <-> parent relationship working, I have IsReference set on the grandparent - no problem. But in order to get the parent <-> child relationship working, ""parent"" needs to be IsReference as well. As soon as I set that, my service fails - I imagine the problem is that the serializer doesn't know what to do when both the ""grandparent"" and ""parent"" are IsReference.

After a bit of research, I decided to use WCF in my application to do inter process communication, so I am using the NetNamedPipeBinding binding.

The ServiceHost hosting application is not a dedicated server, so it has to spawn the ServiceHost via a thread. So far so good.

So I have something like the following:

    Foo()
    {
        Thread serverThread = new Thread(new ThreadStart(ServerThread));
        serverThread.Start();
        Console.WriteLine(""Foo Exited"");
    }
    
    ServerThread()
    {
       Uri baseAddress = new Uri(""net.pipe://localhost/service"");
       ServiceHost serviceHost = new ServiceHost(typeof(MyService), baseAddress);
       ...
       serviceHost.Open();
       Console.WriteLine(""Server Thread Exited"");
    }

So as expected, I see:

    ->   Server Thread Exited
    ->   Foo Exited

But to my surprise, even though the thread the server is running on has excited, the client can still connect to the serviceHost and the service host processes the request properly!

So how come the ServiceHost is still processing and treating requests even though it's main thread (the one it was created on) is dead?

Also is there a better way to keep the ServerThread alive then a while(true){Thread. Sleep(100);}?

1) WCF client calls STS requesting a SAML token via a  RST/Issue request
2) STS responds with RSTRC/IssueFinal placing the SAML token into the response header
3) WCF client picks up the SAML token an makes call to business web service

STS and web service are hosted in a Java-based environment. 1) and 2) work fine, that is, I can see the STS responding in the expected manner with SOAP header and body correctly set.

Now, the problem is that after receiving the response from the STS the WCF client sends a request for a security context token to the business web service which of course fails and I don't know how and why.

The presenter includes calls to a wcf service.   Recently an error has croped up that is very trying.  Whenever I drag and drop one of these controls onto my design surface I am presented with an error that the endpoint with name ""yadda""  could not be found.  

This same behavior occurs if I try to run the usercontrol test container.    If however,  I comment out the intialization, add the control to my form, save the form, go to the control and uncomment the intialization, build, and then run my app evrything works fine.

Most of time we will use just .NET to .NET communication with usual binds and everything works fine since we are talking the same language. However, as you can see in the service contract declaration I have a WebInvoke attribute (and a webHttp binding) in order to be able to also talk JSON since one of our apps will be built for iPhone and this guy will talk JSON.

My problem is that whenever I throw a FaultException<DefaultFault> and have includeExceptionDetails=""false"" in the config file the calling client will get a generic HTTP error instead of my custom message. 

I understand that this is the correct behavior when includeExceptionDetails is turned off, but I think I saw some configuration a long time ago to allow some exceptions/faults to pass through the service boundaries.

It will need to support 500 concurrent sessions.(Singleton & Percall cannot be done because the Contract is Workflow based...Login...Function1,Function2,Logout..)  
I have 4 Servers each with a hardware capability of supporting 200 concurrent sessions.  
So I configured the service on One server as a Router(ServiceHost S = new ServiceHost(RouterService)) with hosting path such as ""http://myserver/MyService"".  I have set a simple load balancing mechanism and applied the Router table to redirect incoming requests to other three servers where the actual service copies are hosted...(""http://myserver/MyService1"",""http://myserver/MyService2"",""http://myserver/MyService3"")  

It is still not working...As soon as hits go above 200...communication error starts...I suppose because when 500 concurrent calls are made, then the Router(capability 200) is also required to stay connected to the Client along with the Actual Service Server...(in Session Call mode)..Is my thinking correct??


My question is...

  1) Is my approach correct or flawed from concept...Should I ask the Hardware team to set up NLB...  
  2) Should we redesign the contract specifically to ensure that the requests can somehow be made PerCall...  
  3) Someone suggested that such systems should be hosted on cloud (Windows Azure)...will need to look at costs involved...but is it correct...

In other words, instead of having clients directly contact a Perforce server, they will send and receive messages from a Web Service, which in turn will forward them to a Perforce server. This separation is done mostly for security reasons (i.e.: the clients should never have direct access to the Perforce server).

Another requirement is for the Web Service to be connected to an SQL Server Database. Following some research on ORMs, I came across NHibernate. It seems to have all the features that I would need in order to develop an efficient Web Service, such as caching and Lazy Loading.

I also discovered [Web Service Software Factory 2010][1], which according to Microsoft is ""an integrated collection of resources designed to help you quickly and consistently build Web services that adhere to well-known architecture and design patterns""

Here are my questions:

 1. I noticed that **Web Service Software Factory 2010** has not been updated since 2010. I'm hesitant to use it if the framework is not kept up-to-date or is deprecated. I also noticed that it does not provide TCP connections for Endpoints, which is one of the protocols I wanted to use to transfer the data between the Web Service and the clients. How adaptable is WSSF ? Can I overwrite some of the generated code ?

 2. Does WCF and NHibernate work well together ? Do you have any advice / suggestions to give regarding how to tackle both technologies together ? I'm mostly concerned as to how to create the Session Manager for NHibernate in a WCF environment.

 3. Since Performance is primordial for the Web Service, would you recommend that I use the TCP protocol instead of HTTP ? If I were to use TCP, is there any way in WCF to simply serialize the entities that I want to pass on the wire, instead of having them converted to the SOAP format first ?

As this is the first time that I use WCF and NHibernate, the cheer complexity of the task at hand is quite daunting. I have armed myself with some good tutorials for each service separately, but I haven't found one where all of them are working together.

I would really appreciate it if you had any suggestions / advice to offer following your own personal experience with the technologies.
