I'm confused on the Facebook and Yahoo side of the registration. The scenario is, upon clicking the Facebook/Yahoo registration links, users will be redirected to the provider's site for login, then redirect to our site with a form pre-filled with their email address and other profile data (photo/profile pic, birthday, gender, address, etc). With OpenId, as far as I know, you can't have access to most of those information since its concern is authentication. So, on the signup part, I'm thinking of using OAuth. 

However, I saw on Yahoo's registration for an API key (http://developer.yahoo.com/oauth/ or http://developer.yahoo.com/dashboard/createKey.html) that you can't access the user's email under Yahoo! Profiles. I need that email address to save on my accounts database.

Then, on sign in, I plan to use OpenID both for Facebook and Yahoo. Is that ok? Using OAuth for sign-up, and OpenID for login/sign-in? Or can I use OAuth for signing in?

I've recently decided to take on a project of making a social browser game. I have nothing large in mind at the moment, but in particular I want to experiment with making a facebook app for fun, that me and my friends can play (perhaps it gets more popular, but let me not get sidetracked).

Firstly, I would like to state that I feel I am above average at programming in general (I have developed a php/mysql website, made a rough 3d game engine in java, some embedded C programming, etc - to give an idea of the level of help I require). As stated, I know php and I can work with sql databases. My javascript is perhaps mediocre as I have not used it extensively, but I am learning and not finding it too difficult. I don't know flash at all, but it seems the trend is towards html5 and canvas.

**To-the-point-question:** What exactly is needed to to make a social game (for say, facebook). I would like to start with html5+javascript, mySQL database and php. However, I am not too sure how to integrate this into a game. My main concern is what tool to use for communication between client and server. Am I wrong in saying that all relevant calculations (for instance, for resources), are kept server-side as advanced users can possible hack?

Secondly, how would you send data between client and server (obviously posting and reloading the page won't work)? I have used ajax before, but I'm not sure if this is the route to go. 

I don't require an intricate answer (although I won't complain if I get one!). I'd be appreciative if someone can simply point me in the right direction. Thank you!

> **No new FBML applications** We will stop allowing new FBML applications, but will continue to support existing FBML tabs and applications. Instead, we recommend using IFrames.  
--Facebook Roadmap http://developers.facebook.com/roadmap

Now my application allows you to post your creation to another users wall (or a fan/group page). My old application used the FBML [fb:friend-selector][1] to allow the user to pick a friend, and it would grab the id of them, and post on their wall using FBJS [Facebook.streamPublish][2].

My question is, how do i go about doing the same thing in an iFrame? As far as i am aware, the only option i have is:

 - Use FBML in the iframe and have the js SDK turn it into an ugly, hard to access iframe (which also defies the point of sticking it all in a iframe in the 1st place, as it is going to be removed at somepoint?)
 - Create my own friend selector using graph api or something. Have yet to see a working example of that in action, makes me wonder if it is possible.

Are there any other options out there, or does anyone have a working custom friend selector in an iFrame?

Thanks in advance :)

To be consistent with the `iframe`, I use the same value for the `og:url` tag across the site (= the homepage URL), but that is perhaps wrong.

My question is, what am I missing that is preventing facebook from connecting to my rails development machine when I set the canvas render method to iframe?  Since my development log does not show any attempts of a connection, I'm guessing that it has something to do with the cross domain stuff, but I can't find a good answer about it anywhere.

At night when my process runs, I would reference the sessionKey and uid in order and update the user's status.

I am finding myself fumbling between whether or not my app should be a web or desktop app. Having both a web and desktop app would be confusing to my users, because they would have to grant/manage permissions for both apps.

the past days I tried hard to have facebook understand my website what it is - a representation of a hotel/bed and breakfast - i am running with the help of OG. I completely failed. i read a lot here about people having problems parsing their sites as og:type ""hotel"" or ""restaurant"". i really tried to understand the situation but i can't help it with a strategy. I read different documentations on the OG site itself - but there is no clear approach - i found contradicting documentations on facebook, too. i tried to come up with a solution offering to implement the complete metatags like

<meta property=""og:type"" content=""my_og_app:hotel"">

buts still that just messed it up more.

At the moment I go with that which constantly have my site parsed as og:type:website where i want to go for ""hotel"" plus adding the geo-lacation as seen below:

<!-- Metatags for Viral Marketing / Open Graph / facebook.com  -->

    ",facebook,parsing,graph,website,,,open,0,334,11,"Problems with parsing og:type seems unresolvable, please suggest a clear solution Dear fellow developers,

the past days I tried hard to have facebook understand my website what it is - a representation of a hotel/bed and breakfast - i am running with the help of OG. I completely failed. i read a lot here about people having problems parsing their sites as og:type ""hotel"" or ""restaurant"". i really tried to understand the situation but i can't help it with a strategy. I read different documentations on the OG site itself - but there is no clear approach - i found contradicting documentations on facebook, too. i tried to come up with a solution offering to implement the complete metatags like

<meta property=""og:type"" content=""my_og_app:hotel"">

buts still that just messed it up more.

At the moment I go with that which constantly have my site parsed as og:type:website where i want to go for ""hotel"" plus adding the geo-lacation as seen below:

I have been asked to analyse a potential Facebook application.

This application is a parental monitoring for kids accounts. Basically it will search a kid status message for specific keywords amongst others things. And this application will alert the parents when it finds something.

Of course this application will have a valid token to access the kid's data. This is not a tool to spy on the kid.

I am using the Graph API coupled with the 'since' keyword to get the last updates. It's working fine with a single user.

My question is about scalability. 
**How should I get updates of a huge number of kids to monitor?** (between 10,000 and 100,000 accounts) 

And for each kids I have to monitor status messages, videos, images, friend, friends' status messages...

Here are some numbers:

~2.1M requests each day to get hourly updates of 10,000 kids' account.

~57.8M requests each day to get hourly updates of 10,000 kids'account plus their friends', with an average of 40 friends each.

And as I read [here](http://www.facebook.com/help/?faq=210701362295828), it would be limited.

Nobody real is on my fake accounts friends list except me, and I have never used any of my fake accounts on groups, pages or anything other than helping myself with games.

I have had to set him up another one and he has lost all his friends and he'd played some games which he has lost the levels and points.  My husband is disabled and really enjoyed going onto FB.
And I don't think it's very fair that I have to stop playing TI because I am not allowed to have a few harmess fake accounts to help.  None of my real friends play TI and I'm not having a bunch of strangers on my FB who do play TI because I would rather have a few good friends then to have thousands of stranger or people I don't trust.
If I were to be forced to close my fakebooks accounts or they were all disabled, there's no way I could continue playing TI because I need items and energy more or less on a daily basis and I only have my fake accounts to help me.

I have had to set him up another one and he has lost all his friends and he'd played some games which he has lost the levels and points.  My husband is disabled and really enjoyed going onto FB.
And I don't think it's very fair that I have to stop playing TI because I am not allowed to have a few harmess fake accounts to help.  None of my real friends play TI and I'm not having a bunch of strangers on my FB who do play TI because I would rather have a few good friends then to have thousands of stranger or people I don't trust.
If I were to be forced to close my fakebooks accounts or they were all disabled, there's no way I could continue playing TI because I need items and energy more or less on a daily basis and I only have my fake accounts to help me.
Please don't take my game away from me because it's the only escape I have since I started suffering with depression.  I need TI when my kids aren't here.",2

**1-** Which hosting do you suggest? I have read about google-app-engine and Heroku, however I am not sure which one fits best for a free plan until it grows to a significant number of users. 
Heroku seems great for a beginner since they give you a sample code, but I am not sure about their databases and their scalability while being free. From [here][1] I understand that I have only 5 mb of databases for free which seems too little... right?. 
And one more thing: I'm assuming is possible to show photos from others users directly from facebook without hosting it

It is basically blank and I don't know what to do from here to figure out where the issue is.

Also not sure if the problem is with how I set up the facebook app or the PHP file not working properly or that the HTLM files are not being loaded.

I'm new so I have altered the links to not be hyperlinks but remove the space and they are all as is.

The problem does not occur if I use a different SSO like Yahoo, Live, etc.  Furthermore, other users ARE posting with Facebook and I see their comments.

So here is the situation -- I read an article on a site and decide I want to leave a comment.  The site wants me to authenticate with an SSO.  I choose Facebook as its the only option. It allows me to login, I grant whatever access is required and post a comment.  After I click post, the comment appears.  As long as I am logged into Facebook, I always see my comment (I am doubting that anyone besides me IS seeing the comment).  However, if I logout of Facebook and return to the site, my comment is not shown....that is until I login to my Facebook account -- then the comment magically appears.

I remember I had this same issue over a year ago on other sites and consequently had avoided FB SSO.  Today I encountered a site that only offered FB SSO and I used it having forgotten about the headaches... and important information that I posted hours ahead of time was not made publicly available because of this bug.  Consequently, many users ended up wasting a lot of time and money on something that could have been avoided had they been able to read my comment.

However, what seems to be lacking is a well-defined workflow from Facebook that explains how bugs are managed. Once a bug is submitted, it is usually triaged quite quickly, but often, a bug can then just end up in limbo and not change state for weeks.

Here's an example of a bug that I submitted: 

https://developers.facebook.com/bugs/255079837889099?browse=search_4f315bc0380012f57461728

This bug is assigned, no additional information has been requested from me, and nothing has been done with this bug since Dec. 19th. No responses ever come to my requests for updates on its status.

What I'd like to see is something that states:

1) Maximum time to expect updates on submitted bugs (triage)<br/>
2) Maximum time to expect updates on assigned bugs<br/>
3) Detailed explanation of each of the statuses in which a bug can be, and what that means for the bug's fix progress<br/>
4) Some sort of escalation system for bugs which do not appear to be getting updated.

Anyone from Facebook care to comment?

 - We can't get the Facebook access token from the user using the Javascript SDK. Instead we need to parse the cookie server side and if the cookie isn't set open up a new window with our website that has the Facebook JS SDK and then close it when the user is authenticated.

 - We can't open popups. Which we need to open up a signup/login dialog from our flash player that is needed when users haven't signed up to like videos

 - We can't see where the view is coming from. We only have an the referer-header set when loading the player.swf but except from that we can't see that the player is showed on Facebook. A good thing would be to have some more information, like which page/user has published the video. This is so that we can show our users from where they get their views.

 - We can't get the Facebook access token from the user using the Javascript SDK. Instead we need to parse the cookie server side and if the cookie isn't set open up a new window with our website that has the Facebook JS SDK and then close it when the user is authenticated.

 - We can't open popups. Which we need to open up a signup/login dialog from our flash player that is needed when users haven't signed up to like videos

 - We can't see where the view is coming from. We only have an the referer-header set when loading the player.swf but except from that we can't see that the player is showed on Facebook. A good thing would be to have some more information, like which page/user has published the video. This is so that we can show our users from where they get their views.

I have some logic when the user creates an event on my site that allows them to invite people by email and would like to also allow users to invite their Facebook friends (I got to the point where the user sees the list of her FB friends and selects them).

The problem I have right now is that I don't know how to notify the user friends on Facebook. These are the options that I thought of but I don't think any of them will work:

- **Send a private message to each user invited by the current user:** This is just not supported by Facebook (to prevent spammy apps I guess).
- **Show the send dialog (with Fb.ui) prepopulated with the list of users selected by the current user**: Currently the FB API supports only one user name in the prepopulated list.
- **Tag the invited users in the wall post of the activity:** I've tried this without success as they explain it here: http://digitizor.com/2011/01/24/tag-user-facebook-graph/ and http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3099183/tagging-a-user-in-a-wall-post-update-using-facebook-api and I see the documentation but there are no samples and I'm kind of lost.
- **Send a request of my app using FB.ui:** Apparently this is supported only for Canvas apps only and not for websites (https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/dialogs/requests/)
- **Send an email to the users' @facebook email address:** There is no way (that I know of) of knowing if a user allows external people to send them email messages to this address, plus the message by default show as plain text and I want an image to be displayed in the message body.

The only feasible option I see right now is using the FB.ui dialog as a second step in the event creation process in my site and having the user manually select her facebook friends in that dialog.

Does anyone have any previous experience with this? Any alternative that I am missing?

The app is verry simple and I have no problem with it. The problem comes when users try to publish in their walls. I want the posts to be something like:

I know that by doing something like:

    $parameters = array('message' => 'this is my message',
                        'name' => 'Name of the app',
                        'caption' => ""Caption of the Post"",

    $result = $facebook->api('/user_id/feed/', 'post', $parameters );

You can post on a wall, but that limits the app to one picture only and I want the users to be able to post two diferent picures.

Is here a way to publish a post like the one in the image?

Insight for both pages said for the period 16.12.11 - today:<br>

225	„Gefällt mir“-Schaltfläche<br>
49	„Gefällt mir“-Feld<br>
23	Nutzerprofil<br>

83	„Gefällt mir“-Feld<br>
9	Nutzerprofil<br>
1	Anfragen<br>
-453	Unbekannt (unknown)<br>


so what i see it that i GET new likes but in insight the total ""fan count increase"" is
reduced for exact 100% by source unknown resulting in a total of 0

does anybody have a similar behavior ?
or can anybody tell me why the source unknown is eating up all my new fans ? 
or what is the source unknown ?

I've run into a problem regarding privacy settings on Facebook. It's a difficult scenario but there surely must be a way to do this.

Here's the scenario :)

Goldilocks works for a big organisation and has friends from that organisation on Facebook. One of those friends is called Baby Bear who also works for the organisation. Baby Bear is friends with Supergrass who also works for the organisation. Goldilocks and Supergrass are not friends on Facebook.

Summary:

Goldilocks is friends with Baby Bear.
Baby Bear is friends with Supergrass.
Goldilocks is not friends with Supergrass.
Supergrass is a ""snitch"" and reports to Wicked Witch.

Goldilocks posts a message on her Facebook wall. Baby Bear replies to the wall post. Supergrass sees the message and reports it to the Wicked Witch. Goldilocks gets in trouble.

This is because even though Goldilocks and Supergrass are not friends, Supergrass sees the message as she is a friend of Baby Bear.

How can Facebook be set up to only allow wall posts by Goldilocks on her own wall along with Baby Bear's reply on Goldilocks' wall, to be seen by Goldilocks' friends only and nobody else. Friends of friends of Goldilocks (i.e Baby Bear's friends which are not Goldilock's friends) should never see the wall post or developing wall conversation started by Goldilocks. Is there a way?

And here's the original site: https://www.facebook.com/dpfa.schulen.leipzig

The reason is, that in the included CSS-file there is an instruction: max-width: 120px;
I found no possibility to overwrite this. Ok ;-)) that's the sense of frames!

I already know, that ""Facebook wants to maintain consistent formatting across Like boxes"". Also I've read on many sites, that I have to change to ""fb:fan ..."", i.e. the ""old style"". But that can not be the right way!!!

Has anybody any hint to solve this problem - maybe with javascript?

When you resize a picture with means of ""max-width"" you have to ensure, that the propotions of the picture will stay cooretly. Cropping would be hardly acceptible. Who will like a ""fun house mirror"" on his website?

I get the following error message:

Fatal error: Uncaught Exception: 102: Requires user session thrown in base_facebook.php line 1039

The only thing that appears to clear this message is clearing all of my cookies. Simply logging out and back in to facebook does not stop it. The frustrating thing is I that I am unable to repeat the error on demand which is making it hard to track down what is going on but from looking at that line on base_facebook.php it appears as though the exception was thrown because the access token is no longer vallid

How do I account for this? i.e. How can I check whether the access token is still valid or not and if not request/set a new one? I'm using the latest facebook PHP sdk v3 with codeigniter framework. 

There was a similar question but it related to the earlier version of the SDK so no longer valid.

",facebook,facebook-fql,facebook-php-sdk,,,,open,0,526,9,"Facebook query failing in PHP - access token problems I'm playing around with FQL with a facebook iframe app. I have just started getting an intermittent error recently when I attempt a simple FQL query such as get an array of the user's friends... I get the following error message:

Fatal error: Uncaught Exception: 102: Requires user session thrown in base_facebook.php line 1039

The only thing that appears to clear this message is clearing all of my cookies. Simply logging out and back in to facebook does not stop it. The frustrating thing is I that I am unable to repeat the error on demand which is making it hard to track down what is going on but from looking at that line on base_facebook.php it appears as though the exception was thrown because the access token is no longer vallid

How do I account for this? i.e. How can I check whether the access token is still valid or not and if not request/set a new one? I'm using the latest facebook PHP sdk v3 with codeigniter framework. 

There was a similar question but it related to the earlier version of the SDK so no longer valid. 

Any links to info/tips on how to debug/solutions etc. greatly appreciated as always!

Here's an outline of the code:

    public function index()
    {
        $this->load->library('facebook'); 

        // check if we can retrieve user id from facebook -    

        $user = $this->facebook->getUser();

        if (!$user) 

        { // if no user id there then redirect to Facebook login page 

        	 $this->loginByFacebook();   
        } 
        else // if we have id then we have a logged in FB user

When my server generates the content for the iframe, it checks for responses from Facebook indicating that the access-code has expired, and sets up the re-auth sequence to occur inside the iframe, where it will be the least noticeable to the user.   If, however, the server detects that the user is not logged in, it will bounce out to a new browser window to lead the user through sign-up.

Lately, I've noticed my iframe tends to go blank.  The issue appears to be that occasionally the Facebook APIs will report an access-code as expired when, in fact, the user is not even signed in.  Attempting to renew the access-code causes Facebook to redirect to the login page.   But the login page is served with 'X-Frame-Options:DENY' Header, so the browser just refuses to display anything in my iframe.  I don't have any control over this process once I invoke the URL to renew the access code, and since the content in the iframe is on a different domain, the hosting page can't even detect when this situation has happened.

Anybody know of a solution to this?  Ideally, the Facebook APIs would more accurately report on expired access tokens, but failing that, it would be nice if I could set the login page to be redirected to a new window.

When they buy something or post a comment they are already logged in and do not need to enter user data. the user data come from social networks or the profile documents I have in my application.

* Can this be done easily using a domino application? or is it faster to
build this using another platform?

* I do understand that I need to do some oAuth authentication to
connect with twitter and facebook, but how do I connect this data to

* If users choose to register with my site instead of logging in to twitter/fb, how would I go about authenticating those users, and do I use different authentication depending on if they login using Twitter or using my profile documents.

* can I oAuth enable my Domino application?
