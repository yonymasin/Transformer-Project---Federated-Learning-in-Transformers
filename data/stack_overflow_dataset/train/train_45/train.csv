When you change the sort radio button, the CollectionViewSource sorts properly, except that it changes selection, which (as a requirement) is bound to the underlying datapoint. Thus, sorting changes the state of the objects in the collection, which is bad.

What is a viable approach that prevents the selection from changing, and thus prevents the underlying object from changing?

I would prefer to use datagrid, except that you can't bind selection to an IsSelected property like I did with the listbox. If someone knew a way, that would be worth hearing too. I've asked about that [here][1] in more depth.

For many obvious reasons we have realized we have to move forward and a need has emerged for a replacement of our development platform, although we will keep using the Oracle database. A key requirement in every technology we have evaluated has been the capability of developing Rich Internet Applications, or at least traditional Web Applications, it must run on mobile devices such as the iPad, and must has support for the cloud. After an eliminating process we considered two options:

1. Oracle solution: The first option we considered was Oracle ADF, JDeveloper, Java and Oracle WebLogic Server. The principal disadvantage of this alternative was the licensing cost of WebLogic Server and the lack of a reporting tool within the IDE, plus a few other maybe subjective things about the IDE. A 100% Oracle solution would include BI Publisher as the Oracle official reporting tool, but the funds for its acquisition are unlikely to be approved. A 100% Java solution would include JasperReports for reporting, but still we consider the price we are going to pay to Oracle is too high for not including a reporting solution.

2. Microsoft solution: The second option we considered was Microsoft Silverlight, Visual Studio, C# and Internet Information Services. This alternative seems very attractive regarding the cost compared to Oracle WebLogic, but little research was necessary to find out that everyone seems to agree that Microsoft won’t launch any more releases of Silverlight after version 5 and I perceive a feeling of uncertainty about the future in the Microsoft developer community regarding Silverlight and the Windows 8 new approaches: Metro Style Apps, HTML5, etc. We are not advocating Windows Forms since I don’t see any future for this platform in the cloud era, and ASP.NET doesn’t seem to be suitable for large, complex enterprise applications needing to handle high volumes of data.

    </UserControl>


The image source isn't important, but you can verify that

* there is a picture of a kitten at that URL
* there a CrossDomain access file at http://farm3.static.flickr.com/crossdomain.xml

When I run the control, I don't get an image shown. So something is set up wrong despite my efforts. What has gone wrong?

But there is no debug output as there should be on a binding error, no exception thrown, no indication given of anything at all failing! Why is that?

Code much like this works fine in WPF. IF I include the image into the project, and do

    <Image Source=""kitten1.jpg"" />

That works fine. But it's not what I want.

I have received a few requests to automate some things our customer's tech does manually using our Silverlight application.

Example:
> When a new store is added automatically give the chain manager role
> access to the new stores.

We could implement this feature many ways, however, for our goals this item is low priority and needs more thought since
our app manages multiple tenants with different organization structures (different roles).
So, we don't plan to implement into our SaaS product today.



**Quick Implementation:**
Had we exposed a webhook for StoreAdded and provided a client library to our customers
we could enable the customer or ourselves to build an external project to provide this functionality 
without adding this feature into our core product.

Being a Silverlight project we could expose the authenticationservice and our existing services that have RequiresAuthentication, RequiresRole attribute already applied.
The client library would need to authenticate as a user with correct assigned permissions to then call the InsertUser_Store action.



**Questions:**


How would you handle this out of band feature differently?

I've got a collection of objects which I want to draw on a canvas.  Each of these object has a DateTime property, which determines the position of that object along the x-axis on the canvas.  Each object also has some other properties which determine the image that need to be drawn on the canvas.  The most important feature that I want to implement is that as time passes by the second, these images representing the objects would move along the x-axis.  In other words, the right vertical boundary of the canvas would always represent the current time (e.g. DateTime.Now), and objects in the collection would need to update their position on the canvas relative to that boundary.  I am very new to Silverlight and hence I have quite a few questions including the following.  In addition, I also have the requirement to follow the MVVM framework.

**Questions**

What should I use in the XAML to achive the above?  I thought about using ItemsControl with Canvas as the Panel, but I am not sure how to do it or even whether it is the best way.  Any actual XAML code would be great.

How should I bind the collection of objects to the canvas?  And if so, how do I move them along the x-axis as time passes?  That is, I would like the canvas to update whenever:

 - there are objects added to the
   collection; or
 - objects removed from the collection;
   or
 - existing object changing (e.g. some
   property changed and hence need to
   change the image that get shown on
   the canvas) in the collection; or
 - even if there are no changes to the
   collection as mentioned above, these
   objects will need to move every
   second.

As the run time view model context is not available when we load the control for preview - after loading the Element, the idea is to grab the binding information, create a type with those propertes at run time, to assign the same as the data context of the loaded control. 

We'll be using AssemblyBuilder/ModuleBuilder/TypeBuilder to build a type at run time. Having said that, we need to walk the visual tree to identify the bindings involved, to create a list of binding paths.

I'm a novice programmer, I've tried solving this on my own for days but have now completely run out of ideas/blog posts/walkthroughs and other sources.  I really appreciate your time in reading and potentially replying.

I am trying to integrate scoreloop into a game I'm developing but am getting some very strange results with data binding and a stackpanel. My tests (below) imply that there has to be something I'm doing wrong with bindings, but the crazy thing is it actually works the first time I use it. Here is the important code I'm using:

XAML:

    <ListBox x:Name=""LeftListBox"" Margin=""12,48,0,128"" ItemsSource=""{Binding}"" Background=""{x:Null}"" HorizontalAlignment=""Left"" Width=""240"">
                <ListBox.ItemTemplate>
                    <DataTemplate>
                    	<StackPanel Margin=""0,0,0,17"">
                    		<StackPanel Margin=""0,0,0,0"" Orientation=""Horizontal"" HorizontalAlignment=""Left"">
                    			<TextBlock Text=""{Binding Rank}"" TextWrapping=""NoWrap""  />
                    			<TextBlock Text=""."" Width=""54""/>
                    			<TextBlock Text=""{Binding Result}"" TextWrapping=""NoWrap"" Width=""76""/>
                    			<TextBlock Text=""{Binding User.Login}"" TextWrapping=""NoWrap""/>
                    		</StackPanel>                    		
                    	</StackPanel>
                    </DataTemplate>
                </ListBox.ItemTemplate>            	
            </ListBox>

    
If they beat a level I create a scorescontroller object(if needed) and pull down the scores

    CreateScoresControllerIfNeeded();
    if (!App._scoresController.IsProcessing)
                                            {
                                                App._scoresController.LoadScores(App._scoresController.GlobalSearchList, new Range(0, 10), 0);
                                            }

Method that creates the scorescontroller and registers events:

    void CreateScoresControllerIfNeeded()
        {
            if (App._scoresController == null)
            {
                App._scoresController = App.slClient.CreateScoresController();
                App._scoresController.RequestFailed += ScoresController_RequestFailed;
                App._scoresController.RequestCancelled += ScoresController_RequestFailed;
                App._scoresController.ScoresLoaded += ScoresController_ScoresLoaded;
            }
        }

The ScoresLoaded Event:

    void ScoresController_ScoresLoaded(object sender, RequestControllerEventArgs<IScoresController> e)
        {
            LeftListBox.DataContext = App._scoresController.Scores;
            Debug.WriteLine(""Scores Loaded"");            
        }

App._scoresController.Scores contains User.Login, Rank, and Result, and the extremely frustrating/confusing thing to me is it actually works, but only the first time I pull down scores.

After I beat a level it pulls down scores and displays them int he listbox just like I expect.  As soon as it goes through the same cycle for the next level though the listbox is blank.  The debug line of ""Scores Loaded"" always gets logged, everytime it does a scores download cycle.

What I've done so far in testing:

 1. Turned on ALL for bindings logging and could not see anything getting logged in the output.
 2. Set a break point at the Debug ""Scores Loaded"" line and can see that everytime it hits there it correctly assigned the datacontext,
    with the correct fields with exactly matching names
 3. Tried using Dispatcher.BeginInvoke(LoadScores); to be sure I was doing it off the UI thread in case this was somehow a threading
    issue
 4. Set the background color on the stackpanel to a color that I could use to ensure it wasn't being collapsed or hidden by another control
    or a storyboard animation
 5. Created a copy of the same stackpanel, set stackpanel.datacontext = this in the same LoadScores() method, then set up local variables
    for it to bind to.  Found that this exhibited the same behavior,

Thanks in advance for your time.",silverlight,data-binding,xna,scoreloop,,,open,0,1108,10,"Silverlight/XNA Hybrid Game Data Binding Irregularity with Stackpanel and Scoreloop I have to preface this with a disclaimer.  I'm a novice programmer, I've tried solving this on my own for days but have now completely run out of ideas/blog posts/walkthroughs and other sources.  I really appreciate your time in reading and potentially replying.

I am trying to integrate scoreloop into a game I'm developing but am getting some very strange results with data binding and a stackpanel. My tests (below) imply that there has to be something I'm doing wrong with bindings, but the crazy thing is it actually works the first time I use it. Here is the important code I'm using:

XAML:

    <ListBox x:Name=""LeftListBox"" Margin=""12,48,0,128"" ItemsSource=""{Binding}"" Background=""{x:Null}"" HorizontalAlignment=""Left"" Width=""240"">
                <ListBox.ItemTemplate>
                    <DataTemplate>
                    	<StackPanel Margin=""0,0,0,17"">
                    		<StackPanel Margin=""0,0,0,0"" Orientation=""Horizontal"" HorizontalAlignment=""Left"">
                    			<TextBlock Text=""{Binding Rank}"" TextWrapping=""NoWrap""  />
                    			<TextBlock Text=""."" Width=""54""/>
                    			<TextBlock Text=""{Binding Result}"" TextWrapping=""NoWrap"" Width=""76""/>
                    			<TextBlock Text=""{Binding User.Login}"" TextWrapping=""NoWrap""/>
                    		</StackPanel>                    		
                    	</StackPanel>
                    </DataTemplate>
                </ListBox.ItemTemplate>            	
            </ListBox>

    
If they beat a level I create a scorescontroller object(if needed) and pull down the scores

    CreateScoresControllerIfNeeded();
    if (!App._scoresController.IsProcessing)
                                            {
                                                App._scoresController.LoadScores(App._scoresController.GlobalSearchList, new Range(0, 10), 0);
                                            }

Method that creates the scorescontroller and registers events:

    void CreateScoresControllerIfNeeded()
        {
            if (App._scoresController == null)
            {
                App._scoresController = App.slClient.CreateScoresController();
                App._scoresController.RequestFailed += ScoresController_RequestFailed;
                App._scoresController.RequestCancelled += ScoresController_RequestFailed;
                App._scoresController.ScoresLoaded += ScoresController_ScoresLoaded;
            }
        }

The ScoresLoaded Event:

    void ScoresController_ScoresLoaded(object sender, RequestControllerEventArgs<IScoresController> e)
        {
            LeftListBox.DataContext = App._scoresController.Scores;
            Debug.WriteLine(""Scores Loaded"");            
        }

App._scoresController.Scores contains User.Login, Rank, and Result, and the extremely frustrating/confusing thing to me is it actually works, but only the first time I pull down scores.

After I beat a level it pulls down scores and displays them int he listbox just like I expect.  As soon as it goes through the same cycle for the next level though the listbox is blank.  The debug line of ""Scores Loaded"" always gets logged, everytime it does a scores download cycle.

What I've done so far in testing:

 1. Turned on ALL for bindings logging and could not see anything getting logged in the output.
 2. Set a break point at the Debug ""Scores Loaded"" line and can see that everytime it hits there it correctly assigned the datacontext,
    with the correct fields with exactly matching names
 3. Tried using Dispatcher.BeginInvoke(LoadScores); to be sure I was doing it off the UI thread in case this was somehow a threading
    issue
 4. Set the background color on the stackpanel to a color that I could use to ensure it wasn't being collapsed or hidden by another control
    or a storyboard animation
 5. Created a copy of the same stackpanel, set stackpanel.datacontext = this in the same LoadScores() method, then set up local variables
    for it to bind to.  Found that this exhibited the same behavior,
    disappearing on the second time I go to set the datacontext
 6. Created a copy of the stackpanel and removed all bindings, setting the three text fields manually.  This would not disappear, but
    showed up every time I beat a level

I feel like I've got to be doing something painfully stupid/obvious, but I'm a novice programmer, just picking pieces up as I have a need, and this is my first venture into the world of data binding.

So in the data template of the items control I want to create a NoteControl (user control for displaying a note) and bind its ViewModel property to the NoteViewModel in the collection.

I currently have this:

        <ItemsControl x:Name=""itemsControl1"" Grid.Row=""1"" ItemsSource=""{Binding Notes}"" >
            <ItemsControl.Template>
                <ControlTemplate TargetType=""ItemsControl"">

Every ""Page"" in Silverlight is technically a UserControl (they are derived from the UserControl class).  When I say UserControl here, I mean a Custom UserControl that will be used inside many different pages in many different scenarios (similar to an ASP.NET UserControl).

I would like the Custom UserControl to support Binding and not rely on the Name of the Property it is binding to, to always be the same.  Instead, I would like the UserControl itself to have a property that the Controls inside the UserControl bind to, and the ViewModels outside the UserControl also bind to.  (please see the example below)

Binding within the UserControl works, Binding within the MainPage works, The Binding I set up between the MainPage and the UserControl does not work.  Specifically this line:

    <myUserControls:MyCustomUserControl x:Name=""MyCustomControl2"" SelectedText=""{Binding MainPageSelectedText, Mode=TwoWay}"" Width=""200"" Height=""50"" />

Every ""Page"" in Silverlight is technically a UserControl (they are derived from the UserControl class).  When I say UserControl here, I mean a Custom UserControl that will be used inside many different pages in many different scenarios (similar to an ASP.NET UserControl).

I would like the Custom UserControl to support Binding and not rely on the Name of the Property it is binding to, to always be the same.  Instead, I would like the UserControl itself to have a property that the Controls inside the UserControl bind to, and the ViewModels outside the UserControl also bind to.  (please see the example below)

Binding within the UserControl works, Binding within the MainPage works, The Binding I set up between the MainPage and the UserControl does not work.  Specifically this line:

    <myUserControls:MyCustomUserControl x:Name=""MyCustomControl2"" SelectedText=""{Binding MainPageSelectedText, Mode=TwoWay}"" Width=""200"" Height=""50"" />

I thought it would be great to add a volume bar indicator to provide user with a feedback on what's happening. However, I can't seem to get this to work properly.

OnSamples method of AudioSink class provides raw PCM data as one of the arguments. Also, I set the [AudioFrameSize][2] property of [AudioCaptureDevice][3] to 40 (1000/40 == 25fps), so [OnSamples][4] is triggered every 40ms.

My question is how to extract the sound volume information from PCM data and display it as percentage in a progress bar [0-100]?

---

This is what I have so far:

    double average = 0;
    for (int a = 0; a < sampleData.Length; ++a)
    {
        average += Math.Abs(sampleData[a]);
    }
    average /= sampleData.Length;
    
    double volume = 20 * Math.Log10(average);

Value of the progress bar is then set to volume:

    progressBar.Value = volume;

My code doesn't work, apparently, since the volume value is almost always at the same level.

Any help is appreciated!

•	Silverlight as I think will not be supported on WP8 (Apollo)

•	Even there will be still Silverlight support on WP8 I simply don’t want to use obsolete technology…

For the Windows 8 Metro style application the only relevant choice seems to be the HTML/JavaScript, even there is possibility to use C#/C++ on the top of the WinRT.

![Custom DataGrid][1]

I created a new style for `DataGridRow` based on the default style. I then modified the XAML to add my buttons inside a `StackPanel` (details omitted):

    <UserControl.Resources>
      <Style x:Key=""DataGridRowStyle"" TargetType=""swcd:DataGridRow"">
        <Setter Property=""Template"">

                <Button>
                  ... these are the buttons displayed on the row

The `DataGrid` is modified using the style:

    <swcd:DataGrid RowStyle=""{StaticResource DataGridRowStyle}"">
      ...
    </swcd:DataGrid>

I want to create another grid in a similar manner, but with a different set of buttons at the end of the row. I could create a textual copy of my style and modify it accordingly, but I was hoping that I could create a proper reusable class. I'm not sure how to approach this since the stuff I want to factor out of my style is a collection of controls (buttons) inside a style.

My approach so far is to create a `MyDataGrid` class derived from `DataGrid`. I have added a new property `RowControls` to `MyDataGrid` enabling me to instantiate it like this:

    <local:MyDataGrid>
      <local:MyDataGrid.RowControls>
        <Button>
           ... these controls should go at the end of the row
      </local:MyDataGrid.RowControls>
      ...
    </local:MyDataGrid>

`MyDataGrid` uses a `RowStyle` as described above. But how do the contents of the `MyDataGrid.RowControls` collection get into the `Content` of `RowControlsPanel` in the style? I think I should do that in `OnApplyTemplate` of the `DataGridRow`, but then I need to derive a new `MyDataGridRow` class from `DataGridRow`. Unfortunately it seems that `DataGrid` is hardcoded to use `DataGridRow` and I'm not able to inject my own derived row class. I get the feeling that I need to approach my problem of reuse in a different manner, but I'm not sure how?

Customizing simple controls like buttons by adding new properties and modifying the control template is quite easy, but how do I customize a complex control like `DataGrid` where the template I need to customize is nested inside the grid?

5164224,03/02/2011 06:37:46,470806,10/09/2010 02:40:53,38,1,Include() in EF4 using RIA Services Domain Service not loading!,"I am having trouble returning multiple entities (eager loading) using the Include() method.  I am trying to load the entites in a silverlight application using RIA services.  The Data Model consists of the following relationships:

  Events.ID = EventParticipants.EventsID  
  EventParticipants.ParticipantUserID = Users.ID

So an Event can have many participants and a participant is exactly 1 user.

I can load the Event just fine, but I cannot get **anything** out of the child relationships specified by the Include() statement.

When I load up an Event, I am trying to pull in (using eager loading) all the EventParticipants and their associated user record.  In my domain service I have the following:

        public IQueryable<Event> GetEvents()
        {
            return this.ObjectContext.Events                
                        .Include(""EventParticipants"")
                        .Include(""EventParticipants.User"");

        }

I then take the IQueryable that is returned and load it using my Domain Context on the client side like so:

    DomainContext.Load(DomainContext.GetEventsQuery(), LoadOperationCompleted, true);

(normally I would filter this but I simplified everything to get to the heart of the problem)

In my LoadOperationCompleted I have 2 loops that I use to see if the Event Participants are returned but I never receive any participants back from the query.  (in the database, I have 242 Events defined...all of which have participants)

        private void LoadOperationCompleted(LoadOperation lo)
        {

            if (lo.Error != null)
            {
                Debugger.Break();
                lo.MarkErrorAsHandled();
            }

            foreach (Event item in lo.Entities)
            {
                
                foreach (var particpant in item.EventParticipants)
                {
                    Debug.WriteLine(""{0} {1}"", particpant.User.First, particpant.User.Last);
                }

            }

        }

I have also modified the above code (see below) to spin through the original domain context instead of the entities collection that is passed in through the load operation parameters to no avail.

    foreach (Event item in DomainContext.Events)

In my Data Model, there are three constructors (all generated) with varying parameters. In each I have disabled lazy loading like so:

    this.ContextOptions.LazyLoadingEnabled = false;

There was an annotation in the xml representation of the DataModel.edmx.  I think this is just for generation purposes...but I changed that too like so:

    <EntityContainer Name=""MyCrazyEntities"" annotation:LazyLoadingEnabled=""false"">

I have defined relationships in my SQL Server 2008 database.  The designer picked these up and created all of the relationships and navigation properties in my model.  Inspecting them, they appear valid.  If I fat finger the spelling of the Entities in the include statement, it throws an error saying the path is not valid (or something to that effect)...so I believe the relationships exist and are functional (and I can see their definitions in the designer code and whatnot).

I have removed all the filtering and specifically the additional joins I have placed on the query before issuing it.  This was to ensure I wasn't encountering the problem with joins changing the shape of the query and breaking the Includes().  Seems to be a big problem for people, I have eliminated all joins in this manner to isolate the problem.  It is not a combination of joins and includes.

I have rebuilt my silverlight projects that house the domain service and RIA Services DLL a couple of times thinking I had some setting wrong.  I have used the POCO class generator with EF but then read you can't include the same way with POCOs...so I scrapped that too.

I fired up SQL Server profiler and captured the SQL from a base query and one with Includes().  The data for the Includes **ARE BEING RETURNED**.  I verified this by copying the query from profiler and issuing it directly  A simplified version of the query is as follows.  The relationships are valid and I can see all the related data is there (i.e. participant names, phone numbers, etc)

    SELECT 
    'trimmed fields for brevity>'
    FROM ( SELECT 
    	'trimmed fields for brevity>'
    	CASE WHEN ([Join1].[ID1] IS NULL) THEN CAST(NULL AS int) ELSE 1 END AS [C1]
    	FROM  [dbo].[Events] AS [Extent1]
        	LEFT OUTER JOIN  (SELECT 'trimmed fields for brevity>'
    		FROM  [dbo].[EventParticipants] AS [Extent2]
    		INNER JOIN [dbo].[Users] AS [Extent3] ON [Extent2].[ParticipantUsersID] = [Extent3].[ID] ) AS [Join1] ON [Extent1].[ID] = [Join1].[EventsID]
    )  AS [Project1]

Any help is greatly appreciated.  I am at my wits end.  **Thanks in advance!**",silverlight,entity-framework,ria-services,eager-loading,include-path,,open,0,1124,10,"Include() in EF4 using RIA Services Domain Service not loading! I am having trouble returning multiple entities (eager loading) using the Include() method.  I am trying to load the entites in a silverlight application using RIA services.  The Data Model consists of the following relationships:

  Events.ID = EventParticipants.EventsID  
  EventParticipants.ParticipantUserID = Users.ID

So an Event can have many participants and a participant is exactly 1 user.

I can load the Event just fine, but I cannot get **anything** out of the child relationships specified by the Include() statement.

When I load up an Event, I am trying to pull in (using eager loading) all the EventParticipants and their associated user record.  In my domain service I have the following:

        public IQueryable<Event> GetEvents()
        {
            return this.ObjectContext.Events                
                        .Include(""EventParticipants"")
                        .Include(""EventParticipants.User"");

        }

I then take the IQueryable that is returned and load it using my Domain Context on the client side like so:

    DomainContext.Load(DomainContext.GetEventsQuery(), LoadOperationCompleted, true);

(normally I would filter this but I simplified everything to get to the heart of the problem)

In my LoadOperationCompleted I have 2 loops that I use to see if the Event Participants are returned but I never receive any participants back from the query.  (in the database, I have 242 Events defined...all of which have participants)

        private void LoadOperationCompleted(LoadOperation lo)
        {

            if (lo.Error != null)
            {
                Debugger.Break();
                lo.MarkErrorAsHandled();
            }

            foreach (Event item in lo.Entities)
            {
                
                foreach (var particpant in item.EventParticipants)
                {
                    Debug.WriteLine(""{0} {1}"", particpant.User.First, particpant.User.Last);
                }

            }

        }

I have also modified the above code (see below) to spin through the original domain context instead of the entities collection that is passed in through the load operation parameters to no avail.

    foreach (Event item in DomainContext.Events)

In my Data Model, there are three constructors (all generated) with varying parameters. In each I have disabled lazy loading like so:

    this.ContextOptions.LazyLoadingEnabled = false;

There was an annotation in the xml representation of the DataModel.edmx.  I think this is just for generation purposes...but I changed that too like so:

    <EntityContainer Name=""MyCrazyEntities"" annotation:LazyLoadingEnabled=""false"">

I have defined relationships in my SQL Server 2008 database.  The designer picked these up and created all of the relationships and navigation properties in my model.  Inspecting them, they appear valid.  If I fat finger the spelling of the Entities in the include statement, it throws an error saying the path is not valid (or something to that effect)...so I believe the relationships exist and are functional (and I can see their definitions in the designer code and whatnot).

I have removed all the filtering and specifically the additional joins I have placed on the query before issuing it.  This was to ensure I wasn't encountering the problem with joins changing the shape of the query and breaking the Includes().  Seems to be a big problem for people, I have eliminated all joins in this manner to isolate the problem.  It is not a combination of joins and includes.

I have rebuilt my silverlight projects that house the domain service and RIA Services DLL a couple of times thinking I had some setting wrong.  I have used the POCO class generator with EF but then read you can't include the same way with POCOs...so I scrapped that too.

I fired up SQL Server profiler and captured the SQL from a base query and one with Includes().  The data for the Includes **ARE BEING RETURNED**.  I verified this by copying the query from profiler and issuing it directly  A simplified version of the query is as follows.  The relationships are valid and I can see all the related data is there (i.e. participant names, phone numbers, etc)

    'trimmed fields for brevity>'
    FROM ( SELECT 
    	'trimmed fields for brevity>'

Actual Data

There are no records in the database with field duration == 0 and costD should also be more than 0.01 (which I get). 

",silverlight,entity,,,,,open,0,933,11,"Silverlight RIA does not expose all int and decimal values correctly I got an issue with Silverlight RIA Services.

        }
    }

Using debugger I checked the values of the entities returned by GetCalls() - they are correct, however the service itself generates invalid output in binary format - it does not specify some field values, and Silverlight client automatically assigns default values.

But all string values and some int values are parsed correctly.


Here is what I get in binary format

So I've tried to make an application which relies on images being scaled by an individual factor. These images are then able to be turned over, but the use of an animation working on the ProjectionPlane rotation.

The problem comes around when an image is both scaled and rotated. For some reason it starts bluring, where a non scaled image doesn't blur.

Also, if you look at the example image below (top is scaled and rotated, bottom is rotated) the projection of the top one doesn't even seem right. Its too horizontal.

I have been hired to maintain and enhance a 10+ years old 3 tier application that was written in C++ using COM/DCOM and MSDE. The previous developpers did not put much effort in implementing improvement plans, thus leaving the application in the pre-.NET era!

Now, we have a few requests to implement new features that could easily be done in .NET, but would be longer tom implement and test in VC++... Also, new UI elements are requested that, to my point of view, do not relate to what is available right now. Thus leaving me with the impression that a seperate UI would be a better choice than fitting the new stuff in.

I seek advise to choose between available platforms like Silverlight, WPF, WinForm, ASP.NET etc. I can code on most of these platforms with a mimimum learning curve. 

For example, I was thinking of something like a thin client (ASP, Silverlight?) exchanging dynamic data with a WCF service (witch could be connected via interop with COM server) and finally, use a BO layer to access SQL Server data...

Developpement should be fast, maintainable and allow migration of existing application to new architechture.

Any comments, suggestions?

Now, we have a few requests to implement new features that could easily be done in .NET, but would be longer tom implement and test in VC++... Also, new UI elements are requested that, to my point of view, do not relate to what is available right now. Thus leaving me with the impression that a seperate UI would be a better choice than fitting the new stuff in.

I seek advise to choose between available platforms like Silverlight, WPF, WinForm, ASP.NET etc. I can code on most of these platforms with a mimimum learning curve. 

For example, I was thinking of something like a thin client (ASP, Silverlight?) exchanging dynamic data with a WCF service (witch could be connected via interop with COM server) and finally, use a BO layer to access SQL Server data...

Developpement should be fast, maintainable and allow migration of existing application to new architechture.

Any comments, suggestions? 

Thanks in advance

On the form, I have some simple TextBox(es) and some ComboBox(es) for entering basic information for an Employee.  In my architecture, I have some base classes, one to handle the Collections of objects (ObservableCollection and INotifyPropertyChanged implemented) and one that is for the Entity (catches and calls OnPropertyChanged(""prop"").  In my code behind file (.cs), I have an event handler that handles the _SelectedItemChanged() for the ComboBox(es), for example, EmployeeType, where in the database, values might be like Director, Staff, Reporter, Manager, etc. for the Code column (other columns exist in the EmployeeType table like Description, ModifiedDate, and ID).  I have some constructors on my form control, and when I load the form with an empty constructor and thus nothing is loaded (which is the way it should load and correct), everything works perfectly, i.e. I can enter data like FirstName (TextBox), HireData (TextBox), and EmployeeType (ComboBox).  The issue I am having is when, I am loading this form, and I know the EmployeeType before-hand, so I don't know how to set the ComboBox's SelectedItem programmatically?

I tried something like this, say I want the form to load the EmployeeType as Manager, so I have in my Load() method:

    private SetEmployeeType()
    {
         var employeeType = new EmployeeType { Code = ""Manager"" };
         this.EmployeeTypeComboBox.SelectedItem = employeeType;
    }

But as I'm tracing through my code (F5), I see employeeType as an EmployeeType, but it's properties not fully populated (all blank except for Code as I explicitly called ""Manager"" above), so when my _SelectedItemChanged() event is called, the .SelectedItem = null, and thus the ComboBox is loaded with nothing picked (the ItemSource is bound to a list and it does come through properly).

FYI, I have other methods where I load my list of EmployeeTypes, e.g. GetEmployeeTypes() and that loads fine.  If the ComboBox is blank and then I pick a value, the correct value is submitted to the database, but like I noted, sometimes I want to pre-define the SelectedItem and thus disable the ComboBox to disallow the User from entering invalid data.  

I even tried some LINQ like so and it seems not to work:

    var type = from e in employeeTypeList // collection loads fine with 10 items
         where e.Code = ""Manager""
         select e;

When I trace through the above query, the 'type' does come back with the correct EntityType object with all of the properties populated (count=1 which is correct), but it doesn't seem to bind to the ComboBox since the ComboBox's SelectedItemChanged() is expecting something like this:

    var employeeType = this.EmployeeType.SelectedItem as EmployeeType; // i.e. expecting EmployeeType

but instead, my LINQ query brings back a value of something like:

    IEnumerable<EmployeeType> // with some extra stuff...

PS. I am working off from memory since I am currently at home and this is from my code at work, so please excuse me if I am missing something obvious.  I have tried different scenarios, and just can't seem to figure it out.  Thanks in advance for any assistance!

but instead, my LINQ query brings back a value of something like:

    IEnumerable<EmployeeType> // with some extra stuff...

PS. I am working off from memory since I am currently at home and this is from my code at work, so please excuse me if I am missing something obvious.  I have tried different scenarios, and just can't seem to figure it out.  Thanks in advance for any assistance!

Where, dtGrid is my DataGrid control...

The Question is: How to get the UI Updated after adding one more register to my list.

I get to solve it setting the DataGrid's Item Source to """" and them setting to the list of Customer objects again, like that:

    1    private void Button_Click(object sender, System.Windows.RoutedEventArgs e)
    2    
    3    {
    4    
    5    c.Add(new Customer{_nome = ""Maiara"",_idade = ""18""});
    6    
    7    this.dtGrid.ItemsSource="""";
    8    
    9    this.dtGrid.ItemsSource=c;
    10   
    11   }
    12   


Is there a way to get the UI updated or the datagrid's itemsSource refreshed automatically after updating, altering or deleting a item from the list<Customer> c ?



Thank you,

1.   NameAB
2.   DescriptionA
3.   BodyA              (Should have been BodyAB)

If I only make a change into Body its not updated.
If I only make a change into Name it is updated.

This is very wierd behavior. Tracing the code down through the domain service I see the changed record having the correct changes - as far as the old record it just contained the ID and everything else was null, this is probably by design but I dont spend much time debugging the domain services layer.

2.   DescriptionA
3.   BodyA              (Should have been BodyAB)

If I only make a change into Body its not updated.
If I only make a change into Name it is updated.

This is very wierd behavior. Tracing the code down through the domain service I see the changed record having the correct changes - as far as the old record it just contained the ID and everything else was null, this is probably by design but I dont spend much time debugging the domain services layer.

Any ideas?

I have to deal with fairly large legacy application that has some web services exposed (regular asmx, not wcf). What I need to do is to build Silverlight app that consumes those web services. Due to business logic I need to have the same web method to be called from Silverlight app synchronously. I was able to build web services consumption but only asynchronously because that would be default Silverlight behavior. 

Is there a way to make asynchronous calls synchronous in Silverlight? I looked here and googled around but came across only wcf examples. I would appreciate if somebody would get me a code example for regular asmx web service. I use Silverlight 4.0.

I've configured my application to parse the CSV file to return a `List<CSVTransaction>` that contains properties with names: `Date`, `Payee`, `Category`, `Memo`, `Inflow`, `Outflow`.

The user clicks a button to select a file to parse, at which point I want the `DataGrid` object to be populated.  I'm thinking I want to use data binding, but I can't seem to figure out how to get the data to show up in the grid.
