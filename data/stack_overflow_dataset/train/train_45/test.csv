The social games pack is an MVC based publication template that beautifully combines Azure ACS control, entity framework database on azure SQL (for hi scores and display name) and JSON-AJAX scripts to assist in handling the controllers in a hacker-secured professional way.

I see on silverlight and flash flex they use a system called OAuth to authenticate(I do not understand its relationship with ACS). Other tutorials that are available to learn how to connect client and server DB did not use entity framework or azure blob storage (always different incompatible parts) so it was hard even to begin to form a functional architecture for my purpose (MMORPG) which handles multiple databases and remain secure. Also ideally the solution would leave the door open for things such as message queuing and CDN.

My question is quite simple :

- How exactly does the javascript client read and write/update scores on the EF database, and how is that automatically linked to the player's display name in a secure way?

The goal being to have a game client in javascript/HTML 5 or silverlight or Flash/Flex... they all have plugins for connecting data and using CRUD operations (WCF or HTTP or XML) they just don't seem to authenticate or have any instructions on how to achieve this ; hence my appreciation of Mr. Totten's idea to make the ACS external and use tokens to allow the application to make changes to the game database. This way we would not need to complexify the client side too much, making as much things server-sided as possible. Right ?

IIS Express is running from the Pen Drive fine at the moment but I am not sure how to configure the app pools.

I think I am also right in saying MS SQL CE uses .sdf instead of .mdf for databases, how can I make an existing .mdf database into the right format?

Here are the reasons I do NOT think Canonical is a good approach for our project.

 - We have no immediate (<5 years) requirement to expose any internal services to the enterprise.
 - Time required for governance.  (Developing adapters with data transformation logic, developing XSDs, and developing contracts [fault, data, and operation]).
 - No need to expose a different data contracts than what exists in the data layer
 - It doesn’t appear that we can easily use ‘self tracking entities’ with the Canonical approach.

Here are some reasons I’m considering using Canonical approach.

 - We can use the XSD schemas for data type and length validation.
 - We will be prepared to allow consumption of our services to the enterprise, whether it’s 5 years or 1 year.
 - We can feel good that we’re implementing best practices. :)

Basically, there is a treeview that is bound to a collection of objects.  The idea is that as a user selects a specific treeviewitem, a call is made to the data service, with a parameter specific to the selected treeviewitem being passed to the corresponding web method in the data service.  The data service returns data back to the SL3 client, and the client presents the data to the user.

This works well.  The problem is that when users start to navigate through the treeview using the arrow keys on their keyboard, they could press the down arrow key, for example, 10 times, and 10 calls will be made to the data service, and then each of the 10 items will be displayed to the user momentarily, until finishing with the data for the most recently selected treeview item.

So - onto the question.  How can I put in some form of delay, to allow someone to navigate quickly through a treeview, then, once then stop at a certain treeviewitem, a call is made to the data service?

In the Northwind database, there is a table Order_Details which is connected to two other tables (Orders and Products) via foreign keys:

![Picture of Data Model][1]

The code to query the database looks like this:

    EntityQuery<Order_Detail> detailQuery = _MyDomainContext.GetOrder_DetailsQuery();

    _MyDomainContext.Load(detailQuery.Where(
                det => det.Order.Customer.CustomerID == cust.CustomerID).OrderByDescending(
                det => det.Order.OrderDate).Take(10), OnDetailsLoaded, null);

and then in OnDetailsLoaded:


    var details = loadOp.Entities;
    if (details != null)
            {
                var detailsList = details.ToList();

                        OrderDate = det.Order.OrderDate.Value
                    }));


This gives me a Null Exception at `new OrderItem`, because both Product and Order are null. I have set my EntityDataModel to ""Include Foreign Key Columns in the Model"". The code is exactly as in the tutorial, I only had to recreate the ADO.Net EntityDataModel and the DomainService to work with my local database, so the error is probably somewhere there.

How would I debug this error? I have no previous experience with databases. I'm using SQL Server 2012 with a Northwind database adapted for 2012, while the tutorial was written with SQL Server 2008 RC.

                        OrderDate = det.Order.OrderDate.Value
                    }));


This gives me a Null Exception at `new OrderItem`, because both Product and Order are null. I have set my EntityDataModel to ""Include Foreign Key Columns in the Model"". The code is exactly as in the tutorial, I only had to recreate the ADO.Net EntityDataModel and the DomainService to work with my local database, so the error is probably somewhere there.

How would I debug this error? I have no previous experience with databases. I'm using SQL Server 2012 with a Northwind database adapted for 2012, while the tutorial was written with SQL Server 2008 RC.

And then there would need be some code the says, when the browser window is less than 480px wide use 480styles.xaml, when the browser is 481px to 768px wide use 768styles.xaml ... and so on. 

I'm a UI designer as opposed to a developer and therefore pretty code-illiterate so I apologize if this is poorly explained or not even remotely possible. Thanks in advance for any help you can offer!",5

Although this compiles fine, it does not run correctly.

This works great.  My issue is in trying to duplicate this functionallity dynamically.

    RadioButton rb = new RadioButton() {GroupName = ""Gender"", Content = ""Male"" ,Width = (double)49,HorizontalAlignment = System.Windows.HorizontalAlignment.Left};

this works but when I try to put the converter in, it breaks.  What is the proper way to do this?  Any good working examples?

Here is what I tried....

    RadioButton rb = new RadioButton() {GroupName = ""Gender"", Content = ""Male"" ,Width = (double)49,HorizontalAlignment = System.Windows.HorizontalAlignment.Left};

    RadioStringConverter rsc = new RadioStringConverter();

    Binding binding = new Binding(layout.FieldName) { Source = mainLayout.DataContext, Mode = BindingMode.TwoWay,ConverterParameter = 1,Converter = rsc};  // to emulate the ""{StaticResource RadioStringConverter}""};

    rb.SetBinding(RadioButton.IsCheckedProperty, binding);

    sp.Children.Add(rb);


Although this compiles fine, it does not run correctly.
1) How do I reference the static resource dynamically?
2) How do I add this static resource to the XAML dynamically?  Right now I have this reference hard coded.

Am I making this more difficult than it needs to be?

If you have a reference to the bound collection (or can cast the value of the DataGrid’s
ItemsSource property to that type), then you should be able to simply call its Add or Insert method.

            return this.ObjectContext.Configuration.Include(""Interaction"").Include(""Interaction.Activity"").Where(c=> c.StartDate < System.DateTime.Now);

However, I want to apply the same **where** filtering on the Interactions and Activities, but, if I do a nested where clause on the Activity, and there was no Activity to be found with the specified date then it would not return any Configuration object either. Which is not my desired behavior. It should be more of an independent filtering on each of the entities.

Found this article, which is more or less what I need.
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4540523/linq-filter-collection-inside-collection

This is pretended to be implemented on a domain service method that returns the IQueryable<Configuration>, in a way that resembles doing the query with the includes but the related article returns a List, and I need to return an EntityCollection.

Thanks!",silverlight,linq-to-entities,ria,domainservices,,,open,0,1001,12,"WCF RIA Services, Domain Service filtering child and grandchild tables with linq I have three tables, Configuration->Interaction->Activity

I am aware I can bring the whole configuration with its related interactions and activities by doing something like this. (And the related [Include] in metadata)

            return this.ObjectContext.Configuration.Include(""Interaction"").Include(""Interaction.Activity"").Where(c=> c.StartDate < System.DateTime.Now);

However, I want to apply the same **where** filtering on the Interactions and Activities, but, if I do a nested where clause on the Activity, and there was no Activity to be found with the specified date then it would not return any Configuration object either. Which is not my desired behavior. It should be more of an independent filtering on each of the entities.

Found this article, which is more or less what I need.
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4540523/linq-filter-collection-inside-collection

This is pretended to be implemented on a domain service method that returns the IQueryable<Configuration>, in a way that resembles doing the query with the includes but the related article returns a List, and I need to return an EntityCollection. 

Tried the article's suggestion like this:

        public IQueryable<Configuration> GetConfiguration_Interaction_Activity()
        {

            return (from c in this.ObjectContext.Configuration

                                         from i in c.Interaction

I don't want to use Rx for the sake of Rx, but if it can allow me to organize the logic above so it is easier to read/maintain in the method, I'll take advantage of it. Ideally, something like: 

    Observable.Create(
       ()=>firstAction(), 
       ()=>secondAction())
    .Subscribe(action=>action(),error=>{ throw error; }); 

With the power threading library, I'd do something like: 

    Service.Query(list=>{result=list};
    yield return 1;
    ProcessList(result);
    Service.Query(widget=>{defaultWidget=widget};
    yield return 1;
    CurrentWidget = defaultWidget;

That makes it far more evident that the workflow is sequential and eliminates nesting (the yields are part of the async enumerator and are boundaries that block until the results come back).

Anything similar would make sense to me.

I have tried using the popup's child's width, but this is set to 0 during the MouseEnter event, because it is hidden.

I'm new to Silverlight so any help would be appreciated.",silverlight,silverlight-3.0,c#,xaml,,,open,0,822,3,"Silverlight popup ActualSize In Silverlight 3, I am trying to create a pop up menu for navigation.  I am using a HyperlinkButton as a trigger, which when moused over displays a Popup containing more HyperlinkButtons.  The root node is right aligned and I want the sub-menu to appear to the left.  My problem is that I am trying to position the popup using its ActualWidth property, but this value appears fixed at the size of the root element (which contains the trigger and the popup), so if the popup is narrower it leaves an unsightly gap and if wider it overwrites the trigger.

Here is my XAML:

    <Grid x:Name=""LayoutRoot"" Background=""White"">

        <Grid x:Name=""Root"" HorizontalAlignment=""Right"" VerticalAlignment=""Top"">

This is working perfect by using ""ValidatesOnDataErrors"" in the control I want to check.

For example, when I write ""june"" in a DateTimePicker control the binding is broken (the property is a DateTime) so it never gets its value and I can't control the errors the same way I do with the rest of rules.

How should I try this? Is there any solution?
