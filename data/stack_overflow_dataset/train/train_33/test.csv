I have been using a pretty slick generic invoke method for UI updating from background threads.  I forget where I copied it from (converted it to VB.NET from C#), but here it is:

        Else
            Action(Control)

Now, I want to modify this to make a function that returns Nothing if no invoke was required (or an exception was thrown) or the IAsyncResult returned from BeginInvoke if invoke was required.  Here's what I have:

            Try

        Else
            Action(Control)
            Return Nothing
        End If
    End Function

I wanted to do this primarily to avoid blocking.  The problem is that I now get errors when making calls such as this:


    InvokeControl(SomeTextBox, Sub(x) x.Text = ""Some text"")

This worked fine with the original Invoke (rather than BeginInvoke) method.  Now I get a ""Object reference not set to an instance of an object"" exception.  If I put a watch on SomeTextBox, it says

    SomeTextBox {Text = (Text) threw an exception of type Microsoft.VisualStudio.Debugger.Runtime.CrossThreadMessagingException.}

It might be relevant that such InvokeControl calls come from within a System.Timers.Timer's Elapsed event.  Its Interval is 500ms, which should be more than long enough for the UI updates to complete (if that matters).  What is going on?

                    Debug.Print(""data len: "" & data.Length)

        End Sub


Two things, first I don't want to sue PaddingMode.PKCS7 but when I change it to PaddingMode.None I get an error which says ""Length of the data to encrypt is invalid"".

Second, I have a decryption SUB and it still works if I send it a bogus IV. Why is the IV not effecting the decryption process.

### DECRYPTION ###

In Air I'm using the com.hurlant.crypto package I found. Here is my function:

    public static function decryptZip(src:ByteArray, k:String):ByteArray {
    
    	var key:ByteArray = Hex.toArray(Hex.fromString(k));	
    	var iv:ByteArray = Hex.toArray(Hex.fromString(k));	
    
    	var mode:CFBMode = new CFBMode(new AESKey(key), new PKCS7(256));
    	mode.IV = iv;
    
    	mode.decrypt(src);
    
    	return src;
    
    }

This is not working ... Note that I tried to write a PKCS7 class based on a Java class I found. The hurlant package I downloaded only had PKCS5. VB.NET did not provide any of the same padding classes as hurlant comes with. I wish I could using ""None"" but I couldn't get passed the error in VB.

",vb.net,anchor-tag,,,,,open,0,140,10,"vb.net if statement using the value of hash in URL I have a page with a URL that includes a hash value (www.mysite.com/#123).

What I want to do is use that value to determine what is displayed on the page - much like using a querystring.

I am using the hash value because the content on the page can be changed client side (I am avoiding page reloads where possible) - if the user then links to another page and uses the back button to return, I need to use the hash value to display the page as it was when they left it.

So I'm looking for an if statement that will look something like this:

    if hashvalue = 123 then
        Do this
    else
        do that

The goal is a tool-tip with rounded corners and other specific features to replace the default Windows tool tip.

Ideally the tool tip could be antialiased and blended into the backdrop, however at a pinch I could tolerate an aliased boundary. This may also be necessary as the control will often be covering a control with an OpenGL overlay and the whole blending procedure may end up a nightmare.

I have created a custom user control, a persistent instance of which belonds to my applications's main form, overriding the OnPaint and OnPaintBackground methods. The application of transparency however is challenging. As I understand, the graphics object passed to the paint method starts with a copy of the current VisibleClipBounds, where generally the first move is to clear the control with a solid colour and start drawing the main features. My first thought was to bypass the fill and start drawing on the captured background. For the first redraw this works fine, but subsequent redraws keep the previous content instead of re-capturing the backdrop. I hoped that CopyFromScreen would specifically eliminate the currently drawing control from its capture so as to start from a clean base but this is not the case, it captures the rectangle of the new location including the image of the previous location if it is in the bounds.

Other solutions and permutations thereof such as

    SetStyle(ControlStyles.SupportsTransparentBackColor, True)

    Me.BackColor = Color.Transparent

    e.Graphics.Clear(Color.FromArgb(0,0,0,0))

have to-date yielded no appropriate results.

I started with a  transparent form using the transparent key colour. This worked with aliasing but using a form as a tool tip seemed excessive and caused annoying artifacts (some of which could be overcome) such as the temporary presence of the taskbar button, focus loss of underlying form with subsequent visual feedback in the host form's title bar colour. The control is much lighter weight but I am struggling to make it work even as well as the form.

At this point I simply ask how to achieve the desired result and whether CopyFromScreen is a part of that solution.",vb.net,winforms,transparency,alpha-transparency,,,open,0,380,11,"(How c| C)an I use Graphics.CopyFromScreen to enable alpha transparent controls?

The application of transparency however is challenging. As I understand, the graphics object passed to the paint method starts with a copy of the current VisibleClipBounds, where generally the first move is to clear the control with a solid colour and start drawing the main features. My first thought was to bypass the fill and start drawing on the captured background. For the first redraw this works fine, but subsequent redraws keep the previous content instead of re-capturing the backdrop. I hoped that CopyFromScreen would specifically eliminate the currently drawing control from its capture so as to start from a clean base but this is not the case, it captures the rectangle of the new location including the image of the previous location if it is in the bounds.

Other solutions and permutations thereof such as

    SetStyle(ControlStyles.SupportsTransparentBackColor, True)

    Me.BackColor = Color.Transparent

    e.Graphics.Clear(Color.FromArgb(0,0,0,0))

have to-date yielded no appropriate results.

I started with a  transparent form using the transparent key colour. This worked with aliasing but using a form as a tool tip seemed excessive and caused annoying artifacts (some of which could be overcome) such as the temporary presence of the taskbar button, focus loss of underlying form with subsequent visual feedback in the host form's title bar colour. The control is much lighter weight but I am struggling to make it work even as well as the form.

At this point I simply ask how to achieve the desired result and whether CopyFromScreen is a part of that solution.",4
