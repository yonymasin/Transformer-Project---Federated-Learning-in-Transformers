By clicking to column header of datagridview a textbox ""txtSifra"" appears at right place only first time after program starts but later VB places it something upper from desired location.

At the moment, this list consists of a little over 100 URLs all on different domains (but I'd like a scalable solution which could deal with many more).

I have written some code which creates an HttpWebRequest and calls BeginGetResponse in a loop, using System.Diagnostics.Stopwatch to record the time each call is made.

I then record the completion time in the callback function once the entire content has been downloaded.

However, when I run the code, the total time for each request steadily increases - taking up to around 15 seconds by the time we get to the last request.

If I introduce a delay of, for example, 1 second in the loop where I kick-off the requests, I get much more realistic response times throughout the entire job (a few hundred milliseconds).

I'm guessing there is some sort of internal queueing going on 'behind the scenes' such that the requests aren't being made immediately. I clearly don't want to just introduce an arbitrary delay in the code, so I could do with some help understanding what's going on.

Should I be doing something on a number of different threads? Should I be throttling my requests? If so, what metric should I monitor to decide whether or not to start more requests?

I've found several good ideas here, as well as on CodeProject.  My code looks very similar to this C# code at http://www.codeproject.com/KB/cs/Unit_Conversion_Sample.aspx 
From the following you'll probably gather that I'm pretty new to programming:)  

I've created a Units base class that I inherit to create each unit type.  

    Public Class Units
    Private _unitvalue As Double
    Private _unittype As [Enum]

    Public Sub New(UnitValue As Double, UnitType As [Enum])
        _unitvalue = UnitValue

            Return _unitvalue

        Set(value As Double)

    Public Overrides Function ToString() As String
        Return String.Format(""{0} {1}"", UnitValue.ToString(), UnitType.ToString())
    End Function

    End Class

I then inherit this class to start creating Units with a Unit conversion function included.

    Public Class WeightUnit
    Inherits Units
    Enum WeightSym
        'Pounds
        Lbs
        'Kilograms
        Kg
    End Enum
    Sub New(UnitValue As Double, UnitType As WeightSym)
        MyBase.New(UnitValue, UnitType)
    End Sub
    Public Function Convert(toUnit As WeightSym) As WeightUnit
        'Base Weight Unit is Lbs

        Dim fromUnit As WeightSym
        fromUnit = UnitType

        Dim Lbs As Double = 0
        Select Case fromUnit
            'Standard
            Case WeightSym.Lbs
                Lbs = UnitValue
            Case WeightSym.Kg
                Lbs = UnitValue * 2.2046226
        End Select

        Dim toVal As Double = 0
        'to unit based on Lbs
        Select Case toUnit
            'Standard
            Case WeightSym.Lbs
                toVal = Lbs
            Case WeightSym.Kg
                toVal = Lbs * 0.4535924
        End Select
        Return New WeightUnit(toVal, toUnit)
    End Function
    End Class

I need to create several different Unit types, such as Length, Pressure, etc.  This is working well except for one issue.  I'd like to be able to change the UnitType, and automatically update the UnitValue. Such that if the Unit object has a value of 1 and a type of Inch, and the type is changed to Cm, the value would update to 2.54.

Something like this....   I've seen examples of this, but the difference here is that, I can't specify the Covert function in my base class because it changes with each new UnitClass I create.    

    Public Property UnitType() As [Enum]
    Get
        Return _unittype
    End Get
    Set(value As [Enum])
        _unittype = value
        _unitvalue = Convert(value).UnitValue
    End Set
    End Property

I tried making the Property UnitType Overridable and creating a new Override Property for UnitType in each UnitClass that I created, but I failed to get that to work.  

Any suggestions are much appreciated.

    'Comparer' is not a member of '<anonymous method>'

If I assign the function to an explicitly typed variable it works, like this:

            Dim CICF As Func(Of String, String, Boolean) = (Function(a As String, b As String) As Boolean
                                                                If a.ToUpper = b.ToUpper Then
                                                                    Return True
                                                                Else
                                                                    Return False
                                                                End If
                                                            End Function)

            Dim CIC = CICF.Comparer

So my questions is, can I type the extension method in a way that lets me use the one-liner style I'm looking for? Thats to say, how can I type the extension method to accept an anonymous method?

What makes it even harder is that I can't replicate this problem on my computer very consistently. Sometimes I will get the error but most of the time I won't.

Basically what is happening is I am creating an IE object which my program then controls for a long period of time.  What is happening is, if a user exits the program it calls oIE.Quit() then closes the program. This should close internet explorer and all processes associated with it.

But, the iexplorer process doesn't end up closing. Then when the user tries to run the program again we get this error ""System.Runtime.InteropServices.COMException (0x80004005): Creating an instance of the COM component with CLSID {0002DF01-0000-0000-C000-000000000046} from the IClassFactory failed due to the following error: 80004005."". 

To fix this we simply close the any iexplorer.exe processes that are open and it will let us create our ie object again. This happens also if the program crashes and they try to restart it.

I am not sure what is causing this or if I am missing something that has to do with com objects. But I am simply stuck.


Here is some code although plugging in this code likely won't reproduce any errors:

    'create ie object
    oIE = New SHDocVw.InternetExplorer
    oIE.Navigate(""http://www.google.com"")

How/Where can i get the error ""response validation not conforming to wsdl and schema"" in my vb.net webservice client. I checked the response using the validate response option, within soapui tool. Is there any way to generate the logs related to this, in .net 
client?There was no exception in my .net client, except the response object was blank, even though i could see the response xml in the trace log.

The below line invokes the webservice. After the excution, tracelog has the request and response xml, however my objresp(response object) is empty. In soapui, i validated the response, it was not conforming to schema.



    objresponsehead = objProxy.myoperation(objreqheader, objrequest, objresp)

But this is **incredibly** slow!  Incredibly slow = 2500 characters/minute (I timed it with StopWatch).  Most of my files are around 6,000 words/30,000 characters (about 25 pages).  But there are some documents that are in the 100's of pages...

Is there a faster way of doing this?  I have to support Office 2003 format files, so the OpenXML SDK isn't an option.",3

I did it by moving control to it, but that does not work the way I want.
I used code DataRepeater1.currentIndex=5, and then picked the value.  Is there any possibility of getting the value without moving control to this row.  I mean the way we get value from datagridview (vrName=datagridview1.item(1,1).value)

In the case that there aren't available values 'Year' that not recurs in the other records, it's good to take whatever value.

**example #2 [non-working] (Calling same function but this time within an object)**<br>

I have to add 3 or more class types to the save file, I'd rather not have it split up because then it would get confusing for my clients.

Basically, I have to add things similar to the following:

 - A class with **`X`**, **`Y`**, and **`Value`**
 - A class with **`Name`** and **`Value`**
 - A class with **`Name`**, **`ENUMVALUE`**, **`X`**, **`Y`**, **`INTEGERVALUE`**, and a couple other things (This one will have to contain quite a bit of data).

I'm trying to create a Server/Client Sync scenario for my application using Sync Services for ADO.NET specifically the LocalCache custom tool which sets the whole thing up for me.
My server DB has 5 Tables, all of which are being synchronized to the client application, which now has a SQL Server Compact DB with the same schema as the server DB. I have a dataset with some custom queries that I use to connect my app with the local database.
So far so good.
However in my application when I try to fill one of my tables with the table adapter on my form (the default ""fill"" method) it gives me the following exception:

No mapping exists from DbType Object to a known SqlDbType.

However, if I continue and do the fill again, IT WORKS without a problem.

If I do the above code twice, one right after the other, the first one fails, the second works.

Another point to mention is that this happens only with this datatable, all the other 4 tables in the DB work as expected.

Does anyone have an idea what could be the cause of this?

I'm in the development of and API for a set of devices communicating with each other, and optionally with a PC trough a socket based gateway. The API describes the multitude of different devices, channels as a class hierarchy, and also implements some kind of caching for the derived objects. 

I'd like to make the API really simple to use for the developers, so I keep the interfaces as simple as possible: hiding background threading, etc... I ran into the already described problems, when registering event handlers from a windows form interface: 

1. The event source object is in the cache, it keeps the reference to the target object, preventing it from garbage collection. It's quite problematic, because the UI creates and destroys controls (providing some kind of user interface for the device objects) on the fly... for example when a new device is discovered, or when view is changed.

2. As the event raiser might be a different thread than the UI, so it requires checking in each of the event handler routines.

I was reading the WeakEvent pattern guidelines - I'm not too happy with that solution:
- It's not ""standard"" - so the programmer has to register for events ""manually""
- And quite complex to build.

I ended up with Custom Event declarations, like:
<!-- language-all: lang-vb -->

    Private EHL_Received As New PacketEventHandlerList(""PacketReceived"")
    Public Custom Event PacketReceived As EventHandler Implements I_PacketEventRaiser.PacketReceived
        AddHandler(ByVal value As EventHandler)

            EHL_Received.Invoke(sender, e)
        End RaiseEvent
    End Event

Then, in the ""event handler"" list, instead of storing real EventHandlers, I collect custom objects: they keep weak references to the targets.

I've spent a lot of time looking, but I haven't found what I'm looking for. I've got an intranet based reporting tool (VB.Net+ASP.Net Integrated Windows Authentication) that looks up users and managers from a SQL server (2005) table to roll up the reporting to manager level. 

This table is currently manually maintained and I've been asked to make it more dynamic as it is going to be up-scaled for far more users. Therefore I'm looking to link in with the Active Directory to create an Org table in the back end which will replace the current manually entered one.

I'm comfortable getting user data from the AD, but not so sure as to the best approach to set this up, I was thinking of the following table:

    CREATE TABLE dbo.Employees
    (
    	EmpID		nvarchar(8)	PRIMARY KEY,
    	EmpName		nvarchar(30),
    	EmpNo		nvarchar(15),
    	EmpEmail	nvarChar(255),
    	EmpTitle	nvarchar(255),
    	MgrID		nvarchar(8)	FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Employees(EmpID)
    )
    GO

EmpID will be the NetworkID (sAMAccountName).

Then this will need populating from the AD, I'm guessing through recursive calls to fill in the fields. 

I'm then not sure how to structure the code so that it will capture every employee under every manager starting at a given level. 

I'm currently using the below to capture the direct reports for a given manager:

     Public Function GetDirectReports(ByVal ADFullName As String) As ArrayList
    
                Dim adItems As ArrayList = New ArrayList
    
                Dim rootEntry As New DirectoryEntry(""LDAP://"" & ADFullName)
    
                Dim searcher As New DirectorySearcher(rootEntry)
                searcher.PropertiesToLoad.Add(""directReports"")
                searcher.PropertiesToLoad.Add(""sAMAccountName"")
                searcher.PropertiesToLoad.Add(""cn"")
    
                searcher.PageSize = 5

    Option Strict On
    Option Explicit On
    
    Module Module1
    
        Sub Main()
            Dim thisShouldBeSet = False

            action.Invoke()

I know that the code in itself is flawed because I must use :

    DoSomething(Sub() thisShouldBeSet = True)

Instead of:

    DoSomething(Function() thisShouldBeSet = True)

I completely understand that the WCF Service doesn't run like a Windows service.  What I mean is that, once we ping the service, it'll run fine for a few minutes.

I'm using the following technologies : 

- VB.net
- Framework 3.5
- SQL Express 2005

The SQL I'm trying to execute is mostly straight-forwards but my app is completely unaware of the schema or the data contained within.  For example : 

    UPDATE mytable SET mycol2='data' WHERE mycol1=1
    INSERT INTO mytable (mycol1, mycol2) VALUES (1,'data')
    UPDATE mytable SET mycol2='data' WHERE mycol1=2
    INSERT INTO mytable (mycol1, mycol2) VALUES (1,'data')
    UPDATE mytable SET mycol2='data' WHERE mycol1=3

The above is a sample of the sort of thing I'm executing, but these files will contain around 10,000 to 20,000 statements each.

My problem is that when using sqlCommand.ExecuteNonQuery(), I get an exception raised because the second INSERT statement will hit the Primary Key constraint on the table.  

I need to know that this error happened and log it, but also process any subsequent statements.  I've tried wrapping these statements in TRY/CATCH blocks but I can't work out a way to handle the error then continue to process the other statements.  

The Query Analyser seems to behave in this way, but not when using sqlCommand.ExecuteNonQuery().

So is there a T-SQL equivalent of 'Resume Next' or some other way I can do this without introducing massive amounts of string handling on my part?

The SettingsTable.Create() method generates a bunch of Labels and TextBoxes based on the contents of the application settings and adds them to the SettingsTable.

When I click on the ViewSettingsPanel checkbox, I get a cross-thread violation error.  Any ideas?  I would really appreciate it.

One development approach which I have found useful in the past with projects that only entailed a single embedded processor was develop the code using Visual Studio, divided into three portions:
<ol>
<li>Main application code (in unmanaged C/C++ [see note])
<li>I/O-simulating code (C/C++) that runs under Visual Studio
<li>Embedded I/O code (C), which Visual Studio is instructed not to build, runs on the target system.  Previously this code was for the PIC; for most future projects I'm migrating to the ARM.
</ol>
Feeding the embedded compiler/linker the code from parts 1 and 3 yields a hex file that can run on the target system.  Running parts 1 and 2 together yields code which can run on the PC, with the benefit of better debugging tools and more precise control over I/O behavior (e.g. I can make the simulation code introduce certain types of random hiccups more easily than I can induce controlled hiccups on real hardware).

Target code is written in C, but the simulation environment uses C++ so as to simulate I/O registers.  For example, I have a PortArray data structure; the header file for the embedded compiler includes a line like `unsigned char LATA @ 0xF89;` and my header file for simulation includes `#define LATA _IOBIT(f89,1)` which in turn invokes a macro that accesses a suitable property of an I/O object, so a statement like `LATA |= 4;` will read the simulated latch, ""or"" the read value with 4, and write the new value.  To make this work, the target code has to compile under C++ as well as under C, but this mostly isn't a problem.  The biggest annoyance is probably with `enum` types (which behave as integers in C, but have to be coaxed to do so in C++).

Previously, I've used two approaches to making the simulation interactive:
<ol><li>Compile and link a DLL with target-application and simulation code, and have VB code in the same project which interacts with it.
<li>Compile the target-application code and some simulation code to an EXE with instance of Visual Studio, and use a second instance of Visual Studio for the simulation-UI.  Have the two programs communicate via TCP, so nearly all ""real"" I/O logic is in the simulation program.  For example, the aforementioned `LATA |= 4;` would send a ""read port 0xF89"" command to the TCP port, get the response, process the received value, and send a ""write port 0xF89"" command with the result.</ol>

I've found the latter approach to run a tiny bit slower than the former in some cases, but it seems much more convenient for debugging, since I can suspend execution of the unmanaged simulation code while the simulation UI remains responsive.  Indeed, for simulating a single target device at a time, I think the latter approach works extremely well.  My question is how I should best go about simulating a plurality of target devices (e.g. 16 of them).

The difficulty I have is figuring out how to make each simulated instance get its own set of global variables.  If I were to compile to an EXE and run one instance of the EXE for each simulated target device, that would work, but I don't know any practical way to maintain debugger support while doing that.  Another approach would be to arrange the target code so that everything would compile as one module joined together via `#include`.  For simulation purposes, everything could then be wrapped into a single C++ class, with global variables turning into class-instance variables.  That would be a bit more object-oriented, but I really don't like the idea of forcing all the application code to live in one compiled and linked module.

What would perhaps be ideal would be if the code could load multiple instances of the DLL, each with its own set of global variables.  I have no idea how to do that, however, nor do I know how to make things interact with the debugger.  I don't think it's really necessary that all simulated target devices actually execute code simultaneously; it would be perfectly acceptable for simulation instances to use cooperative multitasking.  If there were some way of finding out what range of memory holds the global variables, it might be possible to have the 'task-switch' method swap out all of the global variables used by the previously-running instance and swap in the contents applicable to the instance being switched in.  Although I'd know how to do that in an embedded context, though, I'd have no idea how to do that on the PC.

</html>",vb.net,,,,,08/05/2011 04:00:40,too localized,1,7227,6,"VB.NET How to add Search button I am developing an ASPX VB.NET file using SSMS 2008.  I need to add a search textbox so that users can filter SQL records on one of the columns.  I have been working on this several hours and although I have the SQL records returning correctly now, the search functionality is not working.  I do not get error messages from this code, but it is not filtering either.  My main problem now is how to get the text entered by user into my ""Main2"" sub?
