I'm wondering whether to begin focusing my (somewhat limited) time and energy on a single language, or to begin emphasizing one or two while continuing my current strategy of familiarizing myself with the basic syntax, data structures, and strengths of a number of different languages and paradigms before honing in on a particular language at which to gain core competency. 

Some background: I'm in my mid-thirties, still learn quickly and enjoy doing so, and have taken a couple of basic and intermediate college C++ courses scattered over the last five years (as well as Basic and Pascal in public school), but never pursued it seriously outside of class. Since beginning to spend all of my spare time studying a few months ago, I've reviewed C++ fundamentals, learned the basics of C and Java through textbooks, tutorials, and practice, and have lately spent a good deal of time studying JavaScript (both as a general programming language--including its OOP functionality--and in its more common use as a DOM scripting language in conjunction with HTML and CSS, both of which I've studied in some depth). I've also completed all of the code exercises and projects in Google Code University's [Python class][1] and have finished a few other Python (and Ruby) tutorials as well. Finally, I've been working through the (legendary or notorious) old MIT intro to programming course [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Languages][2] and its wonderful eponymous textbook, which utilize Scheme--a functional language and LISP variant--as much as time allows.

If I were twenty, I think I would first thoroughly learn Scheme through SICP (as I've been advised by some pretty hard-core, ""real men use emacs"" graybeards), then C in conjunction with Linux utilities and shell-scripting, then move on to higher-level and OOP languages. Since this would likely take me years and I'd like to get my career going ASAP, I'm looking for an approach that will allow me to develop enough expertise in some particular skill set to be marketable as an entry-level developer (with no degree and no real professional experience), while not focusing so much on a particular language or paradigm (procedural or object-oriented, C or Java or Objective C or Ruby/Rails) that my aging brain calcifies and and has difficulty adjusting to new concepts.

To be clear: I'm wondering whether it would benefit me in the medium/long-run to just focus my energies on a currently marketable language and its frameworks and start working on a serious portfolio in said language and spend my spare time learning others after I'm employed, or to take another few months to become competent at several and study theory and review review my math skills before potentially locking myself in.

 - Strong type system. One of my favorite parts of programming in Haskell is writing type declarations.

 - Emphasis on recursion rather than iteration. I use iterative constructs in Haskell, but implement them recursively.

Those applications doesn't need to be optimized but they need to be optimizable if required. What tools/languages/libraries should he learn?

**EXAMPLES:** 
For instance that person would/could need:

- True object oriented base (I think that is the name) - he needs to, for instance: get all instances of a class calling Class.instances, modify a Class in runtime - also, retrieve a reference to the Class object of a instance calling instance.type and being able to compare between classes like:
*myBird.type.isChildrenOf(Animal) //compares if type of myBird instance is inherited from Animal*. Other features like keeping track of past states of instances, for instance, 
    *if (last(pos)=[3,0,0]) then //checks if last state of vector pos was [3,0,0]*
and automatically synchronizing instances between different applications, for instance, 
    *game = create Game; //creates instance of class Game
    game.syncronize(""www.mygame.com"",51320); //syncronizes ""game"" instance to that hosted by ""www.mygame.com"" on port 51320.  *

- Good mathematical base including types that represent 2d/3d vertexes, matrixes, mathematical functions, geometric objects. Even better if every other library was actually based on that mathematical base, for instance, if every function of the other libraries that requires a xy pair could receive just a 2d vertex instead of 2 integers/floats. I would love it even more if there was no ""integer"", ""float"" etc but rather a type ""number"" with arbitrary precision and support for complex numbers. Methods to integrate, rotate 3d meshes, check for interceptions etc. would be nice.

- Great array support, including the hability to create them without lots of code. Arrays that resize automatically, that aren't bound to specific types, that are smart enough to use the proper internal representation based on what the programmer users. Functions to sort, loop though all elements, find elements based on their variables, for instance
    *(array.search(type=Bird,|velocity|>[3]) to search for all elements of array whose type is Bird and modulus of velocity > 3)*.

- Multi-threading support including smart threads that avoid inconsistency by themselves in an easy manner. Even better if the whole language was based in multi-threading. For instance, a ""*foreach <x> in <y> do <f>*"" that automatically creates a thread running function f for each instance x in array y and returns the threads created; or a ""when <expression> do <f>"" that will run the function <f> whenever during the execution of the program <expression> comes true.

- Really huge 2d graphics support, including functions to render texts, geometric forms, sprites, apply effects, etc., on a bitmap. Support for plotting graphics of mathematical functions. Support for GUI.

- Good 3d graphics support including functions to load, modify and save 3d meshes in many formats and render them in different projections modes without the programmer having to worry about more advanced topics (but giving the options to do so).

- Huge networking support including the capacity of stabilishing TCP connections, sending UDP messages, make a HTTP request. It would also be cool a feature to simulate a browser including rendering html, css, etc., pages, running javascript.

- Objects to work with databases like Mysql, to work with files.

- You got the point. BUT, NOTE!
1: It doesn't have to be a specific language or library - it can be any combination of languages and libraries if they enable that person of making it's job. 
2: It doesn't have to have ALL features on start. If it just has lots of libraries and a fast method for searching and installing them, that counts. But note that, for basic things like a strong array/objects/mathematic base, it is very important that they are built-in in the language or else the libraries won't integrate. For instance, there are libraries for everything in C++, but whenever I need, for instance, to draw a point on screen using allegro [graphics library] I have to write something like point(x1,x2). But the points of my programs are usually represented as 2d vertexes. Now if I have a function that expects a reference to a function that accepts a vector:
    *function f(&function(vector) f)*
I would have to write a wrapper for the function point so I can send it to f. It becomes a big problem when I find myself having to write wrappers for every function of an entire library when I need to integrate them to the remaining of my program. Also, for instance. I found the library Wild Magic 5 to compute geometry stuff, and the library Ogre3d to do 3d rendering stuff. Both libraries contains different representations of 3d vectors, though. So if I wish to use a result from Wild Magic on Ogre3d I have to make a conversion. That problem, when many many libraries are used, become a huge problem.

So this is it. Sorry if I wrote too much but I've learned programming and realized all those problems I'm having with the use of libraries. The time I take to make a new program is enourm either because C++ lacks many features, is coustly to write and because finding and installing libraries there is very time consuming (I don't know if I'm doing it right, though). Any light and advises from you more advanced programs is welcome.

Of course most of you use a high level framework in day to day programming (which are fine to use in answers) but sometimes it's nice to know how to do it at a low level too.

I myself know how to do it in `C`, `C++` and `Objective-C`, but it sure would be handy to see how it's done in all of the popular languages, if only to help us make a better decision about what language to do our file io in. In particular I think it would be interesting to see how its done in the string manipulation languages, like: `python`, `ruby` and of course `perl`.

So I figure here we can create a ***community resource*** that we can all ***star*** to our profiles and refer to when we need to do **file I/O** in some new language. Not to mention the exposure we will all get to languages that we don't deal with on a day to day basis.

**This is how you need to answer:**

 1. Create a new text file called ""**fileio.txt**""
 2. Write the first line ""hello"" to the text file.
 3. Write the second line ""world"" to the text file.
 4. Read the second line ""world"" into an input string.
 5. Print the input string to the console.

No particular limit on the language.
`C`, `C++`, `C#`, `Java`, `Objective-C` are all great.

The distribution of languages used throughout the competition can be seen [here][2].

After programming in C/C++ for several years, I recently fell in love with Python for its readable/straightforward nature. More recently, I learned functional languages like OCaml, Scheme, and even logic languages like Prolog. These languages certainly have their merits and, in my opinion, can be applied more easily than C++ and Java for certain situations. For example, Scheme's use of call/cc simplifies backtracking (a tool required to answer several problems) and Prolog's logic specification, although inefficient due to its brute-force nature, can drastically simplify (and even automatically solve) certain problems that are difficult to wrap one's brain around.

It is clear that a competition contestant should use the tools that are best suited for the challenge. Even x86 assembly is Turing complete - that doesn't justify solving problems with it. In this case, **why are the contestants that use less common languages like Scheme/Lisp, Prolog, and even Python significantly less successful than contestants that use C/C++ and Java?** Worded differently, **why don't successful contestants use languages that, although may be less mainstream, are arguably better tools for the job?**

There are several motivations for my question. Most importantly, I would like to become a better programmer - both in the practical aspect and the competition aspect. After being introduced to such beautiful paradigms like functional and logic programming, it is discouraging to see so many people discard them in favor of C/C++ and Java. It even makes me question my admiration for said paradigms, worrying that I cannot be successful as a Lisp/Scheme/Prolog programmer in a programming competition.

Jason [argues](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/309300/defend-php-convince-me-it-isnt-horrible) that ""Case insensitivity introduces much ambiguity"". I don't agree. If you realize that the language is case insensitive you know that `WHILE` means the same thing as `while`, even if you never write the former. Same for variables and functions; camel casing is nice, but was the first letter also a capital or not? And what about functions whose name starts with an underscore? In case insensitive languages no problem: `_fooBar` will do just as nicely as `_FooBar`. So where's the ambiguity Jason refers to? Yes, you can write a variable in different ways, but the meaning is unambiguous! `FooBar` == `foobar`!
  
In the same thread Delnan [says](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/309300/defend-php-convince-me-it-isnt-horrible/3900114#3900114) that `Capitalization is the difference between ""I had to help my uncle Jack off a horse.."" and ""I had to help my uncle jack off a horse..""`. Very clever :-). But rather a point against than pro case sensitivity: would you accept that your code goes haywire because of a single capitalization error? Again, in a case insensitive language, if `Jack` is a person, so is `jack`.  
  
**Question**: is there anyone who uses this feature in case sensitive languages that you can define two different variables or functions just by different capitalization? Because that's the only advantage I can see in it. Sure, you'll say, I write the variable name with camel casing and the constant all uppercase. But IMO they're incompatible; `userName` as a variable makes sense, but `USERNAME` as a constant doesn't.
