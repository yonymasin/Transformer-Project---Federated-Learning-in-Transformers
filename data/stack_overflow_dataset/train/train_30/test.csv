1. Should I begin writing the full specification and then implement, or write them both all along?
2. I'm still doubting between C and C++. C++ would allow for more clean design and faster development while C would (maybe) ensure portability to more platforms (microprocessors?). Performance is a must.
3. Should I try to interest people for the project before the first working prototype so they can cooperate (the end product will be a liberal license anyway), or keep working alone until I have something that runs?
4. How modular should it be? I am sure that I won't immediately start working on a bytecode interpreter but something easier to implement but slower thing first, so modularity is a must in order to be able to extend later, but I guess overdoing it will hamper performance and clearity.

I am the ""IT Manager"" (read: sole IT person) for a tiny company with 5 other employees including the owners.  As such, I'm in charge of everything that goes on as it relates to technology.  I am in the process of initiating a complete, ground-up rewrite of our existing ERP system, which was hacked together using VBScript and SQL Server about 5 years ago and is quite literally a cesspit of horrible code and bad practices.

Let me first say that the business I work for is incredibly cheap, and my budget to do anything is pretty much $0.00; I cannot hire additional people to help me out (unless I want to send modules to a site called AffordableProgrammers.com that outsources to India for $10/hour), and I cannot requisition any technology components.  I don't even have a copy of Visual Studio in the office (not that I need one, since all the current maintenance work is done in Classic ASP).  Our company has a single license of SQL Server 2005 that runs our database(s) but it runs on a two-processor server because the company won't pay for an additional license, saying the $5,000 price tag is ""ridiculous"" and that they already spent $5,000 on one license.

My programming skills are, I admit, mediocre at best.  I know a little C# but haven't touched it in around 2 years; most of my day job right now is either patching stuff in the terrible VBScript code or writing SQL queries to aggregate/load/query data.  Before I get too into architecting a new database schema and gathering requirements for the new application, I need to determine what technology stack I'm going to use.  The biggest issue here, of course, is that I have zero budget since my boss(es) are unwilling to spend money even on something relatively trivial.

I'm not terribly proficient in any programming language, really - 95% of my career has just been doing maintenance of existing programs, and I've never been in a situation where I can actually develop a brand new application from the ground up, **my** way.  I'm not sure which route to take as far as picking a technology stack, because once I choose one I want to stay with it.  While the logical course of action would be to use ASP.NET/C#, the application cannot be scaled properly due to zero funds to get additional equipment; for instance I would like (and we really need) to have a small data warehouse spun off of the OLTP database (the current database mixes the two together and runs slow as molasses because of it) for reporting, but with .NET and SQL Server this would require at least another $7,000 or so which just isn't available for use.  The benefit of course is an easy-to-use interface, since a *lot* of my activities involve importing data from Excel and manipulating them via SQL Server - it's something I want to get away from and implement some actual workflow processes, but we routinely have tight deadlines due to the fact we update our product listings every 3 months; our main (only) customer is the government and we are only allowed to update our prices quarterly, so each quarter is a rush to get data updated, processed and loaded.

My options here seem very limited, and compounded more by the fact that I'm by no means an expert at programming (I admit I'm trying to improve my programming skill).  I've been increasingly looking at open source to cut costs without sacrificing efficiency at the hardware and application level, but I'm still a little reluctant to do it on the software level even though the price is right for my bosses because I would have to learn a new list of technologies simultaneous with writing an ERP application (although even with that, I would be able to write it better than my predecessor) for what I call a ""VSE"" - Very Small Enterprise (as we are a really small business but require a lot of ""big boy"" features).  I have too many choices that can fit the bill, but the one logical choice is nearly ruled out because it costs money that the company is not willing to spend, no matter the benefit they would obtain.  Technically speaking, I own an MSDN subscription but I can't use the stuff included in that for work (as it's licensed to me as a person and I'm an employee of the company, not a consultant) and even so I couldn't use it for production systems.

Should I look at and evaluate open source technology stacks, since I know for a fact I won't be able to requisition any money to spend on new development?  At this point in time I can't just up and leave the job, either, I'm stuck for the foreseeable future and I want to make a difference at this small company that has never had a knowledgeable technology person who wants to automate/document/do things properly.",programming-languages,technologies,,,,05/10/2012 09:52:58,not constructive,1,854,10,"Choosing a technology stack for a small 'budget conscious' business This is tangentially related to my previous question regarding using a ""fringe"" technology.

I'm not sure which route to take as far as picking a technology stack, because once I choose one I want to stay with it.  While the logical course of action would be to use ASP.NET/C#, the application cannot be scaled properly due to zero funds to get additional equipment; for instance I would like (and we really need) to have a small data warehouse spun off of the OLTP database (the current database mixes the two together and runs slow as molasses because of it) for reporting, but with .NET and SQL Server this would require at least another $7,000 or so which just isn't available for use.  The benefit of course is an easy-to-use interface, since a *lot* of my activities involve importing data from Excel and manipulating them via SQL Server - it's something I want to get away from and implement some actual workflow processes, but we routinely have tight deadlines due to the fact we update our product listings every 3 months; our main (only) customer is the government and we are only allowed to update our prices quarterly, so each quarter is a rush to get data updated, processed and loaded.

My options here seem very limited, and compounded more by the fact that I'm by no means an expert at programming (I admit I'm trying to improve my programming skill).  I've been increasingly looking at open source to cut costs without sacrificing efficiency at the hardware and application level, but I'm still a little reluctant to do it on the software level even though the price is right for my bosses because I would have to learn a new list of technologies simultaneous with writing an ERP application (although even with that, I would be able to write it better than my predecessor) for what I call a ""VSE"" - Very Small Enterprise (as we are a really small business but require a lot of ""big boy"" features).  I have too many choices that can fit the bill, but the one logical choice is nearly ruled out because it costs money that the company is not willing to spend, no matter the benefit they would obtain.  Technically speaking, I own an MSDN subscription but I can't use the stuff included in that for work (as it's licensed to me as a person and I'm an employee of the company, not a consultant) and even so I couldn't use it for production systems.

Should I look at and evaluate open source technology stacks, since I know for a fact I won't be able to requisition any money to spend on new development?  At this point in time I can't just up and leave the job, either, I'm stuck for the foreseeable future and I want to make a difference at this small company that has never had a knowledgeable technology person who wants to automate/document/do things properly.",2

There are also some negatives, like I felt it is more inclined towards .NET/Microsoft technologies.

I don't care if it is more focused on any one platform like above (I still enjoy the read a lot... ). Any suggestions?
