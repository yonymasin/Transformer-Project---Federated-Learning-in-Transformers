Question was asked here:

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5630363/find-two-elements-in-an-array-that-sum-to-k

Basically: Unsorted array, find if two elements sum to k.

An answer was posted claiming that there is no O(n) solution, quoting element distinctness.

Seems like the reduction might work:

Given an array A of which we need to find if two elements repeat, find max. Form another array B[j] = 2*max + 1 - B[j]. Now try to find two which sum to 2*max+1 in the combined array A,B.

Since element distinct needs nlogn, there can't be O(n) for this problem too (last step in above reduction).

Now given the _zero_ votes (and comments) to that answer, I am thinking that is wrong (or do votes mean nothing on this site?)

The top answer is incorrect as hash table is n in the worst case. So that is n^2 in the worst case, which is kind of ridiculous to have so many votes and the green tick.

(I search for an algorithm)

Example:

    Array : [ 1 , 5 , 4 , 9 , 6 ]
    Average : ( 1 + 5 + 4 + 9 + 6 ) / 5 = 5
    Distance Array : [|1-5|, |5-5|, |4-5|, |9-5|, |6-5|] = [4 , 0 , 1 , 4 , 1 ]
    Average Distance : ( 4 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 1 ) / 5 = 2

The simple algorithm needs 2 passes.

1st pass) Reads and accumulates values, then divides the result by array length to calculate average value of array elements.

2nd pass) Reads values, accumulates each one's distance from the previously calculated average value, and then divides the result by array length to find the average distance of the elements from the average value of the array.

The two passes are identical. It is the classic algorithm of calculating the average of a set of values. The first one takes as input the elements of the array, the second one the distances of each element from the array's average value.

Calculating the average can be modified to not accumulate the values, but caclulating the average ""on the fly"" as we sequentialy read the elements from the array.

The formula is:

    Compute Running Average of Array's elements
    -------------------------------------------
    RA[i] = E[i] {for i == 1}
    RA[i] = RA[i-1] - RA[i-1]/i + A[i]/i { for i > 1 }

Where A[x] is the array's element at position x, RA[x] is the average of the array's elements between position 1 and x (running average).

My question is:

Is there a similar algorithm, to calculate ""on the fly"" (as we read the array's elements), the average distance of the elements from the array's mean value?

The problem is that, as we read the array's elements, the final average value of the array is not known. Only the running average is known. So calculating differences from the running average will not yield the correct result.

    Distance Array : [|1-5|, |5-5|, |4-5|, |9-5|, |6-5|] = [4 , 0 , 1 , 4 , 1 ]
    Average Distance : ( 4 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 1 ) / 5 = 2

The simple algorithm needs 2 passes.

1st pass) Reads and accumulates values, then divides the result by array length to calculate average value of array elements.

2nd pass) Reads values, accumulates each one's distance from the previously calculated average value, and then divides the result by array length to find the average distance of the elements from the average value of the array.

The two passes are identical. It is the classic algorithm of calculating the average of a set of values. The first one takes as input the elements of the array, the second one the distances of each element from the array's average value.

Calculating the average can be modified to not accumulate the values, but caclulating the average ""on the fly"" as we sequentialy read the elements from the array.

The formula is:

    Compute Running Average of Array's elements
    -------------------------------------------
    RA[i] = E[i] {for i == 1}
    RA[i] = RA[i-1] - RA[i-1]/i + A[i]/i { for i > 1 }

Where A[x] is the array's element at position x, RA[x] is the average of the array's elements between position 1 and x (running average).

My question is:

Is there a similar algorithm, to calculate ""on the fly"" (as we read the array's elements), the average distance of the elements from the array's mean value?

The problem is that, as we read the array's elements, the final average value of the array is not known. Only the running average is known. So calculating differences from the running average will not yield the correct result. I suppose, if such algorithm exists, it probably should have the ""ability"" to compensate, in a way, on each new element read for the error calculated as far.",5

    $sue[butter][] = 2;
    $sue[toothpaste] = array(); 
    $sue[toothpaste][] = 1;
    $john[peach] = array(); 
    $john[peach][] = 1;
    $john[banana] = array(); 
    $john[banana][] = 1;

My current code can only record the item and the item quantity.

	
	public $items = array();
	
	public function AddItem($product_id)
	{
		if (array_key_exists($product_id , $this->items))
		{
			$this->items[$product_id] = $this ->items[$product_id] + 1;
		} else {
			$this->items[$product_id] = 1;
		}
	}

I just dont know how to put this inside an array for each person.

Thanks!",2

      g_a_cache[$l_i_array_index]=$line
      let ""l_i_array_index += 1""
      done < $g_f_cache

2) Then I run a little benchmark for the search performance:

    time for i in `seq 1 100`
      do
      for l_i_array_index in `seq 1 ${#g_a_cache[@]}`
        do
          echo ${g_a_cache[$l_i_array_index]}
        done | grep -c $l_s_search_string > /dev/null
      done

    real	0m14.387s
    user	0m13.846s
    sys		0m1.781s

3) The same, but directly from disk file:

    time for i in `seq 1 100`
      do
      grep -c $l_s_search_string $g_f_cache > /dev/null
      done
    real	0m0.347s
    user	0m0.161s
    sys		0m0.136s

So performance is 13 to 40 times worse, when it should be better.

**My question is: 1)** what is the reason for this strange behaviour **2)** is this solvable within bash or should I bite the bullet and finally redo it in Python

P.S. The test is done on Mac (bash v4), in Cygwin, time per ONE search is over a second with normal grep (which is faster), and over 10s with the array method. The script is close to unusable..",3

Some languages, such as pascal, provide this by default, e.g., you can create an array such as

    var foobar: array[1..10] of string;

I've always been wondering: Why would you want to have the array index not to start with 0? 

I guess it may be more familiar for beginners to have arrays starting with 1 and the last index being the size of the array, but on a long-term basis, programmers should get used to values starting with 0. 

Another purpose I could think of: In some cases, the index could actually represent something thats contained in the respective array-entry. e.g., you want to get all capital letters in an array, it may be handy to have an index being the ASCII-Code of the respective letter. But its pretty easy just to subtract a constant value. In this example, you could (in C) simply do something like this do get all capital letters and access the letter with ascii-code 67:

    #define ASCII_SHIFT 65
    main()
    {
        int capital_letters[26];
        int i;
        for (i=0; i<26; i++){
            capital_letters[i] = i+ASCII_SHIFT;
        }   
        printf(""%c\n"", capital_letters[67-ASCII_SHIFT]);
    }
Also, I think you should use hash tables if you want to access entries by some sort of key.

Someone might retort: Why should the index always start with 0? Well, it's a hell of a lot simpler this way. You'll be faster when you just have to type one index when declaring an array. Also, you can always be sure that the first entry is array[0] and the last one is array[length_of_array-1]. It is also common that other data structures start with 0. e.g., if you read a binary file, you start with the 0th byte, not the first. 

Now, why do some programming languages have this ""feature"" and why do some people ask how to achieve this in languages such as C/C++?, is there any situation where an array starting with a nonzero index is way more useful, or even, something simply cannot be done with an array starting at 0?",arrays,indexing,index,indexes,,,open,0,414,9,"What's the purpose of arrays starting with nonzero index?

I am getting an ArrayIndexOutOfBounds error whenever I have more than one line of input. For example:

b


It's occurring in the createTree method, but I can't pinpoint why. The preorderTraversal method doesn't seem to be running either even when I have only one line of input as I get no output from running the program, but I don't know why. Can anyone help me please?

cell.textLabel.text = [cat valueForKey:@""reference""];

There is another array “data” that prints out the content to the debug console and I want to populate another view with this content. But I am having lot of trouble populating the next view with the data array.

Whenever I have needed to make a multidimensional array, my naming has always placed the counter in the first element.

For example, if I have a single dimensional array as follows:

	$myArray['year']=2012;
	$myArray['month']='July';
	$myArray['measure']=3;
	// and so on.

However, if I wanted to make that same array keep a few years of history I would add another dimension and format it as follows:

	$myArray[$year]['year']=2012;
	$myArray[$year]['month']='July';
	$myArray[$year]['measure']=3;
	
Now, my question is about accepted convention. Should I instead be doing the following?

	$myArray['year'][$year]=2012;
	$myArray['month'][$year]='July';
	$myArray['measure'][$year]=3;

I have searched about array naming conventions, but keep hitting articles arguing about whether to name arrays as plurals or not. The way I have been naming them seems to be more logical and I think it follows a structure that resembles an object better i.e. object->secondaryLevel->detail but for all I know I have been doing it ass-about all this time.
