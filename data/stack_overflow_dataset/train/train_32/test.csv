I'm making a Battleship game and storing the board as an array that can hold 100 ints.

I need to loop through the player's array and convert the information stored in each 'cell' to graphical data for the purpose of displaying the board to the user.

My troubles stem from the fact that the characters being displayed to the user are based on what values are in each cell of the array.

If the value is 0 (empty) - print '[ ]', if 1 (guessed and empty) print - '[O]', and if 2 (guessed and hit) print - '[X]'.

So as I'm looping through each cell in the array, I need to check the value and branch to the appropriate print function.

My problem is that if I branch to the print statement, how do I jump back to where the branch statement was?

Pseudo code:
Looping through array, 'ArrayCell' = value at current array location
branch if equal ArrayCell, 0, print empty
branch if equal ArrayCell, 1, print miss
branch if equal ArrayCell, 2, print hit
increment array

print empty:
print then jump back to loop
print miss:
print then jump back to loop
print hit:
print then jump back to loop

How do you jump back to the branch statement after printing to preserve where you are in the array?

Many thanks!

1. What is the time complexity of array initialization in java? e.g.,

   I am guessing it to be O(n) or does the JVM invokes some crazy hardware voodoo magic that it takes only O(1)?

2. What about inserting or retrieving elements using array index?

    int getNumber(int arrIndex) {

   I am guessing this to be O(1). But say if arrIndex is 4999 then, wouldn't the pointer that is pointing to the head of the array calculates that the item to be retrieved is at head+(size of int)*arrIndex and 'moves' n (~5000) position to retrieve that item thus making the complexity O(n) and not O(1). 

   Perhaps we do not consider things at hardware level and conveniently call it the 'constant' associated with the time complexity? Could someone please clarify? Thanks!

It is obvious that i need to preserve order so. Number of columns and its metadata is dynamic and each XML may differ.

I need to transform this xml to EXCEL compatible file (I use urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office, urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:excel and urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:spreadsheet namespaces for it)

Problem is that I don't know how to apply information from head/heading elements dataType + dataFormat (if available) on row/column/value. This will help Excel to recognize which datatype is inside its cells.
It is obvious that i need to preserve order so. Number of columns and its metadata is dynamic and each XML may differ.

I need to get something like this:

In order to create the grid of data in the first place I used a very imperative style algorithm, shown below. The key feature it relies upon is that I can take an index into an array and create a reference out of it. An example, ""&array[x][y]"".

I need to be able to take an index into a mutable array and make a state reference out of it in Haskell. The type signature might therefore be

    convertToSTRef :: i -> STArray s i a -> ST s (STRef s a)

I have looked over the documentation, tried both hoogle and hayoo, and not found a way to accomplish this.

P.S. Alternatively, if someone had a different algorithm that I could use, that would be great.

P.S.S. The simple imperative algorithm.

    const size_t rows = 20;
    const size_t columns = 59;

    block tiles[columns][rows];
    block * const start = &tiles[columns/2][rows/2];

    for (size_t x = 0; x < columns; ++x)
     for (size_t y = 0; y < rows; ++y)
     {
      tiles[x][y].floor = '^';
      tiles[x][y].inhabitant = WALL;
      tiles[x][y].side_block[EAST] = (x + 1 < columns) ? &tiles[x + 1][y] : NULL;
      tiles[x][y].side_block[SOUTH] = (y + 1 < rows) ? &tiles[x][y + 1] : NULL;

In order to create the grid of data in the first place I used a very imperative style algorithm, shown below. The key feature it relies upon is that I can take an index into an array and create a reference out of it. An example, ""&array[x][y]"".

I need to be able to take an index into a mutable array and make a state reference out of it in Haskell. The type signature might therefore be

    convertToSTRef :: i -> STArray s i a -> ST s (STRef s a)

I have looked over the documentation, tried both hoogle and hayoo, and not found a way to accomplish this.

P.S. Alternatively, if someone had a different algorithm that I could use, that would be great.

P.S.S. The simple imperative algorithm.

    const size_t rows = 20;
    const size_t columns = 59;

    block tiles[columns][rows];
    block * const start = &tiles[columns/2][rows/2];

    for (size_t x = 0; x < columns; ++x)
     for (size_t y = 0; y < rows; ++y)
