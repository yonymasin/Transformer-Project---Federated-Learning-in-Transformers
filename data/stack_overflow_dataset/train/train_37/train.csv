Right now we're using SVN for version control and store code and assets in the same repository. Source versions of assets (models, textures) reside in a separate media branch, while the rendered versions of the assets (we're working on an isometric 2d game, so we actually use rendered 2d images of the 3d models in the game) reside close to the code, as they're needed to be in place to run the game.

Our artists had a hard time to get started with using Subversion and to wrap their head around the concept of version control in general. Right now the project mostly consists of programmers and we're considering to move from SVN to distributed version control to ease working with branches (and the associated merging process) and sending in patches. We haven't made a decision about which DVCS to use yet, but we will most likely end up using either Mercurial or Git.

While distributed version control is great for developers with a technical background, it might seem overly complex and complicated for artist and other prolly less tech savvy devs.

So I'm looking for all kinds of advice how we could ease the version control workflow for artists. Keep in mind that using something like Perforce, regardless of how suited it might be for the job, is not option for a free of charge open source project. So I'm pretty much rather looking for advice, tutorials, project tools that make it easy for artists to wrap their head around distributed version control, especially Hg and/or Git.

Is it even worth going down that route and try to get the artists using distributed version control? We could continue to store the source versions of assets (textures, models) in our existing SVN repository. But we would still have to find a solution for the assets that are needed to run the game, as they should reside close to the code in version control.

There are a bunch of great DVCS guides out there, e.g. the <a href=""http://hginit.com/"">Hginit tutorial</a>. However the ones I've found were all written for programmers. It's great that they can now easily locally commit, use the full potential of branches and merge back their changes without too much hassle. But this might not be beneficial for artists but rather overly complex and scary to them. Do you happen to know a DVCS tutorial that was written for artists as the primary target audience?

We need to figure out how to handle general code improvements / technical debt fixes that come up while working on a feature.

The workflow we have adopted is to use 'develop' as the main integration branch and develop all features on feature branches off of 'develop'.  When a feature is complete, the developer creates a pull request and everyone reviews it to provide comments before it is merged back into develop.  This seems to be working very well.

The issue we have is that during routine development on a feature, the developer may end up wanting to modify/refactor some common code to improve the system or clean up some technical debt.  This change is valuable, but not directly tied to the feature under development.

Based on our workflow, it should really be done on a different branch that goes through it's own pull request and code review before getting into develop.  If we have them do this though, how can they get the change back over onto their feature branch in the meantime while they wait for the full code review to happen and the code to get merged into develop.

The ideas we have are:

  1) cherry-pick the changes from the 'refactorX' branch into our feature branch.  Continue developing and let git (hopefully) figure out when we merge back to develop that it already has the change from the refactor branch.

  2) Merge the 'refactorX' branch into our feature branch and continue development.  (note: the branch off develop for 'refactorX' may have been later in the history of develop, so we think this may have problems)

  3) Some other smarter option we don't know yet. :)

What we are looking for is some best practice guidance on how to handle this part of the workflow.  After talking about it more we know that it will come up frequently and we want to find a smooth and efficient way to handle it in our workflow.

The workflow we have adopted is to use 'develop' as the main integration branch and develop all features on feature branches off of 'develop'.  When a feature is complete, the developer creates a pull request and everyone reviews it to provide comments before it is merged back into develop.  This seems to be working very well.

The issue we have is that during routine development on a feature, the developer may end up wanting to modify/refactor some common code to improve the system or clean up some technical debt.  This change is valuable, but not directly tied to the feature under development.

Based on our workflow, it should really be done on a different branch that goes through it's own pull request and code review before getting into develop.  If we have them do this though, how can they get the change back over onto their feature branch in the meantime while they wait for the full code review to happen and the code to get merged into develop.

The ideas we have are:

  1) cherry-pick the changes from the 'refactorX' branch into our feature branch.  Continue developing and let git (hopefully) figure out when we merge back to develop that it already has the change from the refactor branch.

  2) Merge the 'refactorX' branch into our feature branch and continue development.  (note: the branch off develop for 'refactorX' may have been later in the history of develop, so we think this may have problems)

  3) Some other smarter option we don't know yet. :)

What we are looking for is some best practice guidance on how to handle this part of the workflow.  After talking about it more we know that it will come up frequently and we want to find a smooth and efficient way to handle it in our workflow.

Then, I think I must have accidentally merged `versionB` back into `versionA`, which is not fine because `versionB` is *not* backwards-compatible to `versionA`.

If I were on Mercurial I'd do `hg rollback` and all would be fine, or I'd `hg update C'` and make future commits off there for the `versionA` branch, although this would leave `M2` as a dead dangling head (hence I'd prefer the `rollback` method).

There are several other developers who either commit to `master` or create other branches and later merge into `master`.

Let's say work on `test` is taking several days and you want to continuously keep `test` updated with commits inside `master`.

I would do `git pull origin master` from `test`. Question 1 is, is this the right approach? Other developers could have easily worked on same files as I have worked btw.

Now my work on `test` is done and I am ready to merge it back to `master`. Here are the two ways I can think of:

A:

    git checkout test
    git pull origin master
    git push origin test
    git checkout master
    git pull origin test 

B:

    git checkout test
    git pull origin master

Thank you for you time",git,,,,,,open,0,254,11,"Best (and safest) way to merge a git branch into master So let's assume on day 1 you create a new branch from `master` we call it `test`.

There are several other developers who either commit to `master` or create other branches and later merge into `master`.

Let's say work on `test` is taking several days and you want to continuously keep `test` updated with commits inside `master`.

I would do `git pull origin master` from `test`. Question 1 is, is this the right approach? Other developers could have easily worked on same files as I have worked btw.

Now my work on `test` is done and I am ready to merge it back to `master`. Here are the two ways I can think of:

A:

    git checkout test
    git pull origin master
    git push origin test
    git checkout master
    git pull origin test 

B:

    git checkout test
    git pull origin master
    git checkout master
    git merge test

We use feature branches to develop new features and then when we are done we submit a pull request on github to ask the other team members to perform a code review.  

This is all working great.  But on some of the code reviews we are having trouble because GitHub limits the amount of context surrounding the changes in the diff.  For example if someone makes a one line change in the middle of a class method, you can't see the full class method (or any of the other parts of the class) to make sure that they are not missing a corner case and are using the class internals correctly.

We used to use Trac for this type of thing and it had a very nice ability where you could adjust the number of lines to show around each change.

I have given up on using GitHub for this and am now looking for a GUI tool that will run on Linux that allows you to select a range of commits and see a single view of the combined changes from those commits.  (ie. provide a view similar to GitHub's pull request diff view).  Does anyone know where I can find something that will do this?

Yesterday, I copied the themes and plugins folders from our production server to the network file server.  I then opened the command line that comes with Git for Windows, navigated to the folder on the file server and did this for each theme and plugin to create a repository on the network:

    $ git init
    $ git add *
    $ git commit -m 'initial project version'

Then, on my workstation I navigated to the themes (and later plugins) folder and did this for each theme and plugin:

    $ git clone /path/to/network/repository

It cloned in the files and everything seemed like it was going smoothly.  Then, I tested a commit and tried pushing it back to the network file server.  This gave me an error saying that the file on the network was checked out.  After searching on web for what I was doing wrong, I discovered that maybe (I think) I should have created a bare repository on the network file server.  So, now I'm looking for someone who can tell me if I'm heading in the right direction or not.

From that, a bare repository will be created in a separate directory on the network file server.  The workstations will fetch and merge from the bare repository, then push back to it.  Then, the non-bare network repository will pull from the bare repository.  Next, the files will be manually copied from the non-bare network repository to the staging server to be tested.  After testing, our server admin will copy the changes from staging to production.

I'd like to include a source file (have it delivered when someone clones a repository) in my repository but have changes to it ignored by default.

`git update-index --assume-unchanged ...` doesn't work because it only applies to the local index.  I want all users to have the file in question ignored by default.

6112852,05/24/2011 15:25:00,370290,05/29/2010 12:45:41,83,13,my git website update strategy,"Here is my git-powered-website update and backup strategy.

I have SSH access to the Linux VPS where the website is hosted. Here is what I do:

1) AT THE WEBSITE SERVER - Create a git repo, at the proper website folder (one level before public root):

    cd /path/to/website
    git init
    git add -A
    git commit -m ""Website as of today.""

2) AT THE BACKUP SERVER - Create a mirror repo, for backup purposes, at another VPS:

    git clone --mirror ssh://user@example.com/path/to/website website_backup

Note: a mirror repo is also a bare repository (no checked out working tree).

3) SET UP CRONJOBS - One at the website server, to absorb wesbite file system changes (changes can be done by the scripts, by FTP, etc). It runs the following bash script, daily:

    #!/bin/bash
    date=$(date +%d/%m/%Y)
    cd /path/to/website
    git add -A -v
    git commit -m ""Changes done at to website at ${date}""
    exit 0

This way, the live website changes are stored directly to the repository master branch.

Another cronjob is set up at the backup server. It runs the following script daily, right after the website server cronjob above:

    #!/bin/bash
    cd /path/to/website_backup
    git fetch -u ssh://user@example.com/path/to/website
    exit 0

Cool! No matter what happens at the website server, I have at the backup server a daily updated backup, which is a git repo, allowing me to move backwards in time if necessary. I don't need to be afraid of losing stuff by accidental overwrites or deletions... and the whole process is automated! Daily, I receive a couple of e-mails from the cronjobs, allowing me to check what has been changed in the website, and to acknowledge that both cronjobs ran correctly. (I also have a cronjob set up to perform the database backup.)

4) SET UP DEVELOPMENT (LOCAL REPO + WORKING TREE) - I check out a copy directly from the website, and then create a new local branch called ""dev"":

    git clone ssh://user@example.com/path/to/website website_local
    git checkout -b dev

Now, I can play with the development branch, and do my work.

5) UPDATING THE WEBSITE - I simply push from my local development branch to the website repository:

    git push origin dev

Next, I need to use SSH and run, from the website folder, the git merge command:

    git merge dev

6) IMPROVING THE UPDATE PROCESS - To automatically run the merge, without needing to run the merge command from the server command line, add a post-receive hook to the website repository. Create the hook file, make it executable, and edit the file:

    touch /path/to/website/.git/hooks/post-receive
    chmod a+x /path/to/website/.git/hooks/post-receive
    pico /path/to/website/.git/hooks/post-receive

The contents of the post-receive hook file are:

    #!/bin/sh
    unset GIT_DIR
    cd /path/to/website
    echo ""Merging dev changes to master branch.""
    git merge --ff-only dev
    exit 0

Now, the main thing to notice is the **--ff-only** option added to the merge command. Why is it there? It is there because, being an automated process, we don't want to have merge conflicts stored to our live website files, do we? So, using this option, we enforce the merge to happen only if we have a clean fast-forward context. If this clean merge can't happen, then we may log in to the server, and manually resolve the case.

Additionally, there is something we may do to avoid merge conflicts at the server, trying to ensure a successfull fast-forward merge there, which is doing a merge from the website master to our dev branch (i.e., updating the dev branch with latest live website changes), prior to pushing our changes. It can be done like this:

    git pull origin master

But we can do even better:

    git checkout master
    git pull origin master
    git checkout dev
    git merge master

This way, our local master branch is kept in sync with the remote live website master branch. The merge is performed 100% locally.

7) BACK TO SIMPLICITY - Let's create an alias to facilitate things:

    git config alias.deploy '!git checkout master && git pull origin master && git checkout dev && git merge master && git push origin dev'

Now, we can perform the update by using the ""deploy"" alias, like this:

    git deploy

It will:

 1. Switch to local master branch
 2. Update the local master branch with the website latest committed changes
 3. Switch back to dev branch
 4. Merge the changes to the local dev branch
 5. Push the local dev branch to the remote website dev branch
 6. Having our post-receive hook properly set up at the server, it will automatically fast-forward the website repo, so our dev changes will be published to production!

    date=$(date +%d/%m/%Y)
    cd /path/to/website
    git add -A -v
    git commit -m ""Changes done at to website at ${date}""
    exit 0

This way, the live website changes are stored directly to the repository master branch.

Another cronjob is set up at the backup server. It runs the following script daily, right after the website server cronjob above:

    #!/bin/bash
    cd /path/to/website_backup
    git fetch -u ssh://user@example.com/path/to/website
    exit 0

Cool! No matter what happens at the website server, I have at the backup server a daily updated backup, which is a git repo, allowing me to move backwards in time if necessary. I don't need to be afraid of losing stuff by accidental overwrites or deletions... and the whole process is automated! Daily, I receive a couple of e-mails from the cronjobs, allowing me to check what has been changed in the website, and to acknowledge that both cronjobs ran correctly. (I also have a cronjob set up to perform the database backup.)

4) SET UP DEVELOPMENT (LOCAL REPO + WORKING TREE) - I check out a copy directly from the website, and then create a new local branch called ""dev"":

    git clone ssh://user@example.com/path/to/website website_local
    git checkout -b dev

Now, I can play with the development branch, and do my work.

5) UPDATING THE WEBSITE - I simply push from my local development branch to the website repository:

    git push origin dev

Next, I need to use SSH and run, from the website folder, the git merge command:

    git merge dev

6) IMPROVING THE UPDATE PROCESS - To automatically run the merge, without needing to run the merge command from the server command line, add a post-receive hook to the website repository. Create the hook file, make it executable, and edit the file:

    touch /path/to/website/.git/hooks/post-receive
    chmod a+x /path/to/website/.git/hooks/post-receive
    pico /path/to/website/.git/hooks/post-receive

The contents of the post-receive hook file are:

    #!/bin/sh
    unset GIT_DIR
    cd /path/to/website
    echo ""Merging dev changes to master branch.""
    git merge --ff-only dev
    exit 0

Now, the main thing to notice is the **--ff-only** option added to the merge command. Why is it there? It is there because, being an automated process, we don't want to have merge conflicts stored to our live website files, do we? So, using this option, we enforce the merge to happen only if we have a clean fast-forward context. If this clean merge can't happen, then we may log in to the server, and manually resolve the case.

Additionally, there is something we may do to avoid merge conflicts at the server, trying to ensure a successfull fast-forward merge there, which is doing a merge from the website master to our dev branch (i.e., updating the dev branch with latest live website changes), prior to pushing our changes. It can be done like this:

    git pull origin master

But we can do even better:

    git checkout master
    git pull origin master
    git checkout dev
    git merge master

This way, our local master branch is kept in sync with the remote live website master branch. The merge is performed 100% locally.

7) BACK TO SIMPLICITY - Let's create an alias to facilitate things:

    git config alias.deploy '!git checkout master && git pull origin master && git checkout dev && git merge master && git push origin dev'

Now, we can perform the update by using the ""deploy"" alias, like this:

    git deploy

It will:

 1. Switch to local master branch
 2. Update the local master branch with the website latest committed changes
 3. Switch back to dev branch
 4. Merge the changes to the local dev branch
 5. Push the local dev branch to the remote website dev branch
 6. Having our post-receive hook properly set up at the server, it will automatically fast-forward the website repo, so our dev changes will be published to production!

Now... the truth is that I answered my own question while writing the text above.
Do we have some sort of Wiki here at stackoverflow?
Not knowing what to do, and eager to share these contents, I will click the ""Post your question"" button anyway, hoping for the best outcome... thanks!

A directory named `rebase-apply` is created on conflicts, but it seems that it's an implementation detail which I cannot rely (e.g. in the past the directory had a different name).

The point is that when I check in a change on my mac local drive, I want it to go to the NAS drive.

I see that I need to run ""git init"" on my local Mac (Lion) to tell Git that the project is a working git repository.

But how do I tell it that the git server is on the Nas drive?

And how do I add my initial code into git? (It keeps telling me no files have been changed)

I have read the Git_book.pdf and some tutorials, but they don't seem to go back to these fundamentals.

Sorry for asking the basic questions, need a little hand holding til I get it up and running

Thanks!

That's *good*, right?  The file is altered in the work area, so it doesn't want to do a pull.

Now, I know I can accomplish this by rebasing topic1 and topic2 onto master, and I could even write a script to automate this. But what if I have several other branches, create new ones and delete others frequently and I receive upstream changes all the time?

This operation (several rebases), when done by hand, is both tiring and error-prone.

Is there a way of importing history of the files in the subtree repo into the project repo which I'm running under project_root? Ultimately, I'd really like to be able to look at a git log for any given file within the libraryx, rather than having a single merge commit which doesn't provide information specific to the file I'm interested in. 

Am I missing something simple here, or is this simply a limitation of using subtrees?",3

I've always heard that you should, at least as a beginner, do it my way; small commit messages often. You should, if possible, summarize your commit in one sentence.

But I get the opposite feeling when looking at pro's like [Linus Torvalds](http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds). Here is one commit message from him on the [subsurface](https://github.com/torvalds/subsurface) project on github.

> This makes it consider them to be identical if they are within half a
bar of each other.  If you edit the pressures by hand and set them to
the same bar pressure as the samples, they may not be identical to the
last milli-bar, but clearly the manually entered cylinder pressure isn't
significantly different from the sample data, so consider it redundant.  
We do want manual overrides of cylinder pressures to take precedence
over sample data (as Dirk so eloquently puts it, some dive computers
really don't have very reliable sample data), but at the same time the
sample data is the one we are expecting to be fairly accurate.  The
starting and ending pressure overrides are for when there is no sample
data, or when the sample data is totally wrong for some reason.

But I get the opposite feeling when looking at pro's like [Linus Torvalds](http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds). Here is one commit message from him on the [subsurface](https://github.com/torvalds/subsurface) project on github.

> This makes it consider them to be identical if they are within half a
bar of each other.  If you edit the pressures by hand and set them to
the same bar pressure as the samples, they may not be identical to the
last milli-bar, but clearly the manually entered cylinder pressure isn't
significantly different from the sample data, so consider it redundant.  
We do want manual overrides of cylinder pressures to take precedence
over sample data (as Dirk so eloquently puts it, some dive computers
really don't have very reliable sample data), but at the same time the
sample data is the one we are expecting to be fairly accurate.  The
starting and ending pressure overrides are for when there is no sample
data, or when the sample data is totally wrong for some reason.

[Here](https://github.com/torvalds/subsurface/commit/b4938ec2de87c3a43b749a1607d3bacb17d37cff) is the commit message in question.

I took a look at my own commit message (I've a few thousand of them) and they are most often always less than 40 characters.

Anyone got some input on the question?",5

My background (as related to this question):

  - Subversion user for 6+ years
  - Migrating to git per our office's new development processes
  - Using Github for code hosting

Here it is:

  - Github offers private repositories for a fee. The more private repos you have, the more it will cost. Also, the more cluttered your github account will become.
  - To use git ""properly"", one really should be creating a separate repo for each unrelated project. If unrelated projects have some sort of relationship in a final meta-project -- subdirectories in a web app, say, or some type of plugin relationship -- then the recommendation I've seen is to use **git submodules**.
  - In Subversion, I'd have nominally related projects in a single repository, and create separate svn subdirectories for each project, with svn-recommended directory layouts in each project (i.e. Repo/Project/[branches/tags/trunk])

The example real-world situation is this:

 1. 1 large pile of scripts/utilities we use for operations. (Collect data, check status of a customers stuff, etc.)
 2. 1 set of utilities I've written to interact with the web services offered by a vendor we use (CRM SaaS vendor)
 3. 1 web front end that mixes some of the web services stuff I just listed, plus some stuff from the operations utils pile, plus some other stuff. (This provides a way for my users to access the data the tools from (1) and (2) have collected)

These three sets of code are related, in that they touch some of the same data and resources, but really are separate projects that do different things.

 - distribute config files suffixed with, for example, `_original` while having the real files in `.gitignore`. Each developer then renames files to real names
     - files are available for anyone who clones repo
     - one has to search for all configs throughout application and rename them

Are there any other, possibly, better ways to handle this? I suspect I'm missing something, some plugin at least.",1

This visualization is currently done by reading commits which are emitted from git in the correct order. For each commit the parents are known, so it's fairly easy to build up the lanes in the correct way.

I'd like to speed up this process by using my own commit pool and linearizing the commits myself. This allows me to reuse existing loaded commits and allows git to emit commits faster because it doesn't have to emit them in the correct order.

However, I'm not sure what algorithm to use to accomplish this. It is important that the building is incremental, as the loading of commits can take a long time (>5 seconds for 100,000 commits, which should all be displayed).

Gitk has gone the same way, and there's a patch [here][3] that shows how it is implemented, but my TCL skills are weak and the patch isn't very thoroughly commented and a bit hard to follow.

I'd also like this algorithm to be efficient, as it'll have to handle hundreds of thousands of commits. It also has to be displayed in a table, so it's important that access to specific rows is fast.

I'll describe the input I have so far, the output that I want and a few observations.

Input:

* I have a current pool of commits in the form of a hash table that maps commit ids to commit objects. This pool does not have to be complete (have all commits necessary)
* I have a separate thread loading in new commits from git, with a callback that can be called every time a new commit is loaded. There is no guaranteed order in which the commits come in, but in most of the cases the next commit is a parent of the previous commit.
* A commit object has its own revision id and the revision ids of all its parents
* I have a list of branch heads that should be listed. That is, there isn't a single 'top' of the DAG that should be displayed. There also does not have to be a single graph root.

Output:

* I'll need to linearize these commits in topological order. That is, a commit cannot be listed after its parents have been listed. 
* I also need the 'branch lines' that can be seen in the screenshot above. These probably need to be precomputed as most of them depend on their children.

A few remarks:

* It's necessary to relocate a list of commits. For example, we might have to commits (branch heads) that are unrelated, until a commit shows up which makes one head an ancestor of the other.
* Multiple branch tips must be shown
* It's important that this process is incremental, so that at least a partial view is available while the data is still loading. This means that new data has to be inserted halfway and that the branch lines have to be readjusted.

We have a central repository with two branches, dev and master. We create local branches to work on individual tasks. We merge into dev when they are ready.

If multiple developers need to cooperate on a task more directly, we can create another, possibly temporary, remote branch for them to share patches through. This is working out pretty well for us, but it leaves us with two problems.

One problem is the issue of backups. Sure, most of the code base is backed up. Every machine that has a clone of the repository has most of the code. However, the code that someone writes during the course of a day is not backed up until they merge to dev and push. If the task they are working on is non-trivial, it could be days before they have anything merge and push worthy. How do we make sure this work in progress code is backed up in a central safe place? Just use some backup solution external to Git?

We need some way to show our work on a daily basis that doesn't force us to commit and push code that isn't ready for committing, merging, and pushing.

One solution we considered is to create a remote branch on the central repo for every single local branch we make. This would probably work, but it would be a big cluttered mess, even if we regularly deleted old unused branches. It's also a lot of extra work to manage all that.

Currently, I have large problems because tickets are in proprietary coffins in Bitbucket and Github, apparently their business strategy to lock users. I hope this does not sound radical but I am looking a way to manage my tickets in some repository: if I do a ticket, I want to commit that. I want to keep track of my tickets also because I want to be able to change the provider later easily.



       ----> tickets' version-control (VC)
       |
    ---|---> code's VC
       |
       |---> structural VC (dif projects: submods, forks, large repo-planning etc)

This is my understanding from what I've read:

Unix and Mac clients use LF line endings.  
Windows clients use CRLF line endings.

When core.autocrlf is set to true on the client, the git repository always stores files in LF line ending format and line endings in files on the client are converted back and forth on check out / commit for clients (i.e. Windows) that use non-LF line endings, no matter what format the line endings files are on the client.

The user manual is written using <a href=""http://www.docbook.org"">DocBook</a>.

The repository has different branches for different release branches. For instance, we have a 'major' branch to which features can be committed and out of which the next major release created. We also have a 'minor' branch to which only bugfixes may be committed, and out of which the next minor release is made. The minor branch is merged into the major branch quite often to make sure that all the bugfixes which have been done also end up in the next major release (so that we don't have a regression between e.g. v1.3 and v2).

The issue I'm seeing is that since the software between the major and minor branch is different (major contains new features), the documentation is different as well (the documentation in the major branch might have been rewritten in some places to mention the new features). Every now and then this causes conflicts in the DocBook sources when merging 'minor' into 'major' because single lines differ between the branches. This is actually true for other documentation files (like, `ChangeLog` files) true.

I recently started wondering how to improve this. My ideas included:

 1. Just have one version of the manual for both the major branch and the minor branch. For version-specific features, explicitely say something like ""Starting with v2 of the software, you can also do XYZ"".
 2. Move the documentation files into a dedicated git repository. This will still cause conflicts when merging the 'minor' branch of the repository into 'major', but at least all the software developers who work on the source code don't see (and get annoyed by) the conflicts.
 3. Use dedicated git repositories and embed them as <a href=""http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-submodule.html"">git submodules</a> into the original repository. I'm not quite sure what this would gain me, but I heard it's a bit painful to use submodules like this because I'd end up updating the reference commit to be pulled from the foreign repository all the time.

The issue I'm seeing is that since the software between the major and minor branch is different (major contains new features), the documentation is different as well (the documentation in the major branch might have been rewritten in some places to mention the new features). Every now and then this causes conflicts in the DocBook sources when merging 'minor' into 'major' because single lines differ between the branches. This is actually true for other documentation files (like, `ChangeLog` files) true.

I recently started wondering how to improve this. My ideas included:

 1. Just have one version of the manual for both the major branch and the minor branch. For version-specific features, explicitely say something like ""Starting with v2 of the software, you can also do XYZ"".
 2. Move the documentation files into a dedicated git repository. This will still cause conflicts when merging the 'minor' branch of the repository into 'major', but at least all the software developers who work on the source code don't see (and get annoyed by) the conflicts.
 3. Use dedicated git repositories and embed them as <a href=""http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-submodule.html"">git submodules</a> into the original repository. I'm not quite sure what this would gain me, but I heard it's a bit painful to use submodules like this because I'd end up updating the reference commit to be pulled from the foreign repository all the time.

I'm wondering - how does everybody else handle this situation of keeping source code and documentation together? Note that I'm not talking about API documentation (which can be generated from source code automatically) here but plain, manually written, english text.",3

I've done 3 so far, and I don't think any of them have worked properly or worked where I want them to.

1. On the 19th, I tried to handle a pull request that Yi created.  In GitExtensions, I did a pull within GitExtensions, putting in the remote repository, selecting master as the remote branch, and leaving *Merge remote branch to current branch* as the default.  I clicked Pull and it completed without error.  I then did a push in GitExtensions.  It didn't fill in a commit message, which surprised me, so I just tossed in the url of Yi's commit because I didn't know what else to do.  The result was that it shows up as a pair of commits, one from Yi as an author and one from me as an author.  

2. Later on the 19th, I tried to handle a pull request that Michael created.  Since it seemed pretty clear that I did the first one wrong, I looked for another option.  I ran the first set of commands found [here](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/#merging_a_pull_request), and this does seem to have worked great.  The only problem is that I had to do it via the command line rather than within GitExtensions.

3. Another pull request from Yi.  Since doing it via GitBash rather than GitExtensions seemed to work the last time, I tried it again.  This time however, it wouldn't complete because there were merge conflicts.  Ok, so I go to GitExtensions and do a merge because I know that will let me solve the conflicts.  So, I open up the Merge branches dialog and select `Merge with` and select Yi's master branch leaving `Keep a single branch line if possible (fast forward)`.  I resolve the conflicts and do a push.  It automatically put in the commit message for me.  This shows up as 4 entries, 3 from Yi as the author, and 1 from me as the author.  Doesn't seem right.

So my question is, how am I supposed to do this properly?  I've got another pull request and I want to make sure I am handling it correctly.  The fork queue says it won't apply cleanly, so I foresee that I'll need to do a merge.  I want to make sure that I am merging properly and that the branches and the commits are being attributed to the people that did the work.

We currently have one large project that contains our schema/entities, our front-end web processes, and 2 versions of our REST API. I'd love to separate all of this into separate repositories if possible. Here's the kind of directory structure we have at the moment:

    lib/Project/Entity/*.pm
    lib/Projcet/Data/*.pm
    lib/Project/Server/Controller/*.pm
    lib/Project/Server/Controller/WS/1/*.pm
    lib/Project/Server/Controller/WS/2/*.pm
    lib/Project/Server/Form/*.pm

And so on. I'd like to be able to take the `Entity` and `Data` directories and move them to a new repository, and preferably move them as well:

    lib/Project/Schema/Entity/*.pm
    lib/Project/Schema/Data/*.pm

With the remaining files I'd like to split them apart into 2 more repositories, one for our front end server, and one for the REST API. I figure even though the REST API has 2 different versions we can split this into 2 separate branches (v1 and v2 branches).

I feel like filter-branch is pretty much exactly what I want (maybe with additional commits on top to move files), but I can't quite see exactly how to make this happen. Does anyone have any advice?
