I'm creating a game where a lot of images are being used in Actionscript / Flex 3 (Flash). Now that I've reached the designer stage, I have to work out a structural way of using embedded images (which have to be manipulated with rotation, color, etc.).

Unfortunately, after investigating a bit, it looks like you have to manually embed images before you can use them. I currently have it setup like this:

Resource.as class file:

The one loading more videos is using nearly 1GB of ram as well.

I don't know how to find what the main problem is.  I've been having lots of help, so the code isn't optimized or refactored at all.  It's repeatedly calling a php file every three seconds (flashpull.php) to check for a variable in a database on my server.  When I inspected the local storage, it was infinitely putting more and more ""flashpull.php"" files on the server, but that file is only 2KB and i dont think that would cause the swf to be as intensive as it is.  Is there a way I can keep checking that file, but overwrite the local storage copy, or is that even a big deal?

I'm using greensock to load all the videos, I have maxConnections set at 6, don't know if that affects it.

I'm really hoping there's a glaring problem or memory leak, instead of the overall file just being so bloated that it's causing such bad performance.

Oh, and to be honest, the matrix class is mystifying.

		public var myTween:Tween;
		
		public function Scaling()
		{
			this.stage.scaleMode = StageScaleMode.NO_SCALE;
			this.stage.align = StageAlign.TOP_LEFT;
			
			mySprite.graphics.beginFill(0xF7F3DC);
			mySprite.graphics.lineStyle(5, 0xD35F72);
			mySprite.graphics.drawRoundRect(0, 0, 300, 100, 10, 10);
			mySprite.graphics.endFill();
			
			mySprite.x = 800 / 2;
			mySprite.y = 600 / 2;
			mySprite.width = 300;
			mySprite.height = 100;
			
			addChild(mySprite);
			
			setTimeout(DoScale, 500);

			var o:Object = new Object();
			o[""scale""] = 0;
			myTween = new Tween(o, ""scale"", Elastic.easeIn, 1, 1.5, 0.75, true);
			myTween.addEventListener(TweenEvent.MOTION_CHANGE, function(evt:TweenEvent):void {

I've been working with some custom renders for an editable datagrid and I am trying to figure out how to have the cell renderer dynamically reference it's column Header.

In my code my setData() and TextChangeEvent() need to reference the data of the column. In this case I use the header names _1 through _12 so that I can easily change the headertext for different languages.

How do I reference the _data._5 in a dynamic fashion so I only have 1 renderer and not 30 of them.

Looking for how I would do: 

    _data.getCurrentColumn();
    or
    _data._header;

in a practical fashion to streamline things as I am currently attempting to manage 30+ of these renderers depending on the grid and data type.

Thank you for any feedback,

I was trying to get look into quadtrees, but already ran into trouble getting collision detection without any optimization working properly. Did a search and found a pretty neat example:
http://wonderfl.net/c/kyLx
(onenterframeC part mostly)

Trying to imitate this, it won't work the same.
Only some collisions are detected between particular objects. When the objects are not moving it seems to work alot better for some reason.

I really can't figure out whats the problem, the code is essentially the same as the sample. I did not blindy copy pasted it, I understands whats happening except for this part: 

    if (j <= i)
                            continue;

J would never become bigger that I right? The line also completely removes any working collisions for me.

Any help would greatly be appreciated, want to get further on this !",actionscript-3,garbage-collection,,,,,open,0,1779,10,"Collision detection for loop problem, only one array item tested? *[I apologise if this isn't really an in depth question, but I wanted to solve this once and for all]*

I was trying to get look into quadtrees, but already ran into trouble getting collision detection without any optimization working properly. Did a search and found a pretty neat example:
http://wonderfl.net/c/kyLx
(onenterframeC part mostly)

Trying to imitate this, it won't work the same.
Only some collisions are detected between particular objects. When the objects are not moving it seems to work alot better for some reason.

I really can't figure out whats the problem, the code is essentially the same as the sample. I did not blindy copy pasted it, I understands whats happening except for this part: 

    if (j <= i)
                            continue;

J would never become bigger that I right? The line also completely removes any working collisions for me.

I want something like the following

    var example:Example = new Example();
    
    // the following won't work, because example.something is a string
    var asdf:Function = example.something; 
    asdf(""a value""); // this trace: ""something""

1) I am not embedding any fonts in the application. I am not even assigning the Arial font to any of the components.

The voice streaming with NetStreams works perfectly fine almost no delay here, but we also want to transfer the activity level of the microphone of each member of the NetGroup.

So we tried transferring the data using NetGroup.post(data). That worked well, but had a delay of ~500ms even when testing with multiple clients on the same machine!

Obviously, half a second in microphone activity is just waaay to much delay to display it in any way.

Now we are trying to use direct routing with NetGroup.sendToAllNeighbors(, but it simply does nothing. I have read all the documentation on it and normally a NetGroup status event with ""NetGroup.SendTo.Notify"" should be triggered on the receiving clients. Instead, nothing happens.

Here is the code, which is called each frame:

    var tsObject :TimestampedObject = new TimestampedObject();
	tsObject.timestamp = (new Date()).getTime();
	tsObject.sender = _netConnection.nearID;
	tsObject.object = _mic.activityLevel;
				
	_netGroup.sendToAllNeighbors(tsObject);

The voice streaming with NetStreams works perfectly fine almost no delay here, but we also want to transfer the activity level of the microphone of each member of the NetGroup.

So we tried transferring the data using NetGroup.post(data). That worked well, but had a delay of ~500ms even when testing with multiple clients on the same machine!

Obviously, half a second in microphone activity is just waaay to much delay to display it in any way.

Now we are trying to use direct routing with NetGroup.sendToAllNeighbors(, but it simply does nothing. I have read all the documentation on it and normally a NetGroup status event with ""NetGroup.SendTo.Notify"" should be triggered on the receiving clients. Instead, nothing happens.

Here is the code, which is called each frame:

    var tsObject :TimestampedObject = new TimestampedObject();
	tsObject.timestamp = (new Date()).getTime();
	tsObject.sender = _netConnection.nearID;
	tsObject.object = _mic.activityLevel;
				
	_netGroup.sendToAllNeighbors(tsObject);

So we have  Ace extends Card which extends MovieClip.  Ace therefore extends MovieClip, but does not DIRECTLY extend MovieClip.

When I drop an instance of Ace on the stage and compile the clip, all that shows up is the big letter A.  However, I expected the background image from Card to be included, since Ace extends Card, and the Card symbol contains the background.

It seems like Flash ignores symbol content unless it belongs to the top-level class being instantiated.  I think it's LAME that one symbol can't extend another.  The IDE could easily draw Card as a non-editable background while I'm editing Ace which extends it, and it should instantiate Card's content and then Ace's content when an Ace is instantiated.

When I run my air application (compiled via flexmojos), it seems ""empty""--there is no window at all.  It works perfectly when compiled from Flash Builder.

Background
---

I am compiling an Adobe Air Application using Maven's flexmojos plugin on Mac OS X: Lion.  It successfully produces a SWF file and an AIR file.

 - When I double-click the SWF file, it opens just fine<br>
   (and crashes with an error you'd expect--since it's not running in the AIR environment)

 - **When I double-click the AIR file, no window opens!**<br>
   (I see my application name in the Mac menu bar but no application window and no errors)

When I look under `/Applications/MyApplication.app/Contents/Resources`<br>
I see the following files:

    META-INF		    MyAppMainAir.swf
    MyAppMainAir.css	mimetype

The swf file has the proper size and opens, as expected.

When I run my air application (compiled via flexmojos), it seems ""empty""--there is no window at all.  It works perfectly when compiled from Flash Builder.

Background
---

I am compiling an Adobe Air Application using Maven's flexmojos plugin on Mac OS X: Lion.  It successfully produces a SWF file and an AIR file.

 - When I double-click the SWF file, it opens just fine<br>
   (and crashes with an error you'd expect--since it's not running in the AIR environment)

 - **When I double-click the AIR file, no window opens!**<br>
   (I see my application name in the Mac menu bar but no application window and no errors)

When I look under `/Applications/MyApplication.app/Contents/Resources`<br>
I see the following files:

    META-INF		    MyAppMainAir.swf
    MyAppMainAir.css	mimetype

The swf file has the proper size and opens, as expected.

Why is my SWF file being created properly but my AIR application won't open a window?  When I build/run the application from Flash Builder, it works perfectly.

No matter what loading technique I try to use, I'm running into placement and orientation problems in the child swf which break the child.

In one example case, the child will load a secondary displayobject (presumably a movieclip), but attempts to attach it to the stage.  If I allow it access to the stage via the SecurityDomain during loading, it orients it at 0,0 of the parent swf instead of 0,0 of the child swf (which is already position/centered appropriately).

In another, the child positioning during load is appropriate, but placement inside the child which seem to reference the stage for their X,Y positions is offset by the amount the child swf has been centered (i.e. if the loader of the child swf is centered such that it's X is at 200, and an object inside the child swf is supposed to be at 100,50, it is actually at 300,50).

The common thread seems to be that the child swfs, whether or not allowed to access the stage, are using stage or player properties of the parent instead of those of their own within the loader.

How can I isolate the child swf such that it only uses it's own sub-environment for positioning and orientation and not the parent's?

I have tried the built-in Loader and UILoader, Greensock's SWFLoader, Flex's SWFLoader and even loading it via text in a TextField.

Ideally, I'd still like to be able to communicate with the child, but at this point ensuring the child runs successfully is more important.

		public function SeatSettingsVO(obj:Object = null)
		{
			if (obj)
				parseSettings(obj);
		}

The `parseSettings` method uses a **try/catch** block in order to get only the existing properties in the object passed to the constructor (or at least, that would be the intention):


		private function parseSettings(obj:Object):void
		{
			try

				this.chipStackOffset = obj.chipStackOffset;
				this.dealerChipOffset = obj.dealerChipOffset;

Now consider this scenario: a new Value Object needs to be created, but with only one of the three properties defined:

    new SeatSettingsVO({globalPosition:new Point(300, 277)})

The problem is that if `obj` does not contain a particular property (e.g. `chipStackOffset`), instead of maintaining the initial property value (Point(0,0)), the method overwrites it to `null`.

My guess is that accessing non-existent properties on an Object class instance, does not trigger an error, but rather, `null` is returned, which in turn causes the default value to be overwritten. Can anyone explain this behavior, and possibly suggest a solution ?

		public var chipStackOffset:Point = new Point(0, 0);

		public function SeatSettingsVO(obj:Object = null)
		{
			if (obj)
				parseSettings(obj);
		}
	}

The `parseSettings` method uses a **try/catch** block in order to get only the existing properties in the object passed to the constructor (or at least, that would be the intention):


		private function parseSettings(obj:Object):void
		{
			try
			{
				this.globalPosition = obj.globalPosition;
				this.chipStackOffset = obj.chipStackOffset;
				this.dealerChipOffset = obj.dealerChipOffset;
			}
			catch (error:Error)
			{
			}
		}

Now consider this scenario: a new Value Object needs to be created, but with only one of the three properties defined:

    new SeatSettingsVO({globalPosition:new Point(300, 277)})

The problem is that if `obj` does not contain a particular property (e.g. `chipStackOffset`), instead of maintaining the initial property value (Point(0,0)), the method overwrites it to `null`.

My guess is that accessing non-existent properties on an Object class instance, does not trigger an error, but rather, `null` is returned, which in turn causes the default value to be overwritten. Can anyone explain this behavior, and possibly suggest a solution ?

Thank you very much.",3

So, ""my"" idea is, to use:

- Robotlegs (main framework to wire up the entire app)
- AS3Signals (to handle events)
- Starling (to manage the render)

I was reading a lot about this, and this seems to be a good approach.

The app, its actually a game, but not a full realtime game, its more like an hybrid of a turn based game and an realtime game, basically, there are 2 phases, one is the ""planning time"", where the users make their choices, the game is freezed, and the other is the ""action time"" where the action occurs, based on what the players decided to do in the planning time.

My doubt is, I've read that Robotlegs is not suited for games, but also read different opinions about it.

Let me know what you think.

I can return this binary data in two ways, return a String on the C# side, or a byte[]. Both give the same result (except that string has “” around it). When I test the operation in Flash Builder, I also get the exact same String. 

However, when I try to encode this string into Binary64Data, which is what it officially is in the xml description, I get an odd result. Both Strings should be the same, but the later half of the encoded String is different. Eventuelly I want to get a ByteArray out of it, which I can use to create my image. This works perfectly with the String version, but the other version returns a half-ruined (but recognizable) picture. 

What could my problem be? Here is my code, when using a string:

    // This works:
    var data:String = getBinaryString(); // Returns the result from webservice call token.lastResult

    // Remove the two quotes
    data = data.substr(1);
    data = data.substr(0, data.length-1); 
			
    // Decode the base64 string
    var dec : Base64Decoder  = new Base64Decoder();
    dec.decode(data); 
    imgByteArray = dec.toByteArray();

    // Load the image:
    loader = new Loader();
    loader.loadBytes(bytes);
    loader.contentLoaderInfo.addEventListener(Event.COMPLETE,loaderCompleteHandler);

    // in the event handler:
    var bmp:Bitmap = Bitmap(loader.content);
    // Some misc stuff, but eventually an image shows, the correct image


But when I try the webservice method that should return a ByteArray:

    var data = getBinaryData(); // returns the result from webservice again
			
    var enc : Base64Encoder   = new Base64Encoder ();
    enc.insertNewLines = false;
    enc.encode(data);
			
    var dataString:String = enc.flush(); // also tried toString(), same result
				
    // This dataString should be eactly the same as the above datastring, 
    // but for some reason, the second half of the string is entirely different, 
    // while the first half is exactly the same

Is there something I am doing wrong? Preferably I would want to skip the entire encoding/decoding, and just use the ByteArray the webservice call is supposed to return in the first place, but when I try to cast it as such:

    var data:ByteArray = getBinaryData() as ByteArray;

Data becomes null. This same data can be transformed with the above sequence, so the data is not empty.

How can I solve my problem? Again, please note that in Flash Builder, using the test operation facilities, both the String as the ByteArray webservice calls return the same value, it is only in the Actionscript 3 that my values diverge.
