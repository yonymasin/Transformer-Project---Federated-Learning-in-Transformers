DITA is a maturing standard for modular technical writing. It seems to be gaining some popularly in the enterprise, but it's a bit hard to tell.

The DITA-OT's PDF rendering is well known for being underwhelming, and this seems to be a feature of the limited XSL-FO transforms. I think this is a big factor in DITA's (so far) low adoption.

I've used LaTeX via Org-mode, texinfo, LyX, etc., and these all produce lovely PDFs with the classy TeX look.

I have a `tabular` array in LaTeX, that contains quite a lot of rows and columns, which both are brain regions and in the each intersecting cell there is some data about their connections.

The content of this `tabular` array is defined separately in another .tex file that is loaded using `\input` command. In this another .tex file the content of each cell of the `tabular` array is defined separately using hundreds of `\newcommand` commands. In `tabular` array there is no other content except these `\newcommand` commands. `tabular` array is inside `\begin{spreadtab}` to permit some basic calculations of cells values (although this is not a requirement). Everything works fine so far.

So, the `\newcommand` definitions look like this:

    \newcommand{\origREGIONONEdestREGIONTWO}{ - } % this is the default case.
    \newcommand{\origREGIONONEdestREGIONTWO}{ NA } % NA for cells on the diagonal.

    \newcommand{\origREGIONTWOdestREGIONONE}{ \ref{Spielberg1981} }

        \end{enumerate}
    \end{table}

Now what I want is to be able to generate a similar `tabular` definition dynamically according to a list or an array of strings (or using any possible datatype):

in MATLAB syntax it would be: `ListOfBrainRegions = { 'BRAINREGIONABC', 'BRAINREGIONDEF', 'BRAINREGIONXYZ' }`

In Python syntax: `ListOfBrainRegions = [ 'BRAINREGIONABC', 'BRAINREGIONDEF', 'BRAINREGIONXYZ' ]`

The list or array would be translated into a code like this inside `spreadtab` (or without `spreadtab` if it causes some problems):

                \hline
                to REGIONABC :={} & \origREGIONABCdestREGIONABC :={} & \origREGIONDEFdestREGIONABC :={} &\origREGIONXYZdestREGIONABC :={} \\
                to REGIONDEF :={} & \origREGIONABCdestREGIONDEF :={} & \origREGIONDEFdestREGIONDEF :={} &\origREGIONXYZdestREGIONDEF :={} \\
                to REGIONXYZ :={} & \origREGIONABCdestREGIONXYZ :={} & \origREGIONDEFdestREGIONXYZ :={} &\origREGIONXYZdestREGIONXYZ :={} \\
                \hline

So, how should I define `ListOfBrainRegions` in LaTeX? And then how can I generate LaTeX code during compiling of a .tex file? If I was to program this in some other programming language, for example in MATLAB, Common Lisp or awk the task (generating program code) would not be difficult at all. It seems that LaTeX does not have built-in arrays, `if` ... `elseif` ... `else` commands nor `for` or `while` loops, although some packages provide some added functionality. So, how this could be implemented? Or, which LaTeX commands, packages and/or extra tools should I use for this task?

Thank you for any help :)",latex,,,,,04/18/2012 21:49:47,off topic,1,762,6,"generating LaTeX tabular code during compilation I use LaTeX for scientific reporting in brain imaging (fMRI). I have a `tabular` array in LaTeX, that contains quite a lot of rows and columns, which both are brain regions and in the each intersecting cell there is some data about their connections.

The content of this `tabular` array is defined separately in another .tex file that is loaded using `\input` command. In this another .tex file the content of each cell of the `tabular` array is defined separately using hundreds of `\newcommand` commands. In `tabular` array there is no other content except these `\newcommand` commands. `tabular` array is inside `\begin{spreadtab}` to permit some basic calculations of cells values (although this is not a requirement). Everything works fine so far.

So, the `\newcommand` definitions look like this:

    \newcommand{\origREGIONONEdestREGIONTWO}{ - } % this is the default case.
    \newcommand{\origREGIONONEdestREGIONTWO}{ NA } % NA for cells on the diagonal.

This assumes that `basicstyle` sets the default style of all text. The listings documentation says this:

> basicstyle is selected at the beginning of each listing. You could use \footnotesize,
\small, \itshape, \ttfamily, or something like that. The last token of <basic style> must not read any following characters.

The output of this still shows ""default"" text as black. It is possible to set *more* style directives that cover most tokens in a given programming language, but even doing this some tokens (such as brackets and other punctuation) will be missed. What did I do wrong?
