 - The header and footer should be outside the listing itself, i.e. they are not part of the listing content.
 - The amount of space between the header and the listing should be the same as the amount of space between the footer and the listing.
 - The amount of space between the listing and the header/footer should not be rubber, i.e. TeX should not be able adjust the header/footer closer to or farther from the listing.
 - The header and footer may not be the same for every listing.
 - Page breaks should not be possible between the header/footer and the listing.
 - Page breaks should be possible within the listing itself.

I was requested to submit my article with (Author, Year) instead of subscript Roman-numeral.

Unfortunately LibreOffice on Windows 8 was crashing regularly, so I moved to an Ubuntu VM. An even greater misfortune awaited when the references in the document weren't recognised by Zotero (same account), so I ended up having two different bibliographic styles in my document.

When I finished writing, I received an error preventing me from inserting the bibliography, since there was already a bibliography for the other style.

(I was able to generate one though after deleting all the alternate references) - Then I cut that bibliography out, Ctrl+Z many times, then put it after the alternate bibliography.

**Now I have two bibliographies, and two referencing styles in my document.**

How do I repair this?

I was requested to submit my article with (Author, Year) instead of subscript Roman-numeral.

Unfortunately LibreOffice on Windows 8 was crashing regularly, so I moved to an Ubuntu VM. An even greater misfortune awaited when the references in the document weren't recognised by Zotero (same account), so I ended up having two different bibliographic styles in my document.

When I finished writing, I received an error preventing me from inserting the bibliography, since there was already a bibliography for the other style.

(I was able to generate one though after deleting all the alternate references) - Then I cut that bibliography out, Ctrl+Z many times, then put it after the alternate bibliography.
