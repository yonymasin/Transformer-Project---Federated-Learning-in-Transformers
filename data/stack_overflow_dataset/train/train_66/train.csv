This could be just fine if the amount of images and their widths wasn't dynamic. Unfortunately this isn't the case here.

In brief, I'm formalizing display ""states"" or ""modes"" using CSS classes. I've tried searching for ""css modes"", ""css states"", ""stateful css"", etc. but if it exists then it doesn't use any of those names.

Here's a simple example of what I'm doing. The example is a responsive text input, the sort that would talk to the server and tell you dynamically whether the username you've chosen is already taken.

Markup:

    <div id=""username-container"" class=""username-mode-ready"">
        <!-- input -->
        <label for=""username"" class=""username-label"">Username:</label>
        <input type=""text"" id=""username"" class=""username-input"" />
        
        <!-- icons -->
        <img src=""error.png"" class=""icon error""/>
        <img src=""ok.png"" class=""icon accepted""/>
        <img src=""loading.gif"" class=""icon loading""/>
        
        <!-- messages -->
        <p class=""message error"">
            That username is not available.
        </p>
        <p class=""message accepted"">
            That username is available!
        </p>
        <p class=""message loading"">
            Loading ...
        </p>
    </div>

CSS:

    /* Default = hidden */
    #username-container .error,
    #username-container .accepted,
    #username-container .loading {
        display : none;
    }
    
    /* Show when appropriate */
    #username-container.username-mode-error    .error,
    #username-container.username-mode-accepted .accepted,
    #username-container.username-mode-loading  .loading {
        display : block;
    }

Now we would add our Javascript. When we go to the server we'll do:

    $('username-container').className = 'username-mode-loading';

And when we return, we'll do one of the following based on the server response:

    $('username-container').className = 'username-mode-accepted'; // Username available
    $('username-container').className = 'username-mode-error';    // Username taken

This way, we can just change the className of the container to see different display modes without the need for manipulating element.style.display on a million different elements. We can also do more than show/hide:

CSS:

    /* Set label color to green or red depending on availability */
    #username-container.username-mode-accepted .username-label {
        color : green;
    }
    #username-container.username-mode-error .username-label {
        color : red;
    }

Or apply styles across multiple modes:

Markup:

    <img alt=""Whew! I searched as hard as I could!"" src=""done-searching.png"" class=""icon done-searching""/>

CSS:

    /* New icon should display in accepted and error modes */
    #username-container .done-searching {
        display : none;
    }
    #username-container.username-mode-accepted .done-searching,
    #username-container.username-mode-error    .done-searching {
        display : block;

I want to show a 'notification bar' indicating whether an AJAX request was successful or not. The bar is supposed to slide in from under the header (bar of ~30px) and slide out after 5s. BUT if the header is not visible (user scrolled down) the bar should be 'attached' on the very top of the screen - if user scrolls up again, the bar should scroll too & end up beneath header again.

**What I Have**

I have the bar working via 'animate' (jQuery) and

**What I Want**

The thing is, I can either make the bar come out under the header and stay there (problem: not visible when scrolled) or make the bar come out at the very top of the screen (problem: hides header when shown).

It's a rare purchase for me because I normally only go with open-source or software that has 'per user' licensing.   The license and DRM on this thing are horrid.   It does a hardware check (including a check for the existance of a battery) and only lets you install on one laptop and one desktop.   Of course, I've got a work desktop and laptop as well as a two home desktops and two home laptops.   I'd love to use the thing at home but there's no way I'm going to pay for another seperate license when I'm just one guy with mutliple machines no one else uses but me.

Aside from my loathing of the license type and DRM, the $79 price seems reasonable (no problem there).

I've tried searching for hours and can't find another css editor that visually works on the rendered pages.   I'm using Rails and the whole Stylizer concept of being a multi-engine web browser that lets you target elements on the rendered page is a life saver.  Nothing else I've seen would really add any benifit above Rubymines CSS editing (which btw - thank you for the per-user license Jetbrains). 

If someone else had something similiar, I'd gladly pay twice the price for a per-user license.  Funny - I'd be happy paying $150 for a per user license, but the thought of paying for two $79 license because (my gosh) I use two different laptops annoys the crap out of me.

---

 don't we have `box-sizing: margin-box;`? Usually when we put `box-sizing: border-box;` in our style sheets we really mean the former.

<br>

For example:
------------


Let's say I have a 2 column page layout. Both columns have a width of 50%, but they look kind of ugly because there's no gutter (gap in the middle); Below is the CSS:

	.col2 {
		width: 50%;
		float: left;
	}



<br>To apply a gutter you might think we could just set a right margin on the first of the 2 columns; something like this:

	.col2:first-child {
		margin-right: 24px;
	}

But this would make the second column wrap onto a new line, because the following is true:

	50% + 50% + 24px > 100%

<br>

What can we do?
---------------
`box-sizing: margin-box;` would solve this issue by including margin in the calculated width of the element.


If you ask me, `box-sizing: margin-box;` would be *very* usefull if not more useful than `box-sizing: border-box;`. So why don't / can't we have `box-sizing: margin-box;`?

Second, the ListSetContainer div is only one pixel high - there is no background shown! (I'm using a Red background just to be sure I don't miss it).  The whole enclosing div is just squashed down and the inner divs are floating out on their own. Setting the height manually doesn't work because the inner div with the list is variable height (and it looks odd, to boot).  If I remove the float:left; from the inner divs, they expand to be the full width of the screen and thus I cannot get three in a row.  So...I'm at a loss.

I can handle this event manually, question is - what plugin or existing css/js combination should I use to achieve this?

I am pretty sure that this type of controls have a name, but can't think out what is this. I have tried to search for custom style radio buttons, as functionality is the same, but failed. Also I have tried some other names such as switch buttons, but it's not what I want. It's also very similar to tabs, but tabs usually styled as something that require underline div attached. So I am looking for ""radio button meet tabs"" css/js solution.

Can you help me to name this control, if you know it's name, or find plugin/existing code that can help me to achieve my goal?

The question is not how to create this type of functionality myself, I can do it, but it's rather strange that there are no existing solutions and I want to help people in same situation, also may be existing solutions design can be better than I can invent myself, because I am not a designer.",2

Mostly easy, good, and painless...except for 1 issue related to display of features that have the following elements: header image, background image, and another image layered over the background. In all cases of this, there's a gap between the header image and background - maybe 4-5 pixels. I've attached an image showing the issue. Happens across browsers I can test (Firefox, IE, Chrome).

This doesn't seem to happen if I add text first (before the image)....and it doesn't happen in the original website - only when I migrate it to Squarespace. I can only make the extra spaces go away if I adjust the line height to something ridiculous which scrunches the text.  I've checked to see if some other Squarespace CSS (like overall ""body"" settings or something) might be effecting this - nothing I can see. 

Would love any advice. Thanks!

Mostly easy, good, and painless...except for 1 issue related to display of features that have the following elements: header image, background image, and another image layered over the background. In all cases of this, there's a gap between the header image and background - maybe 4-5 pixels. I've attached an image showing the issue. Happens across browsers I can test (Firefox, IE, Chrome).

This doesn't seem to happen if I add text first (before the image)....and it doesn't happen in the original website - only when I migrate it to Squarespace. I can only make the extra spaces go away if I adjust the line height to something ridiculous which scrunches the text.  I've checked to see if some other Squarespace CSS (like overall ""body"" settings or something) might be effecting this - nothing I can see. 

Would love any advice. Thanks! 

Here's the CSS (no changes in it from original site to new platform):

One for the submit of the page that posts to an action and another to cancel that posts to a different action.  For whatever reason IE has a problem with placing these two buttons side by side.

       { %>

Here is the css for those classes:

    .button_row { float:left; width: 100%; }
    .button_cell_left {float:left; width: 20%; }
    .button_cell_right {float:left; width: 20%;  }

The 20% width is plenty room wise for those buttons.  Like i said in ie they won't stay on the same line but in firefox they will.  My question is why given my code?

Thanks in advance,

Their CSS style:

I don't ask about hacks. I don't ask about combination like `something *` or `something * something_else`. They may be sometimes handy. I ask only about lone `*`.

I know this selector set styles on every element on a page. However, why should I need this? The `html` or/and `body` are enough to put few default values. I think the reset of every padding and margin to 0 is an overkill. Only few elements may need this.

 - Jquery color animate and some javascript references.

I am trying to overlay a legend over a map. the map is generated with openlayers and lives in a div called map. the legend is an html table but could be a picture as well and lives in another div called legend. 

hence the html

    <body>
    <div id=""map""></div>
    <div id=""legend""></div>
    </body>

and the css

    * {

        padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px;

in IE8 the legend is shown in its place, the red page background is behind but the map div has disappeared. Note that IE still loads the map tiles etc but seems to be putting them either behind the background or somewhere not on the screen...

    <table>
	<tr align=""center"">
	<td>
	<div class=""projectimglink"">

		<img class=""projectimg-color"" src=""image01-color.jpg"" />
		</a>
	</div>
	</td>
	<td>
		<a href=""#"">
		<img class=""projectimg"" src=""image02-bw.jpg"" />
		</a>
	</td>
	</tr>
	<tr align=""center"">

		<img class=""projectimg"" src=""image04-bw.jpg"" />
		</a>
	</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
        </div>

    #projects table {
    	
    	width:510px;

I'm running into a problem wherein large scroll areas cause the elements that are offscreen to appear after a delay when I scroll down to them.

What I mean by that is, if I have a row of images (or even a div with a gradient) that is offscreen, when I scroll down (or up) to it, the **expected behavior** is for the element to appear on screen as I am scrolling to it.

However, what I'm seeing is that the element **does not appear** until I lift my finger off the screen and the scroller finishes all its animations.

This is causing a super noticeable problem for me, making the whole thing look choppy, although it is not. I'm guessing the iPad Safari is trying to do something to save memory. Is there any way in which I can prevent this choppy-ness from happening. Additionally, I would also appreciate if anyone can shed light on what the iPad Safari is actually trying to do.

Thanks.",css,google-chrome,,,,03/11/2012 14:56:30,too localized,1,3442,11,"I think something is wrong with my css in chrome browser My page is nicely viewable in mozilla and ie, but in chrome text is pushed down. Just the text, not background. 

This is my page:  <http://www.petricec.pondi.hr/index.html>

I tried to find similar problem here. but couldn't. Also tried many things to change in my CSS but couldn't find out where is the problem.
English is not my first language, so sorry for any misspells(I hate them too). Thanks for any help.

The original stylesheet contains a rule `#side ul.author li.subj`. I added `.user #side ul.author li.subj`. Surprisingly, following code wasn't rendered as expected, which I expected where the second rule should be used:

    <div class=""user"">

As far as I know, the specificity of each rule should be:

    #side ul.author li.subj => 0122
    .user #side ul.author li.subj => 0132

Thus the latter should have higher specificity, yet the first rule is used in this case.

http://code.google.com/intl/de-DE/speed/page-speed/docs/rendering.html#UseEfficientCSSSelectors

Specifically, descendant selectors are great for selecting a whole block (e.g. DIV) using an ID or CLASS attribute and then keeping all of its child elements free of CLASS/ID attributes. But if the order of traversal for applying the rules is as described by Google, they should not be used:

>Descendant selectors are inefficient because, for each element that matches the key, the browser must also traverse up the DOM tree, evaluating every ancestor element until it finds a match or reaches the root element. The less specific the key, the greater the number of nodes that need to be evaluated.

I very much doubt that browsers use such an inefficient order of traversal, surely they would only process subtrees of elements that match the top selector component, i.e. in <code>#foo span {...} </span></code> only elements below #foo should be checked and not every single span. Can anyone who has looked at recent browser code confirm/deny this?

The second questionable suggestion is about overly qualified selectors:

>ID selectors are unique by definition. Including tag or class qualifiers just adds redundant information that needs to be evaluated needlessly.

If ID selectors are unique by definition, why would browsers need to check the redundant information? I know that they do because for example,

> div#foo { color: black; }
>  #foo { color: white; }

will result in black text in a <code>&lt;div id=foo></code>, but a) it should not be done(? W3C reference needed) and b) I don't see why it would be noticeably slower when it results in a simple O(1) check of the element's tag name. 

Can anyone on good terms with modern browsers' source code shed some light on these claims? Since most modern sites use descendant selectors (including SO) and they have clear advantages, I'd very much like to use them...

    <html>
    <head><title>Three Column</title></head>
    <body>
    <p>Test</p>
    <table style=""width: 100%; border: 1px solid black; min-height: 300px;"">

    <tr>
    	<td style=""border: 1px solid green; width: 150px;"" rowspan=""2"">Left</td>
    	<td style=""border: 1px solid yellow;"">Content</td>
    	<td style=""border: 1px solid blue; width: 200px;"" rowspan=""2"">Right</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    	<td style=""border: 1px solid fuchsia;"">Additional stuff</td>
    </tr>
    <tr><td style=""border: 1px solid green;"" colspan=""3"">Footer</td></tr>
    </body>
    <html>

 - Left is fixed width
 - Right is fixed width
 - Content is liquid
 - Additional stuff sits beneath content

Now here is the important part: ""Left"" **may not exist**. Again this is easy with the table. Delete the column and ""Content"" expands. Beautiful.
I have looked through many examples (and ""holy grails"") of liquid and table less three-column CSS based layouts, but I have not found one which is not using some kind of margin-left for the middle column (""Content""). Any margin-left will suck once ""Left"" is gone as ""Content"" will just stay at it's place.

I'm just about to switch to old school table based layout for this problem, so I'm hoping someone has some idea - I don't care about excess markup, wrappers and the like, I would just like to know how to solve this with plain CSS. Btw: look at how easy equal height columns are...

PS: No CSS3 please",css,columns,,,,,open,0,292,8,"CSS three column layout, liquid center, no left-margin! I am all in favor of CSS based layouts, but this one I just can't figure out. With a table it is oh-so-easy:

    <html>
    <head><title>Three Column</title></head>
    <body>
    <p>Test</p>
    <table style=""width: 100%; border: 1px solid black; min-height: 300px;"">
    <tr>
    <td style=""border: 1px solid green;"" colspan=""3"">Header</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    	<td style=""border: 1px solid green; width: 150px;"" rowspan=""2"">Left</td>
    	<td style=""border: 1px solid yellow;"">Content</td>
    	<td style=""border: 1px solid blue; width: 200px;"" rowspan=""2"">Right</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    	<td style=""border: 1px solid fuchsia;"">Additional stuff</td>
    </tr>
    <tr><td style=""border: 1px solid green;"" colspan=""3"">Footer</td></tr>
    </body>
    <html>

 - Left is fixed width
 - Right is fixed width
 - Content is liquid
 - Additional stuff sits beneath content

Now here is the important part: ""Left"" **may not exist**. Again this is easy with the table. Delete the column and ""Content"" expands. Beautiful.
I have looked through many examples (and ""holy grails"") of liquid and table less three-column CSS based layouts, but I have not found one which is not using some kind of margin-left for the middle column (""Content""). Any margin-left will suck once ""Left"" is gone as ""Content"" will just stay at it's place.

Let's say you're putting a striped background on a page.  From an efficiency standpoint, is it better to tile an image 100px wide (showing ten stripes), or an image 20px wide (showing two stripes)?  Of course... a large image takes more time to load, but I feel like I've encountered trouble when tiling very small images.  Is there an optimal point?

I'm starting to think this depends on the browser (or maybe the operating system?), especially given part two of this question:

To achieve translucency, is it more efficient to tile a translucent .png file, or work with CSS opacity attributes (again, the question of large vs. small time comes up)?  From my experience, older versions of IE seem to behave better with a tiled, translucent .png than they do with CSS opacity attributes (though I've never done any scientific testing).

Rounded corners are another good example... in some browsers, the use of images instead of CSS attributes or JavaScript implementations seems to make the page much faster, with much smoother scrolling.

This is really a question broader than CSS, but it's just something I've been thinking about lately.

-Peter",css,browser,cross-browser,performance,webpage-rendering,06/07/2011 07:10:24,off topic,1,214,3,"CSS Efficiency Questions For the sake of this question, let ""efficiency"" mean, more-or-less, page rendering speed.  Albeit, we should also take into account performance issues, like smooth scrolling.

Let's say you're putting a striped background on a page.  From an efficiency standpoint, is it better to tile an image 100px wide (showing ten stripes), or an image 20px wide (showing two stripes)?  Of course... a large image takes more time to load, but I feel like I've encountered trouble when tiling very small images.  Is there an optimal point?

I'm starting to think this depends on the browser (or maybe the operating system?), especially given part two of this question:

To achieve translucency, is it more efficient to tile a translucent .png file, or work with CSS opacity attributes (again, the question of large vs. small time comes up)?  From my experience, older versions of IE seem to behave better with a tiled, translucent .png than they do with CSS opacity attributes (though I've never done any scientific testing).

There are some css properties that can only(as far as I know) be modified as a set of values, like _text-shadow_ (`text-shadow:<xOffset> <yOffset> <radius> <color>;`).

 1. Styling each selector, with all the applicable rules in that selector.
 2. Combining selectors for each rule.

Comparison of Models
=
These two files are essentially exactly the same. The only difference is the arrangement of the code.
Advantages to the First Model
-
 - If you want to change the look of any given selector, you know exactly where to find the rules: they're under that selector! In addition, all the rules are in the same place so there's no need to traverse lines and lines (or files and files) of CSS code.
 - Better readability. When someone reads your code, they'll have a better idea of what an `h1` looks like because all the rules are right there.
 - Selectors are independent. Changing a rule of one selector doesn't affect any other selectors. (Though, this could be seen as a disadvantage; see bullet #1 for the second model.)

Advantages to the Second Model
-
 - Promotes page uniformity and site uniformity. If you want to change an aspect of your theme (e.g., `font-weight` of the first 4 headings), you only have to change it once, rather than in multiple places.
 - It's **DRY** (don't repeat yourself). Leaves less room for mistakes, bugs, and surprises.
 - Harbors a smaller file size. Fewer characters implies fewer bytes.

Finally, My Question
=
First off, can anyone think of any more advantages to either model? Please comment.

Now, **in terms of best practice, which model is preferred?** I'm looking for answers that take into account multiple dimensions such as load speed, readability, forward-compatibility, etc.

Some of the items are floated left and some are floated right (those to the right are admin options and appear on every page, while those on the left are context specific.  Each menu item has borders that make them appear as raised buttons.  I'd like a spacer item between the left and right floated items that is also styled as a raised button.

My problem is that I can't figure out how (in a pure CSS way, represented by the ""ul.menu li.spacer"" selector in the CSS below) to make the spacer's width stretch to fill the available space between the left and right floated items.  The spacer's width will be different depending on the context since the number and widths of the other items varies depending on context.

I could write some javascript to dynamically set the spacer's width, but that would have to be browser specific, since different browsers treat borders/margins differently and I don't want to have to do that, and would get REALLY ugly.

",css,menu,horizontal,,,,open,0,428,7,"dynamic width spacer in CSS horizontal menu I've got a simple horizontal menu (see below).  Some of the items are floated left and some are floated right (those to the right are admin options and appear on every page, while those on the left are context specific.  Each menu item has borders that make them appear as raised buttons.  I'd like a spacer item between the left and right floated items that is also styled as a raised button.

My problem is that I can't figure out how (in a pure CSS way, represented by the ""ul.menu li.spacer"" selector in the CSS below) to make the spacer's width stretch to fill the available space between the left and right floated items.  The spacer's width will be different depending on the context since the number and widths of the other items varies depending on context.

I could write some javascript to dynamically set the spacer's width, but that would have to be browser specific, since different browsers treat borders/margins differently and I don't want to have to do that, and would get REALLY ugly.

[Note that the floated right items are listed in reverse order they will appear on the screen, because of the float right]

The other thing I don’t understand is that while the left side of the tab is affected when I click on the <a> in Firebug (in the following line) it is ext-tab-right and not ext-tab-left that highlights on the page.  `<a onclick=”return false;” href=”#”><em><span><span>New England</span></span></em></a>`

Here's a fragment of the html ....



      <div id=""footer""><!-- footer -->

        </div>
       </div>

... and the CSS:


    .footer-left {
            background: url(/images//footer-left_.gif) no-repeat left top;
    }

I've created my sprite, and tried changing the CSS to:

    .footer-left {
    
          background:url('/images/sprites.gif')  -66px -2px no-repeat;
          width:20px;
          height:99px;
    }

The dimensions and offsets are correct, but the result isn't pretty. The sprite region shows in roughly the right place, but footer-logo.gif and the <p> text are messed up.

Any ideas please?

Everything works as expected in FF 3.5 and IE8.

The site is located at http://www.fencescapedesign.com/dev/Services.aspx

The issue appears when you hover over the ""Portfolio"" tab and move the mouse down over the 2nd/3rd sub menu item.  In IE6 and IE7 the menu instantly disappears, but only when over text (Services We Provide, or any links below).  It's possible to bring up the drop down and slowly mouse around the right edge and not have it disappear until you move the mouse left and over text.  

I've tried various changes to the positioning and z-index of the elements and looking at similar SO questions but to no avail.  As I'm no CSS expert it's entirely possible that some other background element or positioning that I messed up is causing the issue.

The CSS in question is located at http://www.fencescapedesign.com/Styles/Site.css near line 200.

many people write css but they don't have good command for writing cross browser css which will display same output in various browser. it is not possible to test a site on different browser with different different version. so i need to know is there any library available or not for those people who may not write cross browser css.  the library will generate right & cross browser css after detecting browser just like Modernizr which will generate everything perfect for old browser which does not have support for html5 & css3.

i am finding easy way to generate cross browser css without giving much effort and knowledge.

But all the ones I know (and all the ones I've checked on [this question][1]) come at it from the ""CSS cookbook"" angle: here's a trick for doing this, another trick for doing that and a code snippet for doing the other.

But this doesn't help me at all when it comes to CSS debugging. Why do elements seem to ignore their child elements if they're floating? Why does a button de-align the layout here but an anchor doesn't? Why did putting a `<li>` in here suddenly cause the div to jump down by half the page? Why won't this damn tag listen to the `text-align: center;` command like everything else on the page!?

All these headaches lead me to think that I really need an understanding of how CSS works under the hood. I feel like a person trying to write a computer program by just copy-pasting code snippets without even knowing what a variable or a function is. No amount of one-shot tutorials on specific aspects of CSS are going to help me here. I need a ground-up and comprehensive overview on how exactly a browser constructs a display from CSS code. That way when I get a CSS bug, I can think through what the browser is doing and where it's going wrong, like I would in any programming language, rather than just staring dumbly at my screen and randomly commenting out statements until I get something close to what I want.

Does such a thing exist?

But all the ones I know (and all the ones I've checked on [this question][1]) come at it from the ""CSS cookbook"" angle: here's a trick for doing this, another trick for doing that and a code snippet for doing the other.

But this doesn't help me at all when it comes to CSS debugging. Why do elements seem to ignore their child elements if they're floating? Why does a button de-align the layout here but an anchor doesn't? Why did putting a `<li>` in here suddenly cause the div to jump down by half the page? Why won't this damn tag listen to the `text-align: center;` command like everything else on the page!?

All these headaches lead me to think that I really need an understanding of how CSS works under the hood. I feel like a person trying to write a computer program by just copy-pasting code snippets without even knowing what a variable or a function is. No amount of one-shot tutorials on specific aspects of CSS are going to help me here. I need a ground-up and comprehensive overview on how exactly a browser constructs a display from CSS code. That way when I get a CSS bug, I can think through what the browser is doing and where it's going wrong, like I would in any programming language, rather than just staring dumbly at my screen and randomly commenting out statements until I get something close to what I want.

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
      <title>Site title</title>
      <%= stylesheet_link_tag    ""application"", :media => ""all"" %>
      <%= javascript_include_tag ""application"" %>
      <%= csrf_meta_tags %>
    </head>
    <body>
    <div class=""container"">
	<div class=""content"">
		<%= yield %>
	</div>
	<%= render 'layouts/footer' %> 
    </div>
    </body>
    </html>

**pages.css.scss**

    .container {
		width: 800px;
		height: 640px;
		position: absolute;
		left: 50%;
		top: 50%;
		margin-top: -320px;
		margin-left: -400px;
		background-image: url(amber1.jpg); 
		background-repeat: no-repeat; 
		background-color: black;
		font-family: times new roman, serif;
		text-align: center;
		}

Thas is the layout that i want to accomplish, kind of, I am having troubles having thos two columns together but the first one longer than the second, and getting them inside the white div.

so..

div1: is just a div with auto height and black bg  
div2: the same as div1 but white bg  
div3 and div4 are divs with auto height too, and grey bg at some point div 4 could be longer than div 3 or the other way around, these columns can increse in height therefore div1 and div2 should stretch  
div5-8 are just images.

I am able to get this positioning of the divs, but they wont stay into the white div (when i float left div 3)
they show up like div 3 was on top of the white and black divs, and if i make it longer it stretches more than the div1 and 2

Or I can also get them all inside the white div, but without floating left div4 which doesnt help =/

I know has to be some positioning problem, but I've tried some combinations and they wont work, at this point I am not using any position relative or anything.

help is appreciated.

        width: 100% - 10px;
    }

Can either of these be done?",2

Nathan Smith (the creator or 960.gs) came up with adapt.js some time ago, and by examining the bundled stylesheets ([mobile.css][2], [720.css][3] and [960.css][4] to name a few) it's clear that the number of grid columns is untouched, only the widths of the individual columns and the way they stack together change.

**[978.gs][5]** on the other hand seems to follow a different pattern:

 - the 300px grid has 8 columns
 - both the 748px and 978px grids have 12 columns
 - both the 1218px and 1378px grids have 16 columns

At first, I though this didn't make much sense so I talked to the developer about it. He replied by stating that it's common practice to serve different CSS ***and** different markups* depending on the device width.

This approach still seems a bit strange to me, because if you're willing to rewrite your whole HTML markup you might as well use the same grid system (16 for instance) and just change all your `.grid_{x}` classes to `.grid_{x*2}` to accommodate smaller screens... Right?

The adapt.js approach seems easier to implement and manage, but I can spot a few caveats too: how will an image or snippet of text fit nicely inside a `grid_3` class? Being that its width can range from `auto`, to `220px` to even `610px` in the [2520.css][6] variant?

So, what is the current best practice regarding responsive web design and grid systems? And should CSS media queries affect the grid (column widths)? As it is, I'm inclined to believe that the best approach might be to serve a single markup and stylesheet and let the browser do it's rendering / scaling.

I'm pretty green at this, so any help is appreciated -- thanks.

",css,internet-explorer-8,autocomplete,absolute-positioning,,,open,0,470,7,"CSS Issue with JQuery Autocomplete in IE8 Im getting a really weird problem which im pretty sure is due to 'positioning'.

Basically i've got a master page, which contains a container div, and has its position set to absolute, and using this it fills in margins along the side of the page. I'm then trying to use jQuery AutoComplete on a page, which itself has the position set to absolute, but when I select an item from the list, it reduces the margins, and its as though the absolute position on the page is removed/overriden, until typing something in the input box.

Using Firefox and Chrome there is no issue, and they work as expected.

I've managed to replicate my problem a bit simpler:

I have a ""Container"" div (with a white background), then a top-bar, left-bar, and right-bar div inside the container.

left-bar and right-bar are both floated inside ""Container"".

However, if you look in the image below you can see the right-bar has the grey background showing beneath it.  If ""Container"" is truly containing both top, left and right bar then it should be the containers background which shows through and the bottom should all be at a uniform level with a white color.

Instead, it seems that container isn't fully containing the left & right bar and therefore the actual body background shows through on the bottom of the right bar.

How can I make the ""container"" truly contain the divs inside it so the grey background will not show up underneath my right-panel and create my uneven level at the bottom?

I have a ""Container"" div (with a white background), then a top-bar, left-bar, and right-bar div inside the container.

left-bar and right-bar are both floated inside ""Container"".

However, if you look in the image below you can see the right-bar has the grey background showing beneath it.  If ""Container"" is truly containing both top, left and right bar then it should be the containers background which shows through and the bottom should all be at a uniform level with a white color.

Instead, it seems that container isn't fully containing the left & right bar and therefore the actual body background shows through on the bottom of the right bar.

on a huge enough display, maximized, it looks great.

this is what i want to prevent. (in explanation: red being the menu, blue being the logo)

so the first idea was to shift the red div the needed pixels of the blue div to the right, using padding-left:??px;

in other words: the scroll bar becomes visible far to early. it's ought to appear just when the window is smaller than the sum of pixels of the red and blue div together. and not, like in img 4, where it appears just when the window is smaller than the sum of pixels of the red div and *both* divs right and left from it). 

so what i want is that:
two divs, not overlapping (even when resizing), the right one at a fixed size, the left one in the center of the window, whithout creating a ghost div, creating blank space on low resolutions.

The way I've got it works fine in all modern browsers, but in IE 6 the overflowing Middle/Top section causes the width of the Middle/Main section to expand an contain it. 

Does anyone know of a way to fix this?

This web application needs to work specifically in IE 8.  I've tried several different combinations of ""float:left;"" ""clear:both"" and ""display:inline-block"" to try and achieve my desired layout but I'm obviously doing something wrong.

I've put red borders around all of the DIVs to help me try and figure this out as you can see in the picture below.

The first two sections are lining up correctly.  It's the ""Address"" section that I'm having trouble with (this section starts with ""Residence Address:"").

I want to have the following on their own line:<br>
Residence Address;<br> 
Residence Town, State/Province, ZIP;<br>
Same as Residence?;<br>
Mailing Address;<br>
Mailing Town, Mailing State/Province, ZIP;

I also want the enclosing DIV to only be as wide as the widest line which I've read can be accomplished with ""display:inline-block"".

For some reason, when I use ""display:inline-block"" and I float the enclosing DIV left, the lines with multiple elements on them (i.e. Residence Town, State/Province, ZIP) don't stay on one line - the ZIP usually wraps to a lower line even when the browser is maximized.

I hope I've been clear here but I can certainly clarify further if needed.

Thanks.

    }

I would almost settle for this, but I need the hitbox to be a specific size, so the :hover must be applied to my hitbox div. Is there any reason why this works for one div and not another?

Here's the markup code:

 

    <!-- container --> <div id=""feature_1_container"">
    <!-- shade --> <div id=""feature_1_shade""></div>
    <!-- text and arrow --> <div id=""feature_1_text_container""><h3 id=""feature_1_arrow"">Memberships</h3><p id=""feature_1_text"">Text here text here</p></div>
    <!-- image --> <div id=""feature_1_graphic""></div>
    <!-- hitbox --> <a href=""#""><div id=""feature_1_hitbox""></div></a>

    </div> <!-- #feature_1_container -->

Here's the CSS:

    #feature_1_container {
	width: 289px;
	height: 255px;
	float: left;
    }

    #feature_1_hitbox {
	width: 289px;
	height: 166px;
	margin: 89px 0 0 0;
	position: absolute;
	/* background-color: #F99; */

	width: 289px;
	height: 255px;
	position: absolute;
	background-image: url(site_style_images/feature_1_memberships_bag.png);
    }

    #feature_1_text_container {
	width: 289px;
	margin: 100px 0 0 0;
	position: absolute;
    }

    #feature_1_text {

After searching I see that you have to do it with CSS, but how? I feel that if I set something in CSS to be to the left, all text goes to the left.

Say I have a list of daily exercise tips.  Instead of an image to the left, I want to show the ""Day"" of the tip.  Like this:

4  Lift some weights --> <br />
3  Do some squats -->  <br />
2  Do some pushups -->  <br />
1  Stretch your muscles -->  <br />

Assume in the ""tips"" model, there's a field for ""Day"", just like there's a field for content. Day is a number.

So, instead of this current code (which works to put a img to the left)

If I replace the img src line with <!-- <h2><%= tip.day %></h2> it just puts the number on **TOP** of the tip, and both are left justified.  Two lines.

Any ideas?

For example, I'm currently working on an application with a status bar representing the status of a file transfer. It's used in three different locations, each of which is a different size.   In addition, if the transfer fails, the bar should be a different color.

What's the best approach, in general:

1. Add ""statusbar"" and ""transfer-failed"" classes to the divs independently, and check for their combined existence?
2. Have ""statusbar"" and ""statusbar-failed"" classes, set the class appropriately, and use careful CSS structuring to avoid repeating code.
3. Have a ""statusbar"" class, then use context like the div being inside a ""summary"" table or a ""transfer-failed"" div to further specialise it.

If you view the [jsfiddle][1] I have created it will make a bit more sense. Or have a look at my highly technical mockup below.

![enter image description here][2]

I'm using :nth-child to clear every second li thus achieving the results I want. This is grand in all browsers except IE7 (big surprise). 

The reason I can't use jQuery or add extra classes to the markup is because it is dynamic content generated from a SOLR search which returns the li's as the search results. Also because the results get loaded in via AJAX I can't target them via JQuery (believe me I tried).

I don't mind how hacky the fix (if there is one) so long as it works.

![Firefox-1][2]    ![Firefox-2][3]

and here is how it is rendered in Chrome:

![Chrome-1][4]     ![Chrome-2][5]

As you can see, in Firefox it cuts up the long url at the bottom of the div so that all the text fits within the width of the div, and a vertical scroll bar is added.

In Chrome, it cuts off the last paragraph of text on the bottom and only adds a horizontal scroll bar.

Why is this, and is there a solution to remedy this?

or adding the following to the style sheet

    h3  { white-space:normal; }

or

    .h3  { white-space:normal; }

None of which works...any ideas? I could wrap it with line breaks but that's no good as it looks ugly if someone changes the orientation of their phone.

Thanks

This works on all browsers to expand the div vertically, and also displays the horizonal width correctly on Firefox, Chrome, and IE7/8. However, on Safari, a horizontal scroll appears, and scrolls about 600px of blank space to the right.
