Now, notice there is no comma between ui-widget-content and  ui-state-default. What does this class definition mean? 

if I define .ui-button .ui-widget-content .ui-state-default should it override the above definition if a .ui-button actually precedes the others in the class attribute of the element?

So I have the above layout. The left box should always be as small as possible, while the right one should take up the remaining space. That would normally be fine with a `float: left`.

The problem is that the right box can grow quite a lot, while the left one is pretty much guaranteed to be very small (yet varies in size, so needs to be flexible). If the right box grows, I need it to behave like this:

    ------------- --------------------------------------------------
    | some text | | quite a lot of text, actually, really quite a  |
    ------------- | bunch of it, you could say this is really      |

                  --------------------------------------------------

If I use a `float:left`, the right box will line-break under the left box if it contains a lot of text:

I have got it working and have been able to style it a bit but I am noticing a weird difference between my version and the sites.  Say I return ['cat','cate'] to jquery, I can only get either item in the input box if I click on the text of the word itself.  On the website or on facebook and other sites you can click on the entire highlighted area.  Another example of this is if you go to the main page of SO and under favourite tags search for `html`, you can click on the text itself or you can click on the whitespace and it'll still put html in your search box.

To test it,  I added the following styling:

    .ui-autocomplete {
        list-style: none;
        width: 100px;
        height:auto;
        margin-top: 0px;

        cursor: pointer;
      }

Another example of this is if you go to the main page of SO and under favourite tags search for `html`, you can click on the text itself or you can click on the whitespace and it'll still put html in your search box.

To test it,  I added the following styling:

    .ui-autocomplete {
        list-style: none;
        width: 100px;
        height:auto;
        margin-top: 0px;
        padding: 0px;
        margin-left: 0px;
      }
      .ui-menu-item:hover {
        background-color: #006699;
        cursor: pointer;
      }

When I hoover on the entire row, the mouse pointer changes so it obviously knows its on a row but I cannot click on it unless I click on the text.   I'm really new to web development and I'm not sure how to classify it so sorry if this is not a css issue.

  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/l3EVa.png",css,drop-down-menu,,,,,open,0,913,12,"Adding a drop down horizontal menu to the ASP.NET MVC 2 template I am wanting to add a menu look and operation similar to [this blog post][1]. I am not using HTML5 and I am not using CSS3. Also, I am a CSS n00b and don't really grasp what each tag does (or can do) so I feel like I am drowning here in understanding what to do. I have been scouring the net looking for an example of what I want to do and have had no luck beyond the link above. 

This is the ""standard"" ASP.NET MVC 2 template. We actually like the look for our internal applications. But the menu is something that needs help yet.

Here is what I have working so far:

The design I am working on is based around a 100% height layout.  
A site page always has an image.  
Which can only ever be 800px in height.  
A max-height of 100% is set on this image.

The results in a site that works nicely on large monitors, but on smaller screens the images will adjust meaning the site always fits nicely. 

-

Because the site uses a horizontal scroll, I am making use of a position: fixed, on the #footer nav, to position the navigation in the bottom right.

However, when the screen has a height greater than 800px, this footer #nav remains in the bottom right corner. 

I am trying to find a solution that would allow this fixed element, to be fixed, relative to the height of the container div. Meaning the navigation is always 1em above the bottom of the site layout.

Which can only ever be 800px in height.  
A max-height of 100% is set on this image.

The results in a site that works nicely on large monitors, but on smaller screens the images will adjust meaning the site always fits nicely. 

-

Because the site uses a horizontal scroll, I am making use of a position: fixed, on the #footer nav, to position the navigation in the bottom right.

However, when the screen has a height greater than 800px, this footer #nav remains in the bottom right corner. 

I am trying to find a solution that would allow this fixed element, to be fixed, relative to the height of the container div. Meaning the navigation is always 1em above the bottom of the site layout.

Bootstrap can format your forms quite nicely - as long as you have the CSS classes it expects included.

However, my issue is that the forms generated by Django's {{ form.as_p }} don't render well with Bootstrap, as they don't have these classes. For example, the output from Django:

    <form class=""horizontal-form"" action=""/contact/"" method=""post"">
    <div style='display:none'
    <input type='hidden' name='csrfmiddlewaretoken' value='26c39ab41e38cf6061367750ea8c2ea8'/>
    </div>
    <p><label for=""id_name"">Name:</label> <input id=""id_name"" type=""text"" name=""name"" value=""FOOBAR"" maxlength=""20"" /></p>
    <p><label for=""id_directory"">Directory:</label> <input id=""id_directory"" type=""text"" name=""directory"" value=""FOOBAR"" maxlength=""60"" /></p>
    <p><label for=""id_comment"">Comment:</label> <textarea id=""id_comment"" rows=""10"" cols=""40"" name=""comment"">Lorem ipsum dolor sic amet.</textarea></p>
    <p><label for=""id_server"">Server:</label> <select name=""server"" id=""id_server"">
        <option value="""">---------</option>
        <option value=""1"" selected=""selected"">sydeqexcd01.au.db.com</option>
        <option value=""2"">server1</option>
        <option value=""3"">server2</option>
        <option value=""4"">server3</option>
    </select></p>
    <input type=""submit"" value=""Submit"" />
    </form>

From what I can tell, Bootstrap requires that your forms has a <fieldset class=""control-group"">, each <label> has class=""control-label"", and each <input> is wrapped in a <div>:


    <fieldset class=""control-group"">
        <label class=""control-label"" for=""input01"">Text input</label>
        <div class=""controls"">
            <input type=""text"" class=""xlarge"" name=""input01"">
            <p class=""help-text"">Help text here. Be sure to fill this out like so, or else!</p>
        </div>
    </fieldset>

However, adding custom CSS labels to every form field in Django is rather painful:

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/414679/add-class-to-django-label-tag-output 

Is there a smarter way of either using {{ form.as_p }}, or iterating through the fields, without having to manually specify things, or do a whole bunch of hackery?

From what I can tell, Bootstrap requires that your forms has a <fieldset class=""control-group"">, each <label> has class=""control-label"", and each <input> is wrapped in a <div>:


    <fieldset class=""control-group"">
        <label class=""control-label"" for=""input01"">Text input</label>
        <div class=""controls"">
            <input type=""text"" class=""xlarge"" name=""input01"">
            <p class=""help-text"">Help text here. Be sure to fill this out like so, or else!</p>
        </div>
    </fieldset>

However, adding custom CSS labels to every form field in Django is rather painful:

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/414679/add-class-to-django-label-tag-output 

Is there a smarter way of either using {{ form.as_p }}, or iterating through the fields, without having to manually specify things, or do a whole bunch of hackery?

However, I've been through threads and I can't seem to find a solution to my situation. It's probably something very minute that I'm missing, or perhaps I'm just barking up the wrong tree all together.

Basically what I'm trying to do is take an anchor with a {display:block;} with a set height and width and have its text be vertically and horizontally centered.

    	text-align:center;
    	font-size:15px;
    	font-weight:bold;
    	color:#c60606;

      purposes.

        margin-top:10px;
    }

and then the html would be

    <div class=""logo""><a href=""#""><div>my link</div></a></div>


Now the reason i stuck a div inside of the anchor is because I thought it would be a good way to separate the text from the actual block, but with that margin setting it moves the anchor down instead of just the text. The vertical-align attribute does basically nothing, and I'm at a loss in terms of what to do. Any suggestions or restructuring ideas would be great. Thank you.

What you're seeing in the picture is the top of a website container - the ""links"" are part of the main menu.

For instance, during a given keyframe, I'd like to animate opacity from 0 to 1 with an ease-in timing function, and top from 0 to 100 with a linear timing function.

This is possible with CSS transitions, by doing something like the below.  (Unfortunately I need keyframed animations for other reasons.)

    -webkit-transition-property: opacity, top;
    -webkit-timing-function: ease-in, linear;

Also, I noticed (at [this link][1]) that the specification for the animation-timing-function property accepts a comma delimited list.  However, I don't see any way to specify a corresponding list of properties or any documentation on what the purpose of a list of timing functions is.

This is possible with CSS transitions, by doing something like the below.  (Unfortunately I need keyframed animations for other reasons.)

    -webkit-transition-property: opacity, top;
    -webkit-timing-function: ease-in, linear;

Also, I noticed (at [this link][1]) that the specification for the animation-timing-function property accepts a comma delimited list.  However, I don't see any way to specify a corresponding list of properties or any documentation on what the purpose of a list of timing functions is.  Does anyone know if what I'm trying to do is possible?

It looks great and thanks to the font-squirrel it works on all browsers.

However, I realized later that the fonts rendered differently in some browsers. Chrome, Opera and Safari all render the custom font slightly higher than others. This is not that big of an issue there, but when trying to add another page http://monkey-touch.com/sandbox/products.php with the custom font of a big size, the offset becomes larger to the point where it is very much a nuisance as the text renders outside of the divs. 

Please note that the issue apparently has nothing to do with faulty css styling of other divs as even rendering the font in the body tag with no other divs has the offset as can be seen here: http://monkey-touch.com/Sandbox2/

Can anyone tell me why this is and what the best way is to fix the issue?
