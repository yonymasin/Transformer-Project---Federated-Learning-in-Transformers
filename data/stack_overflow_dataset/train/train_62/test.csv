Let's say I have an admin application that displays sales stats in different ways.  The remote method looks like:

	  <mx:method name=""getSalesStats"" fault=""getSalesStatsFault(event)"" 
	  	result = ""getSalesStatsSuccess(event)"" />

But some things need to change based on more than just what I get back from the server.  If this was a synchronous call, it would be easy; I'd do something like: 

    function buttonOneClick():void {
       myData1:ArrayCollection = getSalesStats(120, ""peanuts"");
       myChart.dataProvider = myData1;
    }
    
    function buttonTwoClick():void {
       myData2:ArrayCollection = getSalesStats(120, ""cashews"");
       myDataGrid.dataProvider = myData2; 
    }

I'd like to pass something through the remote method to the responding function, like: 

    rpt.getSalesStats(120, ""peanuts"", ""clicked button one"");

but that of course throws an error because the server doesn't want that last argument.  Any thoughts?  I'll clarify if this is confusing.. ",2

When you run the above code in a flex project, it should repeatedly print, character by character, the sentence ""The big brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."". But, if you are typing into the textarea at the same time, you will notice the text the timer prints is distorted.

I am really curious as to why this happens. The single-threaded nature of flex and disabling user input for the textarea when I make modifications should prevent this from happening, but for some reason this doesn't seem to be working.

I must note too that, when running the timer at larger intervals (around 100ms) it seems to work perfectly, so I am tempted to think it's some kind of synchronization issue in the internals of the flex framework.

Any ideas on what could be causing the problem?

I have written a cutsom item renderer based on the DataGroup spark component.  Each row in the grid has multiple entities to display, the x position and width of the entites are based on the data of the entity itself.

I have a custom layout written for the DataGroup that measures and posistions each entity based on its data. Each entity in each row can either truncate or not truncate its label.  When the labels are not truncated, I calculate the actual width of the object and validate its size manualy (to force the label to have the correct width and layout all its text lines and remeasure itself) within the DataGroup's Layout's measure method to accurately measure the datagroup itself.

The layouts, measuring, sizing, display, etc all work correctly.  The entitys report the correct height they need when not truncating the labels, the datagroup reports the correct size it needs to draw all of its row's worth of entities (all from measure methods like they need to under the UIComponent lifecycle).

When inside the AdvancedDataGrid itself, rows are not sized correctly.  The majority of the rows do not require multiple lines and display just fine.  Those that require multiple lines have larger row heights, but not large enough to accomodate the entire text in most cases.  The DataGroup for that row (and its itemRenderers) are clipped.  Furthermore, When scrolling the grid, every row scrolled onscreen is the default 1 text line height, irregardless of data.  In any case, resizing the AdvancedDataGrid (not resizing its columns, but the grid itself) forces all rows to snap to the correct desired height.  Scrolling again produces incorreclty sized rows.

Additionally, the layout of each entity in the row is determined by several external factors - most commonly being visible range (along the horizontal).  Changing this visible range will trigger all item renderers to resize themselves (through the custom layout class) to their new sizes and remeasuring the new DataGroup layout.  This actually triggers a custom hierarchy parser which rebuilds all the ArrayCollections used inside the AdvandedDataGrid data provider, so ArrayCollections are dispatching change events that each row's DataGroup reacts to, so the DataGroup itself is invalidating its size and layout.

These resizes do not trigger the AdvancedDataGrid to remeasure its row heights, and I must rezise the ADG itself again to snap the rows to the correct height.

Anyone have any experience with dynamically sized rows in an AdvancedDataGrid or ItemRenderers which must forcibly make the AdvandedDataGrid re-layout its rows?

Unfortunately, I cannot provide source code as there are a huge number of classes going into this, hierarchial data, rolling up closed nodes into multiple rows, custom hierarchy parsers, a multitude of item renderers  - that and its a Government contract.


I have run into a similar issue with a much simpler item renderer, basically a label that will respect a max height, resize itself upto that height as its wordwrapping data will require, and then create scrollbars for itself.  Again, the data sizes almost correclty when the grid is created, then changing the column width within the grid does not resize the row height as the item renderer adjusts to its new width.  Only in resizing the grid itself do the item renderers resize correctly, create scroll bars, and the grids row heights are correct.  The source for that item renderer:

",flex,objects,arraycollection,as3,,,open,0,884,9,"Two Objects created with the same Address in Flex I have an issue in flex which is causing a bit of a headache!

I am adding objects to an ArrayCollection but in doing so, another ArrayCollection is also picking up these changes even though there is no binding occurring. 

I can see from the debug that the two ACs have the same address but for the life of me can't figure out why.

I have two Array Collections:

    model.index.rows //The main array collection

    model.index.holdRows //The array collection that imitates the above

This phantom data binding occurs only for the first iteration in the loop and for all others it will just write it the once.

The reason this is proving troublesome is that it creates duplicate entries in my datagrid.
