What can be the cause of this problem?
I think I should get ABSOLUTELY the same output in both cases, isnt it??

Works fine so far, the data is updated and the standard property change event is dispatched.

The only problem I've got now is that the myModel value property doesn't change any more (I suppose because I stored the objects in the ArrayCollection). 

The ArrayCollection is marked bindable as well btw, because new object instances of myModel can be added during runtime.

This will remove me having both spark and mx forms in my application. 

Alternatively is it possible to make mx forms position horizontally?

After that maven was able to communicate to the repositories but unable to download all the files. I did try deleting the 'repository' directory couple of times, and also tried re-installing maven software.

Because, it could not download the files I thought may be I should try copying the files manually into the default repository location (<HOME_DIR>/.m2/repository) and did that. But still I get an error as below.

None of the errors are related to the related to the changes made in the above file.  The above file does not reference any of the files mentioned in the error and the files in the error do no reference the file that was modified.  

I have had a similar issue while editing this file in other places (for example xml adding comments).  The interesting thing is that not all additions break the file, just some.  For the life of me I cannot find a pattern of changes that break the file.  They seems random.  

The only thing that I can think of that may be causing me an issue is the encoding of the file??  Eariler today I copied the file from Eclipse into another opened Eclipse workspace.  Later I copied it from Eclipse -> Notepad++ and back to Eclipse.  Is it possible the file ecoding or line breaks or something like that was corrupted?  

Anyone else ever have issues like this?  How did you resolve them?  I am tempted to retype the file 100% in Eclipse to see if the problem remains or disapears but the file is very long so I am trying to avoid this (plus I am not convinced that it will work).

We had a similar issue a few weeks ago that ""went away by itself"".  Everyone on my team was having serious issues building the project.  When no changes made to the code base the build would fail sometimes and succeed soemtimes.  This issue seems to have disapeared and my current issue requires a code changed to fail but I thought I would include this in case it might provide some insight.

None of the errors are related to the related to the changes made in the above file.  The above file does not reference any of the files mentioned in the error and the files in the error do no reference the file that was modified.  

I have had a similar issue while editing this file in other places (for example xml adding comments).  The interesting thing is that not all additions break the file, just some.  For the life of me I cannot find a pattern of changes that break the file.  They seems random.  

The only thing that I can think of that may be causing me an issue is the encoding of the file??  Eariler today I copied the file from Eclipse into another opened Eclipse workspace.  Later I copied it from Eclipse -> Notepad++ and back to Eclipse.  Is it possible the file ecoding or line breaks or something like that was corrupted?  

Anyone else ever have issues like this?  How did you resolve them?  I am tempted to retype the file 100% in Eclipse to see if the problem remains or disapears but the file is very long so I am trying to avoid this (plus I am not convinced that it will work).

We had a similar issue a few weeks ago that ""went away by itself"".  Everyone on my team was having serious issues building the project.  When no changes made to the code base the build would fail sometimes and succeed soemtimes.  This issue seems to have disapeared and my current issue requires a code changed to fail but I thought I would include this in case it might provide some insight.  

Thanks!

I have a few Buttons which may or may not dispatch events based on the state of related components (e.g. `DataGrid` or `List`), and I'm trying to figure out if the logic is simple enough to simply embed in one of the Event attributes in the MXML.

Here's how I've been doing things:

    <mx:Script>
        <![CDATA[
            private function sendEvent1():void {
                if (list.selectedIndex != -1) {

        ]]>
    </mx:Script>
    <mx:List id=""list"" dataProvider={listData} />
    <mx:Button label=""Click!"" click=""sendEvent1()"" />

In this example, the ActionScript contained in the Script tag contains the logic for determining whether or not the event should be dispatched.

The Button, however, can be modified a bit, removing the need for the `sendEvent1` function:

    <mx:Button label=""Click!"" click=""if (list.selectedIndex != -1) dispatchEvent(new Event(""click!"")"" />

Ignoring some of the obvious issues in these snippets (e.g. static strings, missing code for the data provider, etc.), there are a few concerns I have with the second example:

* The MXML is less readable (it gets long and cluttered)
* As more function calls are required for clicking the Button, the logic in the MXML becomes much more unwieldy.
* Embedding logic in the MXML makes it less intuitive (for me at least).  If I want to know the logic of the MXML, I'm more inclined to look in the `Script` tag, where I expect the ActionScript.

Are there other pros behind inserting logic in an MXML attribute?

Ignoring some of the obvious issues in these snippets (e.g. static strings, missing code for the data provider, etc.), there are a few concerns I have with the second example:

* The MXML is less readable (it gets long and cluttered)
* As more function calls are required for clicking the Button, the logic in the MXML becomes much more unwieldy.
* Embedding logic in the MXML makes it less intuitive (for me at least).  If I want to know the logic of the MXML, I'm more inclined to look in the `Script` tag, where I expect the ActionScript.

Are there other pros behind inserting logic in an MXML attribute?  I've been seeing this use more and more often, and I want to make sure I'm not missing any compelling reasons to change how I've been doing things.",2

When a user edit's a cell, this function is called:


    private function verifyInputIsValid(event:DataGridEvent):void

    	// Check the reason for the event.
    	if (event.reason == DataGridEventReason.CANCELLED)

    		if(validatorResult.type==ValidationResultEvent.INVALID){

    			// Write a message to the errorString property. 
    			// This message appears when the user mouses over the editor.

Of course, for this to work, the `resultHandler` of the `remoteObjectValidationService` would need to be invoked (and run) before we exit the `verifyInputIsValid` function.  In a ""synchronous"" fashion.  I know [“All IO in Flex is asynchronous”][2] , but there must be a standard way to do something like this right?  I've already implemented my custom Validator and that works just fine.  

***How do Flex programmers validate on the server, immediately after the valid client-side validation passes?***


I realize it seems silly to search out this ""synchronous"" design and I hope someone has an answer to solve my problem with best practices.  In my defense, the reason I want to validate on the server immediately following client-side validation is so that I'm using Flex's validation framework.  If I get an invalid response from the server, I want to leverage the built-in UI components that Flex has to tell the user something is incorrect about his/her input.

Any ideas?

	<mxmlc
			file=""${app.dir}/${application.name}.mxml""
			output=""${dist.dir}/${application.name}.swf""
			context-root=""${application.name}""
			debug=""true""
            locale=""${locales}""
            allow-source-path-overlap=""true"">
			<load-config filename=""${FLEX_HOME}/frameworks/flex-config.xml""/>
			<compiler.library-path dir=""${lib.dir}"" append=""true"">
    			<include name=""*.swc"" />
			</compiler.library-path>
			<define name=""BUILD::BuildNumber"" value=""'20100707.800'""/>
			<source-path path-element=""${src.dir}""/>
			<source-path path-element=""${cfg.dir}""/>
            <source-path path-element=""${locale.dir}"" />
	</mxmlc>

Then i'm trying to retrieve with 

    public static const buildNumber:String = BUILD::BuildNumber;

However the compiler is rejecting with 

SomeModel.as(31): col: 47 Error: Access of undefined property BUILD.
    [mxmlc] 		 private static const _buildNumber:String = BUILD::BuildNumber;

Any suggestions?",5

I have a main application that fist load the fonts via a URL. This is the font file code:

    package{
	import flash.display.Sprite;
	import flash.text.Font;
	
	public class FontLib extends Sprite
	{
		
		[Embed(source=""MyriadPro-Regular.otf"", fontWeight= ""normal"", fontName=""Myriad Pro"", fontFamily=""Myriad Pro"",mimeType=""application/x-font"", embedAsCFF=""true"")]

		public function FontLib()
		{
			Font.registerFont(myriadFont);
			var fonts:Array = Font.enumerateFonts(false);
			trace('libsss',fonts); // This shows Verdana as a registered font
		}
	}}


That seems to work ok. As the trace shows the embedded font when the font swf is loaded.

    [SWF] /assets/FontLib.swf - 89,594 bytes after decompression libsss [object Font],[object FontLib_myriadFont]


Once the font swf is loaded I then load the fist module via a URL using ModuleLoader. In the module I execute the following code on creation complete to see if the fonts are loaded:

    protected function bookstoremodule1_creationCompleteHandler(event:FlexEvent):void
			{
				
				var fonts:Array = Font.enumerateFonts(false);
				trace('bs',fonts); // This shows Verdana as a registered font
			}

Thats loaded module seem to have picked up the font:

    load module success: bs [object FontLib_myriadFont]


However when I cannot get it to apply to a spark RichText component. Here is the mxml for it:

    <s:RichText fontLookup=""embeddedCFF"" renderingMode=""cff"" ai:aa=""2"" color=""#2F4160"" columnCount=""1"" fontFamily=""Myriad Pro"" fontSize=""18.0737"" height=""20"" d:id=""4"" kerning=""on"" tabStops=""S40.665699005127 S81.3313980102539 S121.997097015381 S162.662796020508"" text=""Shopping Cart (0)"" d:userLabel=""Shopping Cart (0)"" flm:variant=""1"" whiteSpaceCollapse=""preserve"" width=""168"" x=""53"" y=""12"" x.down=""54"" y.down=""13"" id=""richtext1"">

		</s:filters>
	</s:RichText>


The mxml definition is fine when the font is embedded directly in the module. It just stops working when the font is loaded as a swf. 

Any ideas? I have tried loads of things but still having no luck :(

That seems to work ok. As the trace shows the embedded font when the font swf is loaded.

    [SWF] /assets/FontLib.swf - 89,594 bytes after decompression libsss [object Font],[object FontLib_myriadFont]


Once the font swf is loaded I then load the fist module via a URL using ModuleLoader. In the module I execute the following code on creation complete to see if the fonts are loaded:

    protected function bookstoremodule1_creationCompleteHandler(event:FlexEvent):void
			{
				
				var fonts:Array = Font.enumerateFonts(false);
				trace('bs',fonts); // This shows Verdana as a registered font
			}

Thats loaded module seem to have picked up the font:

    load module success: bs [object FontLib_myriadFont]


However when I cannot get it to apply to a spark RichText component. Here is the mxml for it:

    <s:RichText fontLookup=""embeddedCFF"" renderingMode=""cff"" ai:aa=""2"" color=""#2F4160"" columnCount=""1"" fontFamily=""Myriad Pro"" fontSize=""18.0737"" height=""20"" d:id=""4"" kerning=""on"" tabStops=""S40.665699005127 S81.3313980102539 S121.997097015381 S162.662796020508"" text=""Shopping Cart (0)"" d:userLabel=""Shopping Cart (0)"" flm:variant=""1"" whiteSpaceCollapse=""preserve"" width=""168"" x=""53"" y=""12"" x.down=""54"" y.down=""13"" id=""richtext1"">
		<s:filters>
			<s:DropShadowFilter blurX=""0"" blurY=""0"" color=""#FFFFFF"" distance=""1.41421"" quality=""2""/>
		</s:filters>
	</s:RichText>


The mxml definition is fine when the font is embedded directly in the module. It just stops working when the font is loaded as a swf. 

Any ideas? I have tried loads of things but still having no luck :(

I have used a piece of code to interact with a backend SOAP service for several months - it works fine. I tried it out in a different project (first as an swc library and then just by cutting and pasting) and it just doesnt work.

If I try the exact same code in the original flex project, connecting to the same backend service, everything works fine. In the new project, I can call operations that take simple document-literal wrappers as params (they have no real parameters) - but if the operation has a complex parameter inside the document literal wrapper - fail on this new project. Here is a sample that would fail:

    var service:WebService = new WebService();
    service.wsdl = wsdlURL;
    var operation:AbstractOperation = service.getOperation( ""addNewUser"" );

    var param:XML = <AddNewUserRequest/>
    param.setNamespace( myNameSpace );
    
    param.user.username( username );
    param.user.email( email );

    var param:XML = <GetUsersRequest/>

Here are some things that I have done to try an track this one down:

-Examined the posts in firebug from both projects and can not see a difference (meaning that the code appears to generate the exact same SOAP request in both projects (as one expects)
-I have verified that the requests should work using SOAPui to directly query the web service

The back end service is an Apache CXF webservice and here is a sample of the error it generates:

> org.apache.cxf.interceptor.Fault: Found element {http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema}user but could not find matching RPC/Literal part

Everything I know leads me to believe that user should be in the http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema namespace - and honestly - I believe the key here is that the code works in one project but not in the other.

    12.I present my progress to customer, they are happy so far, can I still meet the deadline? Yeah I say.
    13.Mgr wants to see my progress
    14.Mgr says I shouldn't use unique seq_key as unique identifier, use emp id, rename foreign keys, add columns, etc..
    15.I rework db tables
    16.I rework code and components to reflect db column changes
    17.Now await mgr review, assuming more rework
    18.Now I will not make my deadline with customer

Does this happen to the majority of developers?. What am I doing wrong, how can i streamline this process, how can I be more efficient?

For quite a lot of time I have followed the paradigms, proposed by frameworks like Cairngorm - 

View, bound to properties of a singleton model, and dispatching events.
Events get caught by the front controller, and commands get executed as a result.
commands call services, get data, and supply the model.
The model implicitly updates the views through bindings.

It was all nice and sound until I got to the following data structure:

User
 has many followers (Users)
 follows many Users 
 has a bunch of photos
 follows many locations

Photo
 has many likers (User)
 has a location
 has a creator
 has many related photos

Location
 has many photos
 has many followers

Again, it would not be a problem to use the idea proposed by Cairngorm, for instance to have
a currentUser, currentLocation, and currentPhoto, and just bind to them. 

The problem comes in the views themselves. I have a series of complex ""page"" views, which provide as drilled information, as one could imagine. For instance, the location page, shows a grid of latest/popular photos, a panel for for followers, and a map of based on the coordinates where those photos were taken. Here come the problems:

Obviously, for performance reasons, I cannot fetch all users that are following a particular location, or all photos a location could have. I have pre-fetched some, and others will supplied by the server on demand.

I want to drill-down staying on the same view, for example when clicking on a follower's avatar page, i should get a small grid of that user's photos, or sth. But i only have one currentUser in the model.

This leads to the question, why do i even need to bind to a central singleton model? Can't I just turn every view into a sort-of responder, i.e the view dispatches an even again, but this time the command instead of supplying the model, will supply the calling view directly. 

There won't be any coupling because every view will implement IResponder. The command will require only an IResponder, which it will get from the Event it was called with.

The ""model"" as I see it, will play a different role. It will be more like a cache, a sort a global Dictionary for local storage, which will be checked by the command before it makes a request from the server. This way it may save some calls to the server, although, if the data is very sporadical, this same data will be fetched again and again together with other data. (I may have some user data in the cache, but in general I will call the server for a collection of follower data, regardless of whether some of it I might already have or not, for consistency )

3379406,07/31/2010 18:48:52,313366,03/07/2010 06:13:25,37,9,Why are virtual machine based RIA solutions so quickly rejected by proponents of legacy AJAX/DHTML patchwork solutions?,"RIA adoption rates in the corporate intranet world seem higher than that of the Internet because the cost-effectiveness and efficiency is being recognized there. (A growing number of job postings asking for Flex experience in my IT-heavy region demonstrates this.) Why not also on the Internet?

Reasons you get from people who favor hacked-together JavaScript/AJAX/DHTML solutions just don't hold up to scrutiny. For example you hear RIA 'downsides' like:

- Vendor lock-in... Using supposedly ""standard"" web techs you are still locked in to whatever JS framework tool you choose. What's the difference? It's even worse because the heavy competition between the multitude of ""AJAX frameworks"" means your FW of choice is more likely to be abandoned some day.

- Search engine indexing... This is an issue for AJAX websites (anything with very dynamic content) too, not just RIAs. And for static content, Google has been indexing SWF (Flex) content for some time now. Anyway, this is a problem for web-SITES, not web applications: two entirely different things. And deep-linking is not a problem for a Flash app, even basic research can dispel that myth.

- Performance/interoperability... Flash/Flex is JIT compiled. (If Silverlight isn't, I'm sure it will be eventually.) JavaScript is interpreted. Poor performance? Really? Flex runs in a platform independent **virtual machine**. Compared to the 'platform incompatibility' problem within browsers for AJAX scripts, saying a VM approach is not as cross platform is *completely backwards* thinking which completely ignores the browser wars and compatibility problems.

- Accessibility... Any large website needs to think about this. Contrary to what many believe, Flash has accessibility capabilities--it's not vastly harder like many claim, just different.

- Player 'upgrade nightmares'... Not an issue for a *consistent* backwards compatible platform like Flash. Actually the non-standard, inconsistent DOM and DHTML browser incompatibility problems common in AJAX applications seem like the real nightmare in comparison.

To make it worse, the list of ""downsides"" (such as O&M maintainability issues in response to new versions of browsers which break AJAX scripts) is much longer than any list of issues with virtual machine application deployment. Why do so many hesitate to adopt 21st century innovation and abandon the 1990's legacy JavaScript era? Is it just job security and learning fatigue from a rapidly evolving IT environment? What is the difference between the software and hardware world where they are adopting virtualization technologies so readily?",flex,flash,silverlight,ria,,08/03/2010 22:18:06,not constructive,1,388,17,"Why are virtual machine based RIA solutions so quickly rejected by proponents of legacy AJAX/DHTML patchwork solutions? RIA adoption rates in the corporate intranet world seem higher than that of the Internet because the cost-effectiveness and efficiency is being recognized there. (A growing number of job postings asking for Flex experience in my IT-heavy region demonstrates this.) Why not also on the Internet?

Reasons you get from people who favor hacked-together JavaScript/AJAX/DHTML solutions just don't hold up to scrutiny. For example you hear RIA 'downsides' like:

- Vendor lock-in... Using supposedly ""standard"" web techs you are still locked in to whatever JS framework tool you choose. What's the difference? It's even worse because the heavy competition between the multitude of ""AJAX frameworks"" means your FW of choice is more likely to be abandoned some day.

- Search engine indexing... This is an issue for AJAX websites (anything with very dynamic content) too, not just RIAs. And for static content, Google has been indexing SWF (Flex) content for some time now. Anyway, this is a problem for web-SITES, not web applications: two entirely different things. And deep-linking is not a problem for a Flash app, even basic research can dispel that myth.

- Performance/interoperability... Flash/Flex is JIT compiled. (If Silverlight isn't, I'm sure it will be eventually.) JavaScript is interpreted. Poor performance? Really? Flex runs in a platform independent **virtual machine**. Compared to the 'platform incompatibility' problem within browsers for AJAX scripts, saying a VM approach is not as cross platform is *completely backwards* thinking which completely ignores the browser wars and compatibility problems.

What i would like is that the last button has a 10 pixel horizontalGap so it stands apart from the rest of the buttons. I would also like for it to be a bit smaller than the other buttons. Is it possible to do it or should i try a different approach? I also tried to just define it as a seperate button but then you loose the effect of a pushed in button.",2

I was wondering if it is possible to make and App capable of listening when the user ""adds"" new files to a directory.

Example:

 1. The User opens up our Application.
 2. The user adds new files on the desktop (using the Microsoft Explorer).
 3. Our application automatically detects that new files have been added and executes a function or whatever.


Sound interesting right?

Maybe, this could be done using a programming language like Visual Basic and open the executable with the NativeProcess api and listen for an stdOut event... (:

Anyone got and idea to share with us? :)
