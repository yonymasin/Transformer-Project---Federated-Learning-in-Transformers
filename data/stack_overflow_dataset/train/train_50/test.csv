I have another error in below code. There are lots of struct definitons in this header. I give small part of it which gives error. The error is **""error: 'RFID_PACKET_CALLBACK_FUNCTION' does not name a type""**.

This means that there is no way to get access to a node's data for a given key from a `tdelete()` call. One would be required to call `tfind()` (rather than `tsearch()` so as not to add the given key), perform destruction of the node's data, and then call `tdelete()` with the same key to remove the node from the binary tree.

Have I interpreted this correctly? Is there some way around what I perceive to be limitations with this approach?

 1. If the key is heap-allocated, it can't be freed (or made useless to the comparison function in use) before the node is deleted. This requires calling `tfind()` to obtain a pointer to the data, `tdelete()` to remove the node, and then destroying the data retrieved from the `tfind()` call.
 2. Two lookups are required to delete a node and destroy it's enclosed data.

To be honest I find new2.h confusing. As I said I copied the functions from the pdf.
Here is what I think happens:

 1. new2 is called. The argument String tells the computer to make a pointer to a Class struct and point it to the String struct already created in new2.h.
 2. we allocate enough memory for a String object.
 3. We call the constructor (String_ctor), and use the variable argument list to get the char argument, in this case ""a"".

My understanding is fuzzy, and this code doesn't compile. Any help would be appreciated!

Why does this rounding used by default in `C`, `Perl`, `Ruby` and `Bash`, but not in `Haskell`?

Is it some sort of tradition or standard? And if it is a standard, why it's used by those languages and not used by `Haskell`? What is a point of rounding half to even?

Why isn't an expression of the kind `((type_t *) x)` considered a valid lvalue, assuming that `x` itself is a pointer and an lvalue, not just some expression?

I know many will say ""the standard disallows it"", but from a logical standpoint it seems reasonable. What is the reason that the standard disallows it? After all, any two pointers are of the same size and the pointer type is just a compile-time abstraction that indicates the appropriate offset that should be applied when doing pointer arithmetic.

After all, any two pointers are of the same size and the pointer type is just a compile-time abstraction that indicates the appropriate offset that should be applied when doing pointer arithmetic.

What's required...
There is only one stage on this project, writing the spellCheck routine. The spellCheck function has two parameters. The first parameter (article[]) is a pointer to an array of characters. The contents of this array are an article that you need to spell check. The end of the article is marked with the normal 0 (marking the end of a string). The article includes punctuation, upper and lower case words, numbers, and abbreviations. Your function must print every word in the article that cannot be found in the dictionary. The dictionary is the second parameter to the function (more on this later).

 3. foo.value(&foo, value) functions (like C++ class methods)
 4. Separate header files for same struct exposing public members for client and all members internally

I would like it to work in the following manner. One piece of software will start running as the server, it will be performing a variety of functions including listening for a socket connection on a designated port. This software will function by it self and only use data from the connected network socket when it is established and receiving reliable data. So for this piece I would like to be able to listen to a connection, and when one is made fork a process and when data is received from this socket set some variable that will be used by some other update thread to notify it that it has these extra precision information that can be considered. On the other side of this equation I want to create a program that when it boots up will attempt to connect to the port of the other application, once this connects it will then simply call a function that will send out the information in non blocking fashion. My whole goal is to create a connector that will allow the programmers of the other two pieces of code to feel as tho they aren't dealing with a socket what so ever.
      I have been able to get multi threaded socket communication going but I am now trying to modify this so it will be usable as I have described and I am confused as to how to avoid multiple access to that variable that will notify the system on the server side that the data has arrived as well as create the non-blocking interaction on the client side.

What I have understood so far is the primary reason to use them is a performance boost gained due to the fact that data is now stored in video memory.

For instance, all of what I have seen has been setting up one Vertex Buffer Object and drawing one triangle or one cube, etc. What if I want to draw 2 or more? Do I set up a new VBO for each entity that I want to draw? Or do I magically append to some static VBO that I setup early on?

- The code to be protected is contained (encrypted, no valid ELF) in the shared object. 
- The object itself is a valid ELF-file, containing an init method 
- The decryption should be started, dependend on a available license in the init function called by the loader. 
- After encryption the code is present as valid ELF-file in memory.

There were some further requirements:  

- The decrypted code must not be stored (even temporarily on disk) - prevent easy object dump and code reuse  
- The protection algorithm must not be published, so I may not use parts of the GNU code (even people do a great work there!)

I think the hard way is to reimplement a loader/linker providing the needed functionality... Perhaps there may be a way to use the Linux rtld, or parts of it, other linkers? 
Is there an easier way?  
Thanks for every idea/hint

- The code to be protected is contained (encrypted, no valid ELF) in the shared object. 
- The object itself is a valid ELF-file, containing an init method 
- The decryption should be started, dependend on a available license in the init function called by the loader. 
- After encryption the code is present as valid ELF-file in memory.

There were some further requirements:  

- The decrypted code must not be stored (even temporarily on disk) - prevent easy object dump and code reuse  
- The protection algorithm must not be published, so I may not use parts of the GNU code (even people do a great work there!)

I think the hard way is to reimplement a loader/linker providing the needed functionality... Perhaps there may be a way to use the Linux rtld, or parts of it, other linkers? 
Is there an easier way?  
Thanks for every idea/hint

I keep getting a segfault caused by a 64-bit pointer returned from a function being truncated to a 32-bit value and trying to access low memory.

Here's what I've figured out about it. VALUE is a long, defined in the ruby source code, and the code won't compile unless sizeof(long) is 8 bytes.

    rb_helper_function_foo(VALUE file)
    {
      VALUE blah;

      ...

      {
        ...

At the end of the function call, the return value has the correct address, but only the lower 4 bytes get returned: 0x009d52a0 instead of 0x1009d52a0. Accessing the low memory address is causing a segfault.

In the assembly code that gets called during the return, there's this instruction

    movslq %eax, %r12
which only copies the lower 4 bytes, but I need all 8 bytes of %rax to be copied.

`Option 2` only reads 1 byte at a time and if that single byte is a match, it reads the full 4-byte value from that address. This way, all bytes are read only once and only the 4 matching bytes are read twice.

  [1]: http://code.zhoubot.com/",c,compiler-errors,stack,pushdown-automaton,,,open,0,3345,9,"Error Compiling an Deterministic Pushdown Automaton in C (DPDA) I was reading about how to implement a DPDA and found this code in the following Internet address: [http://code.zhoubot.com/][1], This c file implements a simple pushdown automata. The automata will read in a description of their transition function and input, perform its computation on the input, and then print their output.

The input format is like:
e01:e0$:000111:a:ad:aeeb$:b0eb0:b10ce:c10ce:ce$de
The input is separated by a semicolon “:”, first section is “input alphabet”, second is “stack alphabet”, then “input” and the last whole bunch are transition functions.

I understand the error, but for the life of me I can't find the solution. Here's my code if it's needed.



    #include <stdio.h>
    
    long greatestPrime(long num)
    {
            int i;
    
            for(i = 2; i <= num; i++)
            {
                    if(num%i == 0)
                    {
                            num = num/i;
                            i--;
                    }
            }
    
            return num;
    }

    }

But I don't find the decoding method on the same site, and also its not working anyways. This is my corresponding objective-c code for it:

    NSString *txt = @""hello"";
    NSData *data = [txt dataUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];
    const char *nc = ggz_base16_encode(data.bytes, [data length]);
    NSString *str = [[NSString alloc] initWithCString:nc encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];
    }

Help would be much appreciated.

	 *
	 * Below is an excerpt from an email from Guy Harris on the tcpdump-workers
	 * mail list when someone asked, ""How do I get the length of the TCP
	 * payload?"" Guy Harris' slightly snipped response (edited by him to
	 * speak of the IPv4 header length and TCP data offset without referring
	 * to bitfield structure members) is reproduced below:
	 * 
	 * The Ethernet size is always 14 bytes.
	 * 
	 * <snip>...</snip>
	 *
	 * In fact, you *MUST* assume the Ethernet header is 14 bytes, *and*, if 
	 * you're using structures, you must use structures where the members 
	 * always have the same size on all platforms, because the sizes of the 
	 * fields in Ethernet - and IP, and TCP, and... - headers are defined by 
	 * the protocol specification, not by the way a particular platform's C 
	 * compiler works.)
	 *
	 * The IP header size, in bytes, is the value of the IP header length,
	 * as extracted from the ""ip_vhl"" field of ""struct sniff_ip"" with
	 * the ""IP_HL()"" macro, times 4 (""times 4"" because it's in units of
	 * 4-byte words).  If that value is less than 20 - i.e., if the value
	 * extracted with ""IP_HL()"" is less than 5 - you have a malformed
	 * IP datagram.
	 *
	 * The TCP header size, in bytes, is the value of the TCP data offset,
	 * as extracted from the ""th_offx2"" field of ""struct sniff_tcp"" with
	 * the ""TH_OFF()"" macro, times 4 (for the same reason - 4-byte words).
	 * If that value is less than 20 - i.e., if the value extracted with
	 * ""TH_OFF()"" is less than 5 - you have a malformed TCP segment.
	 *
	 * So, to find the IP header in an Ethernet packet, look 14 bytes after 
	 * the beginning of the packet data.  To find the TCP header, look 
	 * ""IP_HL(ip)*4"" bytes after the beginning of the IP header.  To find the
	 * TCP payload, look ""TH_OFF(tcp)*4"" bytes after the beginning of the TCP
	 * header.
	 * 
	 * To find out how much payload there is:
	 *
	 * Take the IP *total* length field - ""ip_len"" in ""struct sniff_ip"" 
	 * - and, first, check whether it's less than ""IP_HL(ip)*4"" (after
	 * you've checked whether ""IP_HL(ip)"" is >= 5).  If it is, you have
	 * a malformed IP datagram.
	 *
	 * Otherwise, subtract ""IP_HL(ip)*4"" from it; that gives you the length
	 * of the TCP segment, including the TCP header.  If that's less than
	 * ""TH_OFF(tcp)*4"" (after you've checked whether ""TH_OFF(tcp)"" is >= 5),
	 * you have a malformed TCP segment.
	 *
	 * Otherwise, subtract ""TH_OFF(tcp)*4"" from it; that gives you the
	 * length of the TCP payload.
	 *
	 * Note that you also need to make sure that you don't go past the end 
	 * of the captured data in the packet - you might, for example, have a 
	 * 15-byte Ethernet packet that claims to contain an IP datagram, but if 
	 * it's 15 bytes, it has only one byte of Ethernet payload, which is too 
	 * small for an IP header.  The length of the captured data is given in 
	 * the ""caplen"" field in the ""struct pcap_pkthdr""; it might be less than 
	 * the length of the packet, if you're capturing with a snapshot length 
	 * other than a value >= the maximum packet size.
	 * <end of response>

	 *
	 * Code Comments
	 *
	 * This section contains additional information and explanations regarding
	 * comments in the source code. It serves as documentaion and rationale
	 * for why the code is written as it is without hindering readability, as it
	 * might if it were placed along with the actual code inline. References in
	 * the code appear as footnote notation (e.g. [1]).
	 *
	 * 1. Ethernet headers are always exactly 14 bytes, so we define this
	 * explicitly with ""#define"". Since some compilers might pad structures to a
	 * multiple of 4 bytes - some versions of GCC for ARM may do this -
	 * ""sizeof (struct sniff_ethernet)"" isn't used.
	 * 
	 * 2. Check the link-layer type of the device that's being opened to make
	 * sure it's Ethernet, since that's all we handle in this example. Other
	 * link-layer types may have different length headers (see [1]).
	 *
	 * 3. This is the filter expression that tells libpcap which packets we're
	 * interested in (i.e. which packets to capture). Since this source example
	 * focuses on IP and TCP, we use the expression ""ip"", so we know we'll only
	 * encounter IP packets. The capture filter syntax, along with some
	 * examples, is documented in the tcpdump man page under ""expression.""
	 * Below are a few simple examples:
	 *
	 * Expression			Description
	 * ----------			-----------
	 * ip					Capture all IP packets.
	 * tcp					Capture only TCP packets.
	 * tcp port 80			Capture only TCP packets with a port equal to 80.
	 * ip host 10.1.2.3		Capture all IP packets to or from host 10.1.2.3.

	 *
	 * Below is an excerpt from an email from Guy Harris on the tcpdump-workers
	 * mail list when someone asked, ""How do I get the length of the TCP
	 * payload?"" Guy Harris' slightly snipped response (edited by him to
	 * speak of the IPv4 header length and TCP data offset without referring
	 * to bitfield structure members) is reproduced below:
	 * 
	 * The Ethernet size is always 14 bytes.
	 * 
	 * <snip>...</snip>
	 *
	 * In fact, you *MUST* assume the Ethernet header is 14 bytes, *and*, if 
	 * you're using structures, you must use structures where the members 
	 * always have the same size on all platforms, because the sizes of the 
	 * fields in Ethernet - and IP, and TCP, and... - headers are defined by 
	 * the protocol specification, not by the way a particular platform's C 
	 * compiler works.)
	 *
	 * The IP header size, in bytes, is the value of the IP header length,
	 * as extracted from the ""ip_vhl"" field of ""struct sniff_ip"" with
	 * the ""IP_HL()"" macro, times 4 (""times 4"" because it's in units of
	 * 4-byte words).  If that value is less than 20 - i.e., if the value
	 * extracted with ""IP_HL()"" is less than 5 - you have a malformed
	 * IP datagram.
	 *
	 * The TCP header size, in bytes, is the value of the TCP data offset,
	 * as extracted from the ""th_offx2"" field of ""struct sniff_tcp"" with
	 * the ""TH_OFF()"" macro, times 4 (for the same reason - 4-byte words).
	 * If that value is less than 20 - i.e., if the value extracted with
	 * ""TH_OFF()"" is less than 5 - you have a malformed TCP segment.
	 *
	 * So, to find the IP header in an Ethernet packet, look 14 bytes after 
	 * the beginning of the packet data.  To find the TCP header, look 
	 * ""IP_HL(ip)*4"" bytes after the beginning of the IP header.  To find the
	 * TCP payload, look ""TH_OFF(tcp)*4"" bytes after the beginning of the TCP
	 * header.
	 * 
	 * To find out how much payload there is:
	 *
	 * Take the IP *total* length field - ""ip_len"" in ""struct sniff_ip"" 
	 * - and, first, check whether it's less than ""IP_HL(ip)*4"" (after
	 * you've checked whether ""IP_HL(ip)"" is >= 5).  If it is, you have
	 * a malformed IP datagram.
	 *
	 * Otherwise, subtract ""IP_HL(ip)*4"" from it; that gives you the length
	 * of the TCP segment, including the TCP header.  If that's less than
	 * ""TH_OFF(tcp)*4"" (after you've checked whether ""TH_OFF(tcp)"" is >= 5),
	 * you have a malformed TCP segment.
	 *
	 * Otherwise, subtract ""TH_OFF(tcp)*4"" from it; that gives you the
	 * length of the TCP payload.
	 *
	 * Note that you also need to make sure that you don't go past the end 
	 * of the captured data in the packet - you might, for example, have a 
	 * 15-byte Ethernet packet that claims to contain an IP datagram, but if 
	 * it's 15 bytes, it has only one byte of Ethernet payload, which is too 
	 * small for an IP header.  The length of the captured data is given in 
	 * the ""caplen"" field in the ""struct pcap_pkthdr""; it might be less than 
	 * the length of the packet, if you're capturing with a snapshot length 
	 * other than a value >= the maximum packet size.
	 * <end of response>

	 *
	 * Code Comments
	 *
	 * This section contains additional information and explanations regarding
	 * comments in the source code. It serves as documentaion and rationale
	 * for why the code is written as it is without hindering readability, as it
	 * might if it were placed along with the actual code inline. References in
	 * the code appear as footnote notation (e.g. [1]).
	 *
	 * 1. Ethernet headers are always exactly 14 bytes, so we define this
	 * explicitly with ""#define"". Since some compilers might pad structures to a
	 * multiple of 4 bytes - some versions of GCC for ARM may do this -
	 * ""sizeof (struct sniff_ethernet)"" isn't used.
	 * 
	 * 2. Check the link-layer type of the device that's being opened to make
	 * sure it's Ethernet, since that's all we handle in this example. Other
	 * link-layer types may have different length headers (see [1]).
	 *
	 * 3. This is the filter expression that tells libpcap which packets we're
	 * interested in (i.e. which packets to capture). Since this source example
	 * focuses on IP and TCP, we use the expression ""ip"", so we know we'll only
	 * encounter IP packets. The capture filter syntax, along with some
	 * examples, is documented in the tcpdump man page under ""expression.""
	 * Below are a few simple examples:
	 *
	 * Expression			Description
	 * ----------			-----------
	 * ip					Capture all IP packets.
	 * tcp					Capture only TCP packets.
	 * tcp port 80			Capture only TCP packets with a port equal to 80.
	 * ip host 10.1.2.3		Capture all IP packets to or from host 10.1.2.3.

<pre>
/* Force a compilation error if condition is true */
#define BUILD_BUG_ON(condition) ((void)sizeof(char[1 - 2*!!(condition)]))

So, in your code, if you have some structure which must be, say a multiple of 8 bytes in size, maybe because of some hardware constraints, you can do:
<pre>
BUILD_BUG_ON((sizeof(struct mystruct) % 8) != 0);
</pre>
and it won't compile unless the size of struct mystruct is a multiple of 8, and if it is a multiple of 8, no runtime code is generated at all.

Another trick I know is from the book ""Graphics Gems"" which allows a single header file to both declare and initialize variables in one module while in other modules using that module, merely declare them as externs.

<pre>
#ifdef DEFINE_MYHEADER_GLOBALS
#define GLOBAL
#define INIT(x, y) (x) = (y)
#else
#define GLOBAL extern
#define INIT(x, y)
#endif

GLOBAL int INIT(x, 0);
GLOBAL int somefunc(int a, int b);

The book says that since `-` and `/` are not commutative operators, the order in which the 2 `pop` functions are evaluated is necessary (obviously, to get the correct result)...and thus you have to put the result of the first function in a variable first and then proceed with the arithmetic, like such:

    op2 = pop();
    push(op2 - pop());

Apparently this is because the compiler can't guarantee in which order the functions are evaluated (...why?)

    static int A[3][2] = { { 1, 2 }, { 3, 4 }, { 5, 6 } };

That's fine and I can access all the members of it. However I have several problems passing it to a function, e.g.:

    void print_matrix(int **a, int r, int c)
    {
        int x, y;
    
        for(x = 0; x < r; x++)
        {
            printf(""Row %02d = %#x = "", x, a[x]);
    
            for(y = 0; y < c; y++)
            {
                printf(""%s%d"", (0 == y) ? """" : "", "", a[x][y]);
            }
            printf(""\n"");
        }
    }

Firstly I can't simply pass `A` to the function, I need to cast it to (int **). Since `char *` is synonymous to `char []`, I was a little surprised at this. Secondly, it crashes and when I check in the debugger, within the sub-function, `a[0]` is reported as `1` and not a pointer to an array of integers.

I know there is compiler/C language arcane magic happening here. But it is all a little confusing. If I try to initialise as:

    static int *A[3] = { { 1, 2 }, { 3, 4 }, { 5, 6 } };

I get a ton of warnings. How does this differ to:

    static char *S[3] = { ""hello"". ""there"", ""stackoverflow"" };


-----

Apart from the question of arcane C magic, which somehow I have never learnt despite over a decade of C programming :(, I would like to know how to generate my array so I can successfully pass it as an `int **` without having to go through all the fag of for loops or copying the statically allocated array to a dynamically allocated one.

Would the following work?

    int *A0 = { 1, 2 };
    int *A1 = { 3, 4 };
    int *A2 = { 5, 6 };
    int **A = { A0, A1, A2 };

Is there a nicer way than this of doing it?


Thanks, all.

P.s. I know that in real life we would read values from a DB or file into dynamically allocated arrays and avoid all this stuff.

Some of the code (int sign = fp & 0x8000) and (int shift = (fp>>11) & 0xF) do not make any sense to me. Could you tell me what some of these lines do? Thank you.

The following code implements a simple floating point number/integer system, allowing for extended-range integers nonetheless stored in a short (two machine bytes format.

Your job is to modify the code so that it supports both a hidden bit (implicit given a non-zero exponent) and gradual underflow (when the exponent is zero). The remaining questions all suppose that you have completed the code upgrade.

what are the smallest two positive values you can present?
what are the maximum in magnitude (positive and negative) you can represent?
what does the machine word 0xFFFE represent under FP?
what does the machine word 0x0002 represent under FP?
express the FP product of 0xF11F (x) 0x1FF1 in mini-FP format.
express the FP product of 0x1234 (x) 0x4321 as an (inf. precision) integer
reproduce your program code and machine runs in what you email. A working body of code
appears below, which must be extended slightly to support what is required above.

",c,,,,,11/10/2011 20:53:50,too localized,1,1205,5,"Trouble understanding this C code at our university, we never learned C but in this class, we are required to use it without any prior knowledge of this language. Some of the code (int sign = fp & 0x8000) and (int shift = (fp>>11) & 0xF) do not make any sense to me. Could you tell me what some of these lines do? Thank you.

The following code implements a simple floating point number/integer system, allowing for extended-range integers nonetheless stored in a short (two machine bytes format.

Your job is to modify the code so that it supports both a hidden bit (implicit given a non-zero exponent) and gradual underflow (when the exponent is zero). The remaining questions all suppose that you have completed the code upgrade.

what are the smallest two positive values you can present?
what are the maximum in magnitude (positive and negative) you can represent?
what does the machine word 0xFFFE represent under FP?
what does the machine word 0x0002 represent under FP?
express the FP product of 0xF11F (x) 0x1FF1 in mini-FP format.
express the FP product of 0x1234 (x) 0x4321 as an (inf. precision) integer
reproduce your program code and machine runs in what you email. A working body of code
appears below, which must be extended slightly to support what is required above.

Thanks for your time.",c,,,,,05/25/2011 17:52:02,not a real question,1,572,4,"C error, need help I have this final work project that I've been doing the past days, and i am freaking out because the deadline is here and i cant find what is wrong with my code, everything i do gives me ""Segmentation Fault<Core dumped> "" error, however when i compile it doesn't give me any error.

9425740,02/24/2012 05:13:50,1089679,12/09/2011 12:08:53,311,2,Guide me in this Confusion ( file Verification with CRC16 in C),"here i have confusion in output of CRC16.

Here first i used only one function which using `char readChar` and counts CRC16 of any type of file but in `.tar or .tar.gz` files i got some problem regarding `EOF` and in my previous question some one suggested me use `int` instead of `char` in `declartion of readChar`.

So After this i got solution of `EOF` in while loop and its read proper bytes.

Than After here i put two methods for calculating CRC16.
In first one i used `int readChar` and in second one i used `char readChar.`
So i got different out for same file this problem i am getting in `.tar and .tar.gz` files only. In simple `.txt` files this both methods gives same result.

Here i put my both program's code and output

**int datatype program**

Here in both case same number of bytes read and same number of loop repeated. only change is char and int datatype of readChar.

So whats problem in this datatype. its not do problem in simple any large txt file.

So can any one tell me the proper solution of this which is correct method for calculating CRC16 for any type of file.

",c,embedded,crc,,,,open,0,1363,12,"Guide me in this Confusion ( file Verification with CRC16 in C) here i have confusion in output of CRC16.

Here first i used only one function which using `char readChar` and counts CRC16 of any type of file but in `.tar or .tar.gz` files i got some problem regarding `EOF` and in my previous question some one suggested me use `int` instead of `char` in `declartion of readChar`.

So After this i got solution of `EOF` in while loop and its read proper bytes.

Than After here i put two methods for calculating CRC16.
In first one i used `int readChar` and in second one i used `char readChar.`
So i got different out for same file this problem i am getting in `.tar and .tar.gz` files only. In simple `.txt` files this both methods gives same result.

This is the code that I have to figure out the missing side of a right triangle. The input for the side that you do not know is 0. When I run the program it asks me for all the sides but then it does not go on and give me the answer...Could anyone please explain this?
Thanks

`((X+3)*(X+4))` into a Binary Tree, along with some other features. So far, i have taken in the input, and parsed it into two stacks, one containing the operands, the other the operators. 

I defined the stacks simply for now (so they only have a nextnode and `char value`.
However, i seem to have problems adding values from the stacks into my tree (so probably a problem in defining the tree). 

My stack is defined as such:

    typedef struct node
    {
        char value;
        struct node * nextnode;
    } node;

My tree is defined:

    typedef struct tree
    {
        node * thisNode;
        struct tree *right, *left;
    } tree;

I'm not sure about the node* part, perhaps it should be something different.

I've been considering the simple case of 2+3 for starters. In this case, the root of the tree should be +, with left being 2 and right being 3. 

     +
    /\
    2 3

my question is how to add something thats on a stack to my tree?
I have tried using

    root->thisNode = operatorTop;

where operatorTop is the top of the operator stack (defined as `node * operatorTop`)
but even that simple line seems to segfault.
