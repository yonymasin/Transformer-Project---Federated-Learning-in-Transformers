The parameter works nicely

I would like to modify my page aspx so it takes the parameter itself.
Today I'm calling the page 

    Config.aspx 

and I would like to do something like this call it  

    Config.aspx?ConfiguredCarId=11

 
How do I modify the above code to reflect the change?
Thanks

The parameter works nicely

I would like to modify my page aspx so it takes the parameter itself.
Today I'm calling the page 

    Config.aspx 

and I would like to do something like this call it  

    Config.aspx?ConfiguredCarId=11

 
How do I modify the above code to reflect the change?
Thanks

However, I cannot get background-repeat working in Outlook 2007. I have also tried setting its height to 100% with mixed results.

I'm actually using the background attribute in a td at the moment as the background styling did not work at all for popular clients (gmail, thunderbird). Can anyone think of a workaround I could use?

If not, is there a way to detect if an email is being displayed in Outlook 2007 so that I could look into removing shadow images for the entire email?

 ",html,css,layout,posterous,,,open,0,3483,3,"div height 100% I know this has been asked a million times, but I haven't had much luck making it work.I'm working on a Posterous layout, and I'm trying to get my may content to flow to the bottom.

Here is a link to the [layout so far][1]

You can see that the content is held within center_col, so I basically need this column to stretch to the bottom of the page/window regardless of how much content is in there.

I was coding a website designed by another guy into a html/css template.
The background is a big image, and the top banner has some elements that overflow to the background - following his project directive - he didn't want any floating div, etc. I did cutting the image and letting part of it on the background, and with a centralized content, I could put the images back together.

But no matter what I did, there was always 1 pixel separating the banner from the rest of the image on the background. I call the guy after my 2 or 3 hours frustration trying to ""fix"" my css, html, whatever - but he said this always happened - that I just should move that bit of the image (the background) 1 pixel to the left, before flattening the image and save it as the site background.


I hope this make sense, I can't put an example here because of my contract - but will try to reproduce with another image if my explanation is not good enough.

What I wan't to know is, why this happens?

I was using on the background image position: center and top.
The website main div container is centralized, the logical thing is: the banner and the rest of the overflow element should meet. 

And I have checked, I did not cut one pixel extra.



",html,css,layout,website,background,05/31/2011 21:43:00,not a real question,1,243,8,"1 pixel to the right on pages background I just came across a problem that annoyed me for a couple of hours, before I decided for a hack.

I was coding a website designed by another guy into a html/css template.
The background is a big image, and the top banner has some elements that overflow to the background - following his project directive - he didn't want any floating div, etc. I did cutting the image and letting part of it on the background, and with a centralized content, I could put the images back together.

But no matter what I did, there was always 1 pixel separating the banner from the rest of the image on the background. I call the guy after my 2 or 3 hours frustration trying to ""fix"" my css, html, whatever - but he said this always happened - that I just should move that bit of the image (the background) 1 pixel to the left, before flattening the image and save it as the site background.


I hope this make sense, I can't put an example here because of my contract - but will try to reproduce with another image if my explanation is not good enough.

What I wan't to know is, why this happens?

I was using on the background image position: center and top.
The website main div container is centralized, the logical thing is: the banner and the rest of the overflow element should meet. 

And I have checked, I did not cut one pixel extra.

It's like the html tag was with padding-bottom:1px and wrapped in another element with white background (but it's not, and it has no padding). It looks like the differences between IE9 standards and quirks mode shows when determining a wrapping element's width, but vertically. It also feels like the content of an element gets pushed 1px by a previous element, like their content, but, not margins or borders, were overlapping the next element dimensions.

I can't determine exactly what causes it. Sometimes, a page contains 2 tables and everything is fine. Then you need to add a third one, and then the line shows up. Doesn't even need to be tables btw.

Sometimes, reseting css solves it. Setting same line-height i have on body to links:

    body {
        line-height: 1
    }
    a, links, visited {
        line-height: 1
    }

fixes it, but not always. Only thing i can do, is check element by element and disabling/enabling its css rules till it's gone.

I noticed that when there is elements like tables, inputs, textareas, this issue is more likely to happen. 'resetting' it's attributes sometimes solves it too.

I know it would be easier to provide a code as an example, but like i said, i coudn't determine a pattern for it. I can give you some examples of sites/urls i notice that error (you gotta look at the very bottom of the page and see the difference between IE and another browser, like Firefox):

You have to check these pages/urls with IE9 and let their doctypes set to IE9 patterns. If you force it to use quirks mode, the lines wont be shown.

the presence of this issue on very stablished or not sites makes me feel it's a IE9 bug and the only definitive fix for it is always use white background, so nobody will notice the white line (the line will still be there though). but thats obviously not the best option.

Basically, I have no idea how to put the two together to work as a whole.

I'd really appreciate some advice or example on this matter since I found nothing useful when using compojure and hiccup except for creating new html pages from scratch.",3

3. The server inputs the username and password automatically, and then gets redirected to a ""user section"" of the site.
4. The server clicks on one of the links on the sidebar, and gets sent to another page ""user section"".
5. Then, the site grabs all of the content on this page, and displays it on example.com

I have not seen a RSS creating website that enables you to do this, which is why I am trying to accomplish it this way.  However, if anyone knows of a RSS website that will enable you to do this, that would also be great.

Now you want the text to display under the image, rather than to the right of it.  Let's say for some strange reason you can't change the HTML, only the CSS file.  One thing you can do is add the ""display: block"" style to the `<img>` tag, however if you do that, the image will no longer be centered in the div which you need.

If I could modify the HTML, I could just put a `<br />` right after the image (though some say a velociraptor will eat you if you use too many br tags).

Any ideas?

The header and the left column have the property position: fixed. The right-hand column is basically the only thing that moves.  The header has the width of the page. All elements have a transparent background, sitting above a [supersized](http://www.buildinternet.com/project/supersized/) background image. This works great and looks good apart from one problem.

When the right column scrolls up, it comes under the header's contents, which looks awful. Ideally, the right-hand column would get cut off by the header. But there's to be no background on the header. I could make a wrapper for the right-hand column and fix it in position, and use overflow-auto to scroll within that, but I need the page itself to be scrollable. Lastly, I can't just cut out a bit of the background image and give it to the header, because the background moves behind the elements independently.

This is what I'm using for the right-hand column at the moment:

	margin-top: 250px;
	margin-left: 380px;
	float: left;
	width: 560px;

I'm open to any suggestions that don't violate those principles. I'm not afraid of using jQuery or another JS solution. This Is Impossible is also an answer, but I'd rather it not be.

Thanks guys!

While I can easily change the default action with javascript and style the default button using css, I'm having trouble making IE stop highlighting the first button.

Is there any way to tell IE what button is the default?  Is there any way to tell other browsers what is the default without using javascript to capture the enter event?",3

The pages' meta tags specify UTF-8 encoding. However, a number of pages contain characters that can't be interpreted by UTF-8, probably because the files were saved with another encoding (such as ANSI). The one in particular I'm concerned about right now is a fancy apostrophe (as in ""**Bob’s**""...sorry if that doesn't show up correctly). W3's validator indicates the entity is ""**\x92**"", but it won't validate the file because it doesn't map to unicode. And, of course, if I open the file in Notepad++ and change the encoding to UTF-8, the character is replaced by a 92 in a black box.

Here's my question: what's the easiest way to fix this? Do I have to open all the pages and replace that character with a conventional apostrophe? Or is there a quick fix I could add (say, to IIS) that might override or fix the encoding issue? Or do I have to brute-force find/replace?

Once you run the page, and view the source, you'll see the tags for the dynamically generated table. Now select another option from the DropDownLists to regenerate a different table, then view the source again, you will find the old table tags still there, and no sign of the new table (though it's showing on the screen).

The only way I found for it to work correctly is to force a full PostBack. Is there any other way ? the reason why I need it cause some javascripts will be running.

Hope my example is clear. Any hints will be really appreciated.

Once you run the page, and view the source, you'll see the tags for the dynamically generated table. Now select another option from the DropDownLists to regenerate a different table, then view the source again, you will find the old table tags still there, and no sign of the new table (though it's showing on the screen).

The only way I found for it to work correctly is to force a full PostBack. Is there any other way ? the reason why I need it cause some javascripts will be running.

Hope my example is clear. Any hints will be really appreciated.

But I have a huge problem.

So I will create a webpage that has a sidebar, and the sidebar will have links to other pages and stuff. The way I am coding, for each link on the sidebar, I have another HTML document. The sidebar links just link to another .html file, which contains the website template/layout whatever you want to call it. So I have an index.html that is the home page, then an about.html, etc. And for each of the html documents, the file contains the code for the layout of the entire website (the sidebar, footer, etc). So between the different links that the sidebar links to, the only difference is the content. So if I want to change the layout of my webpage (the color of the sidebar, for example) I will have to go to each html document and change it. 

So my question is how are people supposed to go about doing this? I don't think I am doing it correctly. Are you just supposed to have one file that contains the template?

   **&lt;TR>&lt;TD>** *col1* **&lt;TD>** *col2* **&lt;TD>** *col3* **&lt;/TR>**

**Note:** The output is `HTML`, complete with optional closing tags omitted. This is **the** problem, and the reason the question exists.

A snippet of the XSL i'm using is:

    <?xml version='1.0'?>
    <xsl:stylesheet version=""1.0"" xmlns:xsl=""http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"">
        <xsl:output 
    	doctype-system='http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd'
    	doctype-public='-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN'
    	indent='yes'
    	method='html'
    	/>
       ...
       <xsl:for-each select=""/"">  
          <TR><TD><xsl:value-of select=""col1""/><TD><xsl:value-of select=""col2""/><TD><xsl:value-of select=""col3""/></TR>
       </xsl:for-each>

You can see that the guts of the XSL matches my desired HTML (wrapped for easy reading):

    <TR>  <TD><xsl:value-of select=""Column1""/>
          <TD><xsl:value-of select=""Column2""/>
          <TD><xsl:value-of select=""Column3""/> </TR>

**Note:** Those of you who know the error i'm getting from the XSLT: hopefully already know the answer.

When presented with my `XSL` (which, don't forget,  is a form of `xml`), i get the non-well formed error:

> End tag 'TR' does not match the start tag 'TD'.

This makes perfect sense. Indeed:

    <TD><xsl:value-of select=""Column3""/> </TR>

i do not close the `TD` element before closing the `TR`. So the question is:

How can i transform `xml` into `HTML`, given that `HTML` is not `xml`?

The images are coming from a service at a standard size, so have no choice but to resize them in HTML. Another restriction is, the codeblock has to be self-contained (like an embed code) and not reliant on any external stylesheets. I'm overlaying a play button as a transparent PNG.

Since the whole box has <code>text-align: center;</code> applied to it, you would think that the two form fields would line up exactly, right (one on top of the other with both edges aligned perfectly, since they're the same width)? However, in Firefox, the second form field is shifted over to the right by maybe 1 or 2 pixels.

What causes this? Does the line break itself take up a very small amount of space and therefore throw off the centering? If so, how do I prevent it?",5

My problem is that the former operation (tagging data) is ""obviously"" a POST operation, whereas the latter operation (viewing data according to a tag) is ""obviously"" a GET operation. But the method attribute is attached to the form, not the submit button, so I have to choose one or other for both buttons.

I don't want to make two forms, since as far as I can tell this would force me to duplicate the entire tag list. Is there any way I can choose my method based on the choice of submit button?

A JavaScript solution is permissible, but one without would be preferred.

Thanks,",html,css,sharepoint,,,,open,0,253,7,"Trouble with CSS sprites in sharepoint 2007 I am trying to reduce the overall number of images on my site so I have implemented a css sprite menu.  This code works fine in Internet Explorer 8 on my desktop, and when I implemented the code to sharepoint 2007 it works fine when using FireFox, but not for ie8 for some reason.  Is there any known fixes or bugs with css in sharepoint 2007 when using ie8? I just find it odd that it only wont work with MOSS2007 and ie8 combined.

 - I cannot control the nesting of the divs above, because of dynamically inserting components in the web page. There can be various nesting scenarios that I must handle. 

 - I must not change the css structure and the way it is applied - like `canvas` and `red`/`blue` etc being separate class names, instead of having `canvas_red` and `canvas_blue` as different classes.

----------
I do not plan to support IE6, therefore I can use the `>` token in my css. However, I was unable to properly take advantage of it. I'd apreciate if you change my code using it more appropriately.

This message box has to appear at the top right corner of the page overlapping the existing contents.

I've tried to use `position: absolute` but then I'm unable to place it in the right corner. Also I'm unable to use `left` since I've to support responsive design from Bootstrap.

Here is a sample markup

    <html>
        <body>
            <div class=""container"">
                <!-- Need to place this div at the top right of the page-->
                <div class=""ajax-message"">
                    <div class=""row"">
                        <div class=""span9"">
                            <div class=""alert"">
                                <a class=""close icon icon-remove""></a>
                                <div class=""message-content"">
                                    Some message goes here
                                </div>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <!-- Page contents starts here. These are dynamic-->
                <div class=""row"">
                    <div class=""span12 inner-col"">
                        <h2>Documents</h2>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
        </body>
    </html>

This message box should have a width of `50%` with respect to the `.container` and the left side of the message box should not be overlapped by it. ie we should be able to click/select the contents of the left side.

  [1]: http://jsfiddle.net/arunpjohny/f9hKE/",html,css,,,,,open,0,640,11,"How to place a div on right side with absolute psoition I've a page where a dynamic message box has to be displayed without disturbing the actual page. This message box has to appear at the top right corner of the page overlapping the existing contents.

I've tried to use `position: absolute` but then I'm unable to place it in the right corner. Also I'm unable to use `left` since I've to support responsive design from Bootstrap.

Here is a sample markup

    <html>
        <body>
            <div class=""container"">
                <!-- Need to place this div at the top right of the page-->
                <div class=""ajax-message"">
                    <div class=""row"">
                        <div class=""span9"">
                            <div class=""alert"">
                                <a class=""close icon icon-remove""></a>
                                <div class=""message-content"">
                                    Some message goes here
                                </div>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <!-- Page contents starts here. These are dynamic-->
                <div class=""row"">
                    <div class=""span12 inner-col"">
                        <h2>Documents</h2>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
        </body>
    </html>

This message box should have a width of `50%` with respect to the `.container` and the left side of the message box should not be overlapped by it. ie we should be able to click/select the contents of the left side.

I want good performance but can't figure out whether using sass or less would significantly help with this.

The reason why, is firstly I see how using variables and mixins allows you to keep certain things in one place but once the css is compiled you could end up with, for example, lots of styles with the same border radius prefix settings and this could lead to a large css file or a larger one than you might have had you followed a more traditional approach... So even though the less file keeps certain code to a minimum, once it's compiled the file has the potential to be quite large like in the below example. Is this right?

    input, textarea {
    	border-radius: 2px;
    	-moz-border-radius: 2px;
    	-webkit-border-radius: 2px;
    }
    
    .box1, .box2 {
    	border-radius: 2px;
    	-moz-border-radius: 2px;
    	-webkit-border-radius: 2px;
    }
    
    .btn, button, .btn a {
    	border-radius: 2px;
    	-moz-border-radius: 2px;
    	-webkit-border-radius: 2px;
    }

Another approach would be to create a class for border radius with each of the browser prefixes and add this to each html tag where you'd want this. And you'd do the same for with other styles so each html tag uses multiple classes. The downside to this would mean going back and fourth between the css and the html every now and then and the upside is the size of the css may be reduced considerably.

    .radius2 {
    	border-radius: 2px;
    	-moz-border-radius: 2px;
    	-webkit-border-radius: 2px;
    }

And then another approach would be to create one style for radius with all the browser prefixes and add all the classes and ids, etc of the elements you want to it like so:

    input, textarea, .box1, .box2, .btn, button, .btn a {
    	border-radius: 2px;
    	-moz-border-radius: 2px;
    	-webkit-border-radius: 2px;
    }


**So to summarise, I'm wondering what's the best approach or if there's maybe a better way to do things. I'm also wondering if I'm missing something with sass and less. They seem like great tools but I'm not quite sure if there's a signigicant reason why I should use either on any project.
And finally, what's a large stylesheet nowadays. I've been trying my best to get all my stylesheets down below 15kb or 20kb but find it hard. Then I see that twitters bootstrap css is 56kb (47kb minified)! What's a good size and what are the impacts on things like pagerank, seo etc if you have a ""large"" stylesheet?**",html,css,seo,sass,less,11/30/2011 07:50:13,off topic,1,489,14,"Less and Sass vs traditional css methods and thoughts on performance and seo etc I've been trying to create a decent workflow for building sites using html and css.

    	-webkit-border-radius: 2px;
    }
    
    .btn, button, .btn a {
    	border-radius: 2px;
    	-moz-border-radius: 2px;
    	-webkit-border-radius: 2px;
    }

Another approach would be to create a class for border radius with each of the browser prefixes and add this to each html tag where you'd want this. And you'd do the same for with other styles so each html tag uses multiple classes. The downside to this would mean going back and fourth between the css and the html every now and then and the upside is the size of the css may be reduced considerably.

    .radius2 {
    	border-radius: 2px;
    	-moz-border-radius: 2px;
    	-webkit-border-radius: 2px;
    }

And then another approach would be to create one style for radius with all the browser prefixes and add all the classes and ids, etc of the elements you want to it like so:

    input, textarea, .box1, .box2, .btn, button, .btn a {
    	border-radius: 2px;
    	-moz-border-radius: 2px;
    	-webkit-border-radius: 2px;
    }


**So to summarise, I'm wondering what's the best approach or if there's maybe a better way to do things. I'm also wondering if I'm missing something with sass and less. They seem like great tools but I'm not quite sure if there's a signigicant reason why I should use either on any project.
And finally, what's a large stylesheet nowadays. I've been trying my best to get all my stylesheets down below 15kb or 20kb but find it hard. Then I see that twitters bootstrap css is 56kb (47kb minified)! What's a good size and what are the impacts on things like pagerank, seo etc if you have a ""large"" stylesheet?**",5

    .resume-section > .left-col < .right-col > ul { margin-bottom:200px; }
              
and 
   

    .resume-section > .left-col , .right-col > ul { margin-bottom:200px; }

and nothing happened.

 I've constructed a set of code, but sadly unable to test them out just yet due to some technical constraint. Will only be able to access it next week. However, I thought it will be a good time to ask here and let the advance user view my draft code and see if its feasible.

The CSS specification recommends a ""reference pixel"" of roughly 90ppi. So far so good. But every screen has different ppi values. Some going down to 72 other go far higher then the 90.

This fact shows me that using pixels is not very accurate and I'm thinking about switching over to Absolute Units. It sounds silly, but I want to know if a mm for example has exactly the same size on every screen, or are there also differences from screen to screen, how big a mm is?

I can't give you an online link right now as this is all still happening on localhost.

So with the smooshed output code I can of course create the html site, because as I said before, the rendering still works fine. But to really be able to work with it, that's just plain impossible. At first I thought it might be an editor error. I usually work with Dreamweaver, so I tried editing and saving the .php in UltraEdit and in Notepad++, both yielding the same result though.

So I ask you, fair designers of the underground woods: how do I solve this mess?

Many thanks in advance.",5

The tutorials have gone fine, however I would like to make my navigation bar a fluid so that it adjusts to different browser sizes while still remaining a horizontal navigation bar. 

I have heard that this fluid CSS could be achieved using % and ems instead of fixed width of pixels, however my attempts to achieve this have failed. Please may anyone provide some help as to how I may achieve this fluid CSS.

Here is a jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/cambraca/f9eYx/3/

You noticed that the logon div is located inside of the content page. This is because I need the logon to be exactly on top of the content area. You noticed also that the sidebar can disappear with the Hide me hyperlink.

I don't like the logon inside of the content area. Is there any other solution? Possible to have the logon div at the same level as other div? I'm not very good at css and I'm pretty sure there is a better alternative for the logon placement.

To simplify things I just specify a single font size for the entire body text:

     ...

Yet, while locally (on my PC) the font looks as I want it to look like:

> Firefox 3.6:

> ![enter image description here][1]
> 
> Internet Explorer 8:
>

> 
> ![enter image description here][3]
> 
> Internet Explorer 8 on eBay:
> 
> ![enter image description here][4]

I tried of course different font-size unit specification (`em`, `%`, etc.) but the discrepancy remains.

Why is this happening and how can I get around this (without resorting to posting an image of the text...).

I understand that there might be some collision between eBay's CSS and my HTML (I don't use any CSS, I only use inline style!), but I don't know how to tell eBay **not** to override my style.

Any idea how to overcome this?

Inside this div I left-float a series of content DIVs. These are either 200px or 400px wide, all have the same height.

Three 200px-wide DIVs would align perfectly one one line, a single 400px one followed by a 200px one also, etc.

Obviously if I had two 200px ones, followed by a 400px one, the latter would drop down to the row below, leaving a 200px-wide space at the end of the row above.

Now, assuming the content in these DIVs is text, would there be a way to detect a DIV will be dropping to the next row because of its width + lack of remaining space on the current row; then divide this 400px div into two 200px ones, splitting the content across them, leaving the first part as the last 200px wide DIV of line 1 and the rest in the first 200px DIV of line 2?

Jquery will be used on the site so if a solution using jquery could be found it would make things easier. I tried to play with the columnize plugin but found no way of doing this. I'm pretty much a JS beginner though.

Any help/pointers appreciated.

which as you can see, start_html has no action parameter assigned in the form definition. But with this code, I get the following html output for that form definition:

    <form method=""post"" action=""/cgitest.cgi%"" enctype=""multipart/form-data"">

I'm getting that odd character appended to the end of the action variable. So my question is this: Since I don't define the action value in the perl script, which environment variable is it using to define its action?

    Unlikely - Should have <u>two</u> of the following:<br> <ul><li>Does not have temporal relationship to intervention,<li>Could readily have been produced by the subject's clinical state,<li>Could have been due to environmental or other interventions,<li>Does not follow known pattern of response to intervention,<li>Does not reappear or worsen with reintroduction of intervention</ul>
    
    Possible - Should have <u>two</u> of the following:<br><ul><li>Has a reasonable temporal relationship to intervention,<li>Could not readily have been produced by the subject's clinical state,<li>Could not readily have been due to environmental or other interventions,<li>Follows a know pattern of response to intervention</ul>
    
    Probably - Should have <u>three</u> of the following:<br><ul><li>Has a resonable temporal relationship to intervention,<li>Could not readily have been produced by the subject's clinical state or have been due to environmental or other interventions,<li>Follows a known pattern of response to intervention,<li>Disappears or decreases with cessation of intervention</ul> <br> <br>
    
    Definitely - Should have <u>all four</u> of the following:<br><ul><li>Has a resonable temporal relationship to the intervention, <li>Could not readily have been produced by the subject's clinical state or have been due to environmental or other interventions,<li>Follows a known pattern of response to intervention,<li>Disappears or decreases with cessation of intervention and recurs with re-exposure</ul>

My ultimate intention is to use SVG graphics inside a iPhone/iPad web app, so have rigged my testing to be geared towards those platfroms. My experimentation was two fold, firstly I wanted to check how to animate the SVG files, and then how best to place inside HTML

I found the best way to animate SVG's was to use the SVG animation properties directly inside the SVG code, here's an example:

    <animate attributeName=""fill"" values=""green; #fff; green"" dur=""4s"" repeatCount=""indefinite"" />

With regards to getting the SVG's into the HTML and keeping the animations intact, I found tha using this worked best:
    
    < embed src=""svgfile.svg"" type=""image/svg+xml"" />	 

** Note that extra styling was required to remove box cropping and border.

Another alternative was to bring in a the SVG via CSS:

    background-image: url(svg_file.svg);
    -webkit-background-size: 100% 100%;
    height: 296px;
    width: 316px;

One thing that does seem a little flakey in Safari is styling SVG elements with CSS -Webkit-animation properties. doesn't seem to work great, but fine in Chrome.

    <a href='Destination URL' target=""_top"" onmouseover=""document.sub_but.src='onrollimage'""onmouseout=""document.sub_but.src='image'""><img src=""image"" width=""281"" height=""55"" name=""sub_but""></a>

2nd way

    <a href=""Destination URL""  onmouseover= ""if (document.images) document.bn_off.src= 'onrollimage';"" onmouseout= ""if (document.images) document.bn_off.src= 'image';""><img src=""image"" name=""bn_off""></a>

now let me tell you something else, by putting both images the same way 1st or 2nd they don't work but if i put the first image the one way and the second image the other way it works fine(i could leave it like this but in the feature i want to put more)

    <a href='Destination URL' target=""_top"" onmouseover=""document.sub_but.src='onrollimage'""onmouseout=""document.sub_but.src='image'""><img src=""image"" width=""281"" height=""55"" name=""sub_but""></a>

2nd way

    <a href=""Destination URL""  onmouseover= ""if (document.images) document.bn_off.src= 'onrollimage';"" onmouseout= ""if (document.images) document.bn_off.src= 'image';""><img src=""image"" name=""bn_off""></a>

now let me tell you something else, by putting both images the same way 1st or 2nd they don't work but if i put the first image the one way and the second image the other way it works fine(i could leave it like this but in the feature i want to put more)
Now please tell me a way that if i put many images hey will work fine

However, their free account can only have a maximum of 5 websites - which I have now met.

Below are the requirements I need in the CMS:

- Simplicity and style to match CushyCMS (or as close as).
- Functionality to match CushyCMS.
- Custom branding so that I can put my logos etc. into the CMS pages (not a must though).
- Can be hosted or installed, if hosted then free, if installed then open source.
- Use a single MySQL database.
- Be able to be implemented into ALREADY EXISTING WEB PAGES! THIS ONE IS A MUST!
- Identify editable regions by simply adding a tag (e.g. classes etc.).
- Keep to the css stylesheet of the website so when entering content it doesn't always automatically insert a `<p>` tag.
- Able to upload new images and place them in editable regions e.g. in amongst a `<p>` tag.

And that's about it I think. Have tried textpattern, orbis, and a few others and none seem to meet my (rather basic?) requirements.

Any and all help greatly apreciated, no sarcasm or smart*** replies please, I'm only asking for help! :)

Cheers.

Some time in the last week or so I made some kind of a change that I absolutely have no idea what I changed that is causing this problem and I've tried reversing the code with no luck.  I have figured out however that the problem goes away if I use a `<th>` in place of a `<td>` in my tables.  Problem is there are thousands of lines of code that have to be modified and I'm using the tables to display my columnar data read out of the db.  If I can avoid having to change the `<td>` tags to `<th>` I will be really happy.

I use css to style the column names.  Can anyone explain why the following now fails when it has worked fine for 8 months now.  I know the code obviously changed somewhere, but I'm clueless where to look....perhaps your explanation will give me an idea where to look in my code.  

This used to work but now displays only grey text in the FIELD_name area:
`<td class=""FIELD_name"">Field Name:</td><td class=""FIELD_text"">small grey text here""</td>`

If I do this I get the proper display (using ""th"" instead of ""td""):
`<th class=""FIELD_name"">Field Name:</th><th class=""FIELD_text"">small grey text here""</th>`

or if I use a span tag like this it also works:
`<td><span class=""FIELD_name"">Field Name:</span></td><td class=""FIELD_text"">small grey text here""</td>`

Here's the CSS:

.FIELD_name {

	font-family: Tahoma;
	font-size: 11px;
	font-style: normal;
	color: #135386;
	font-weight: bold;

I have figured out however that the problem goes away if I use a `<th>` in place of a `<td>` in my tables.  Problem is there are thousands of lines of code that have to be modified and I'm using the tables to display my columnar data read out of the db.  If I can avoid having to change the `<td>` tags to `<th>` I will be really happy.

I use css to style the column names.  Can anyone explain why the following now fails when it has worked fine for 8 months now.  I know the code obviously changed somewhere, but I'm clueless where to look....perhaps your explanation will give me an idea where to look in my code.  

This used to work but now displays only grey text in the FIELD_name area:
`<td class=""FIELD_name"">Field Name:</td><td class=""FIELD_text"">small grey text here""</td>`

If I do this I get the proper display (using ""th"" instead of ""td""):
`<th class=""FIELD_name"">Field Name:</th><th class=""FIELD_text"">small grey text here""</th>`

or if I use a span tag like this it also works:
`<td><span class=""FIELD_name"">Field Name:</span></td><td class=""FIELD_text"">small grey text here""</td>`

Here's the CSS:

.FIELD_name {

	font-family: Tahoma;
	font-size: 11px;
	font-style: normal;
	color: #135386;
	font-weight: bold;
}
.FIELD_text {

	font-family: ""Times New Roman"", Times, serif;
	font-size: 12px;
	font-style: normal;
	color: #666666;
	font-weight: bold;
}

I'm hoping it's just a simple code fix somewhere...your help is appreciated. thanks.",3

I want a block element with a specific size which has three child block elements: A header, a center area and a footer. It must have the following characteristics:

* The header and footer only takes as much height as needed by the content.
* The center area takes all the other space. And with this I mean it REALLY takes all the space and it is not just positioned at the top of the center.
* No JavaScript hacks.
* All sizes are unknown at creation time, so using absolute positioning doesn't work.
* Must work in IE7+, FF3+, Chrome and Safari.

So let's take this example code:

    <div style=""width: 512px; height: 512px"">
      <div class=""head"">This is the header</div>
      <div class=""center"">The is the center area</div>
      <div class=""foot"">This is the footer</div>
    </div>

In the end it should look like this:

    +--------------------------+
    | This is the header       |
    +--------------------------+
    | This is the center area  |
    |                          |
    |                          |

    +--------------------------+
    | This is the footer       |
    +--------------------------+

How can I do this? Even with an old-school table and using height=""100%"" for the center cell I can't get it working because the table is too large then in IE7 (Center area is 512px, so table itself is 512px plus the height of the header and footer cell).

I want a block element with a specific size which has three child block elements: A header, a center area and a footer. It must have the following characteristics:

* The header and footer only takes as much height as needed by the content.
* The center area takes all the other space. And with this I mean it REALLY takes all the space and it is not just positioned at the top of the center.
* No JavaScript hacks.
* All sizes are unknown at creation time, so using absolute positioning doesn't work.
* Must work in IE7+, FF3+, Chrome and Safari.

So let's take this example code:

    <div style=""width: 512px; height: 512px"">
      <div class=""head"">This is the header</div>
      <div class=""center"">The is the center area</div>
      <div class=""foot"">This is the footer</div>
    </div>

In the end it should look like this:

    +--------------------------+
    | This is the header       |
    +--------------------------+
    | This is the center area  |
    |                          |
    |                          |
    |                          |
    |                          |
    |                          |
    +--------------------------+
    | This is the footer       |
    +--------------------------+

i've been trying to do this for a while, but my problem is that I can't find the right learning resources. My preffered method of learning was to learn with good old books on the subject, but many of the books I have been recommended are quite old (the first and apparently only edition of Head-First HTML with CSS and XHTML, a book recommended by many it would seem, was published in 2005 - I presume this is old for the web development world, maybe you can tell me if it is or isn't?), and the problem with online tutorials is that they seem to be so short and not really in-depth enough to learn from.

Anyone knows how to make it look like in example? Thnx",html,css,margin,alignment,,,open,0,363,8,"Element Align Problem - Negative margins, images etc I'm trying to make a header that goes outside the borders of my sidebar and has a shadow image that makes it look like it is a book-mark.

Something similar to this: http://inelmo.com/images/img2.png

Right now I tried my best, but it is not looking correct. here is my code for sidebar and header That I think should work to make this effect, but it isn't.

**HTML**

    <!-- Sidebar -->
    <aside id=""sidebar"">
    
       <!-- header div -->
       <div id=""sideProfile"">
    
          <!-- Span with image background -->
          <span id=""sideHshadow""></span>
    
       </div>
    
    </aside> 




**CSS**

    #sidebar {
            padding: 15px;
            width: 400px;
    }
    
    /*Span with shadow image to make it look like a bookmark */
    #SideHshadow {
    height: 6px;
    width: 12px;
    margin: 0 0 -6px 0;
    float: right;
    background: url(""../images/sidebar_header_shadow.png"") no-repeat;
    }

    background:#333333;
    border-bottom: 1px solid #2d2d2d;
    height: 50px;
    width: 400px;
    margin: 0 -12px 0 0;

in this code class **active_link** is used for showing the current page belongs to the particular menu option, and **top_link** class is used for showing simple form of menu. Then, class **down** is used for indicating the sub-link under the particular menu. Now, i want to show the current active menu for which the particular page is belonging. 

**Ex :** if i'm in **addOfficer.jsp** page, then, **Police Officer** link should show the active. 

To achieving this, i'm pasting the same code in each pages, and just changing  class name **top_link** to **active_link**. And, it is increasing the length of code. Need Help to solve this problem. Thanks in advance !!

Quickly you begin to understand that Adobe can only ever attch the one PDF to an email at the one time, no more Pdf's can be attached.

then the idea qickly circum navigats to creating a VBA form that displays all the attachments collected throughout the PDF by a copy move .bat extension that places the selected files in a temporary folder.

Here's my relevant code for Perl so far:
  
  

    #Opening the file      
      open(DATA, $_) || die ""Can't open $file: $!\n"";
    
      #Looping through the end of the file

       {

       if (/(.*?)\s+\d+\s+(\d+\.\d+)\%/){
       #Populating the hash with only Process name and % (eg: Idle 94.00%)
        $cpu_util{ $1 } = $2;
        }
       }
    
      #Assigning the axis labels to be pushed onto the graph
      @xvalues = keys %cpu_util;
      @yvalues = values %cpu_util;  
     
      #print Dumper( \%cpu_util);
      
      ## Printing the Graph ##
      #print ""#Before addition with the array"";
      #print Dumper( \@yvalues);
         
      #Only adding the y-values, since the x-values remain constant
      @y_graph = pairwise { $a + $b } @y_graph, @yvalues;

      }

      #number of files read (count)

      my @table_data; 
      push(@table_data, \@xvalues); 
      push(@table_data, \@y_graph); 

 -------------


Now, I am able to successfully prase data from multiple files and be able to display a single graph. However, what I'd like to be able to do is, inaddition to displaying just one graph. Provide the user to select which process their interested in and then create a line graph of those points.
 
However, I'm not completely sure how to go about this. I know all my proccesses are stored in my hash via key/value pairs. So (""Idle -> 94%"") etc. What I'd like to end up doing is show a user, a drop down box ... and it lists all the keys in the hash. When the user selected a specific key, it generates a GD::Graph for him. I guess, I will generate the graphs for each key before hand itself and save them as images. Selecting a specific option merely links them to the right image ...
 
Any pointers would be appreciated!

Convince me.","I know this topic's been close to done to death and the answer is pretty unequivocally ""div/css"" (you fool!) and I swear I want to be good and strictly use divs, but seriously tables give me quick *reliable* layout solutions for a handful of cases. 

It makes me sad that these things are _so_ hard using css, but _so_ easy with tables? What do I do? What are my alternatives? 

---

case 1: must *space evenly* across certain width (eg 100%)

My client wants a horizontal menu that's 100% and spaces evenly across that width, where they have can add or remove items themselves (ie I'm not always going to be there to get the spacing right for them) -- this is a **common design**, really what is my alternative to a table here?


    100%
    <-------------------------------------------------------------------------->
    div/css:
    ------------------------------------------------------------
    | menu item | super long menu item | menu item | menu item |
    ------------------------------------------------------------
    table:
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |   menu item   |   super long menu item   |   menu item   |   menu item   |
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

NB this is **not** a case where `float: left` `<li>` will work as the spacing will be all wrong. This question is about determining the *width* of the element dynamically (without going mad or having to use js or both).

---

case 2: reliable liquid columns (with 100% height)

**div/css: 50 lines** -- cut/paste from a liquid 2 column generater from the internet (pagecolumn.com)<br>
http://dpaste.com/hold/579540/

**table: 40 lines**<br>
http://dpaste.com/hold/579538/

Maybe it's just me but the table version looks way more sane -- like it has less strange wrappy action. 

I know the table version isn't going to bork in 99% of cases (it will never *ever*, not even on the most insane browser do the pop-below trick if the browser decides to change its interpretation of margins/paddings). 

I know that both columns *will* show even if the browser window is <250px wide.

Blow-for-blow why would I choose the css solution in this case?

There were a couple more (like vertical-align which is just a cheap shot) but what it boils down to and the answer I'm looking for is this: 

In my mind when I sit down to make a new website and consider these things the div/css argument is not strong nor reliable enough. I _want_ to go that way but my instinct says that in the long term there-be-dragons.

Tables are _reliable_ for layout. I feel like I'm trading in for an inferior product. Floats, z-indexes and positions whilst being really fun and interesting don't feel like work-horses for real production websites with nuffy IE-using clients in the real world. 

Tell me how ditching tables will make some other part of my production/design process solid and easier.

Give me some practical non-esoteric benefits.

Help me stackoverflow.",html,css,table,layout,div,07/27/2011 13:54:17,not constructive,1,518,10,"Tables v. div/css layout -- quick, easy, reliable? Convince me. I know this topic's been close to done to death and the answer is pretty unequivocally ""div/css"" (you fool!) and I swear I want to be good and strictly use divs, but seriously tables give me quick *reliable* layout solutions for a handful of cases. 

It makes me sad that these things are _so_ hard using css, but _so_ easy with tables? What do I do? What are my alternatives? 

---

case 1: must *space evenly* across certain width (eg 100%)

My client wants a horizontal menu that's 100% and spaces evenly across that width, where they have can add or remove items themselves (ie I'm not always going to be there to get the spacing right for them) -- this is a **common design**, really what is my alternative to a table here?


    100%
    <-------------------------------------------------------------------------->
    div/css:
    ------------------------------------------------------------
    | menu item | super long menu item | menu item | menu item |
    ------------------------------------------------------------
    table:
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |   menu item   |   super long menu item   |   menu item   |   menu item   |
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

NB this is **not** a case where `float: left` `<li>` will work as the spacing will be all wrong. This question is about determining the *width* of the element dynamically (without going mad or having to use js or both).

---

case 2: reliable liquid columns (with 100% height)

**div/css: 50 lines** -- cut/paste from a liquid 2 column generater from the internet (pagecolumn.com)<br>
http://dpaste.com/hold/579540/

**table: 40 lines**<br>
http://dpaste.com/hold/579538/

Maybe it's just me but the table version looks way more sane -- like it has less strange wrappy action. 

I know the table version isn't going to bork in 99% of cases (it will never *ever*, not even on the most insane browser do the pop-below trick if the browser decides to change its interpretation of margins/paddings). 

I know that both columns *will* show even if the browser window is <250px wide.

Blow-for-blow why would I choose the css solution in this case?

=======
We are using Sitecore, a content editor is filling in a rich-text box field. 

This rich-text box field gives them an option to put in html to have more control over the content styles. So they decide to put in some CSS.

They provide the html and CSS below. The CSS adding images below relating to `.button` and `.button145x28` do not work. 

The odd thing is when we do the same method of adding an image using back-ground image for `.cutOffCorner` it works. 

We are trying to see what would be stopping the below from actually working.

The problem is (or was) that if a user pressed enter on the last (or any other) input within the form, the submit button that seemed to be called was the ""load saved formed"" which is at the top of the form. All attempts to user javascript to have the return button default to the ""save form"" seemed useless, almost as if the browser was too busy already submitting the form to have any js interfere.

Finally, in FireFox 3.5, I actually had the server-side script echo out what it received for the `post` variable and discovered that none of the submit button values were being passed back to the server. As it turns out, I have hooks in the script for when the user hits ""Save"" or ""Save and Print"", etc, but if the user uses the ""load page"" it simply updates a variable and continues loading the page normally with that variable in context. 

So with no submit button value at all, it did the same thing, it simply loaded the page.

So, on to the big question:

Is this typical browser behavior? Maybe even reliable browser behavior? Will hitting enter always submit the form as though no submit button was pressed at all, or do some browsers like to pick a button to use as the default when the user presses enter?

If it is typical behavior, what is the suggested course of action? I was going to have the script save anything no matter what, so long as there was data in the form, but then I realized that this was even more dangerous, because if the user loads one saved form, changes there mind, and changes the form dates and hits ""Load Form"", then it will save the form data from the pervious form for the new dates they have requested.

I considered setting it up so that *changing* the load form inputs (selects with dates and other particulars) would clear the form so that the server still recieved an empty form and thus would not overwrite any previous data, but this is risky as well, as many users will certainly notice and think that their data has been lost, etc, and there is always the slight chance that the user will be almost done with the form, go up to the top and fiddle with the form-load selects just to confirm they chose the right what nots and then be forced to start from scratch.

I should just have two forms, one for loading, one for the data, but the problem with that is that all of the data in the load part of the form does get used by the main form. I could write more js to combine the two on submit, or hide the data in the second form, but all of that seems clunky.


Essentially, I need a setup such that the top part of the form is independent of the main form, but not vice versa. Submitting the upper form does not submit the lower, but submitting the lower does submit the higher.

Okay,I've gone on long enough. Basically I'm wondering if a solution already exists or if anyone else has run into this and found a clever fix.

    </html>",html,image,hyperlink,links,,01/14/2012 06:13:06,too localized,1,1252,7,"HTML Hyperlinked Images Disappear Only When Hyperlinked? I apologize for the simplicity that I'm sure the answer to this question is, but whenever I make certain images hyperlinked (the ""logo.png"" in the below code) they are not present when one views the page, including having no clickable area. The image shows when not hyperlinked however. Any help would be amazing!

ps. I figured I'd post the whole pages html instead of just the little bit of problem code; more importantly, yes, I have verified that the directory paths to the images are correct.

I would expect to see two boxes of identical size, but the bottom box (the `<button>`) is noticeably smaller. This behavior is consistent across all the browsers I tried it on, both Windows (Chrome, FireFox, IE, Opera) and Android (built-in browser and Dolphin).

I tried adding `display: block;` to the style, thinking that that might make them both render using the same rules (i.e., make the `button` render like a `div` since it's a block element now), but that had no effect -- the button remained smaller.

As I increase the border width, the disparity increases. It looks as though the button's `border` is *inside* its `width`, rather than above and beyond its `width` as with the `<div>`. As far as I understand it, this violates the [box model](http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/box.html), though the W3C does say:

> [user agents may render borders for certain user interface elements (e.g., buttons, menus, etc.) differently than for ""ordinary"" elements](http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/box.html#border-properties).

Is it normal / documented / expected behavior for a `button` to have its border on the inside of its width and height, rather than outside? Can I rely on this behavior?

I have a page with some clickable `<div>` elements, and I want to change them to `<button>`s instead to make it easier to identify them via jQuery. But when I change the `<div>`s to `<button>`s, their size changes. (I'm styling them as fixed width and height, but the button renders at a different width and height than the div does.)

Here's a jsfiddle that reproduces the problem: http://jsfiddle.net/AjmGY/

I tried setting a background, but it won't appear behind the number if `list-style-position` is set to `outside`. I tried setting it with a background and `list-style-position: inside`, then putting the text inside the `li` in a `div` to align it, but no combination of floats, margins, etc worked without wrapping around the numeral.

Does anybody have an idea to achieve a flexible layout as illustrated below?<br/>
Case 1 (any alternative) and Case 2 must be possible without knowing the width of the text.

Since Stack Overflow does not allow me to directly include the illustration image here, have a look at

",html,css,firefox,,,,open,0,238,9,"CSS in Firefox: Div doesn't appear in right position I'm designing a web page at: http://trackstudent.pt/index.php

I ran into a bug that I can't fix, if you notice after inspecting the link, the `<p></p>` is getting pushed to the right, by a measure and I can't figure out why. All the divs have margin:0, padding:0 and there's enough space so that that element should fit that space.

Amazingly in the 2nd row of content that thing doesn't happen.

So here are my questions:

 1. When should a CMS be used? Should I ALWAYS use a CMS when building a customer's site and if so what is the best one to learn? I have a little experience with Wordpress but that's it.

 2. Should I invoice the client for hosting/domain name etc and then host them myself or should I continue to give the files to my clients? 

 3. I consider myself to be very good at design and my html and css knowledge can back up my design skills very well. However, I have no knowledge of any backend programming languages, is it common for web designers to learn a backend technology as well as front? or is it more common that they would find a back end developer to help them when needed?


If some one could answer one or all of these questions it would be very helpful to me, or if some one could just walk me through their process if they are already in the industry.

Over the last few years I changed over to dashes, mostly to align myself with the [trend in the community][1], not necessarily because it made sense to me.

I've always thought dashes have more drawbacks, and I don't see the benefits:

### Code completion 

Most editors treat dashes as word separators, so I can't tab through to the symbol I want. Say the class is ""`featured-product`"", I have to auto-complete ""`featured`"", enter a hyphen, and complete ""`product`"".

With underscores ""`featured_product`"" is treated as one word, so it can be filled in one step.

(More generally, I think of classes and ids as _tokens_, so it doesn't make sense to me that a token should be so easily splittable on hyphens.)

### Ambiguity with arithmetic operator

Using dashes breaks object-property [access to form elements][2] in JavaScript. This is only possible with underscores:

    form.first_name.value='Stormageddon';

(Admittedly I don't access form elements this way myself, but when deciding on dashes vs underscores as a universal rule, consider that someone might.)

Languages like [Sass][3] (especially throughout the [Compass][4] framework) have settled on dashes as a standard, even for variable names. They originally used underscores in the beginning too. The fact that this is parsed differently strikes me as odd:

    $list-item-10
    $list-item - 10

### Inconsistency with variable naming across languages

Back in the day, I used to write `underscored_names` for variables in PHP, ruby, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript. This was convenient and consistent, but again in order to ""fit in"" I now use:

* `dash-case` in HTML/CSS
* `camelCase` in JavaScript
* `underscore_case` in PHP and ruby

This doesn't really bother me too much, but I wonder why these became so misaligned, seemingly on purpose. At least with underscores it was possible to maintain consistency:

    var featured_product = $('#featured_product'); // instead of
    var featuredProduct = $('#featured-product');

The differences create situations where we have to [translate strings][5] unnecessarily, along with the potential for bugs.

So I ask: Why did the community almost universally settle on dashes, and are there any reasons that outweigh underscores?

There is a [related question][6] from back around the time this started, but I'm of the opinion that it's not (or _shouldn't_ have been) just a matter of taste. I'd like to understand why we all settled on this convention if it really was just a matter of taste.

2420809,03/10/2010 21:36:14,195446,10/23/2009 16:37:10,87,14,"Disregarding speed and compatibility, why not use only classes and never use IDs in HTML/CSS ?","I use only classes and never use IDs.
Many people like to use IDs for different reasons.

I've seen many questions regarding IDs vs classes on stackoverflow, but no one addressed pure code organization point of view disregarding compatibility and runtime performance.

From code organization point of view, I think that using IDs is bad just like using global variables in Visual Basic code.

One reason is that IDs have to be unique which introduces unnecessary and bad dependency between different independent parts of your code (controlling different parts of HTML DOM tree).

Another reason is that making new class names is actually easier than ID names because with IDs you have to worry about global scope and with class names you need to worry only about uniqueness in local scope, same benefit as with local variables.

Most people will argue that performance of addressing by ID is better than by class and I will agree with that. But as browsers become more advanced with native implementations of CSS addressing from javascript and computers become faster, performance becomes less and less important. So let's disregard it and concentrate only on organization of code in context of current question.

This discussion started [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/298607/css-best-practice-about-id-and-class/2413100#2413100), but my potentially wrong advice generates negative points and became too big to keep in comments, so here I try to convert it into something positive and manageable.

One visible point in favor of IDs is to use them as a tool of rule prioritization because priority of #name is higher than priority of .name.
My response: using IDs to raise priorities is bad hack, it's cleaner and there is more freedom if you use additional root elements inserted between body and other levels of tree, for example priority of <code>body div div span.class1{}</code> is higher than <code>body div span.class1{}</code> is higher than <code>body span.class1{}</code> is higher than <code>span.class1{}</code>. Another tool to use for that purpose is <code>!important</code>.
Some may argue that using more root elements means more difficulties when the page structure changes, but I don't think this is the case because you never have to put anything between body and designated for prioritization divs. Those divs can always stay below body and above all other content.

Another interesting association was brought about pointers and that IDs are not bad because pointers are not bad.
My response: pointers are bad if you hardcode absolute memory address in your code. Using relative pointers is always better (examples: using segments(CS,DS,SS,ES) in 8086 CPU; relative variable and method addresses generated by compilers). If we consider DOM tree as memory and compare using ID to using class then <code>#name</code> represents absolute memory address, but <code>div.tab1 .name</code> represents relative address (relative to <code>div.tab1</code>).

Another supporting point that I've seen for IDs is that elements with IDs are more easily available in javascript as becoming global properties. My response: again, this is like saying that global variables in Visual Basic are more conveniently available. The problem is that you can't keep large enough global (or any other) namespace in order without introducing naming hierarchy like level1_level2_name, which is just a hack to replace one namespace mechanism with another. DOM tree is convenient enough to organize namespaces, why disregard it ?
",html,css,javascript,,,03/11/2010 14:24:37,not constructive,1,524,16,"Disregarding speed and compatibility, why not use only classes and never use IDs in HTML/CSS ? I use only classes and never use IDs.
Many people like to use IDs for different reasons.

I've seen many questions regarding IDs vs classes on stackoverflow, but no one addressed pure code organization point of view disregarding compatibility and runtime performance.

From code organization point of view, I think that using IDs is bad just like using global variables in Visual Basic code.

One reason is that IDs have to be unique which introduces unnecessary and bad dependency between different independent parts of your code (controlling different parts of HTML DOM tree).

Another reason is that making new class names is actually easier than ID names because with IDs you have to worry about global scope and with class names you need to worry only about uniqueness in local scope, same benefit as with local variables.

Most people will argue that performance of addressing by ID is better than by class and I will agree with that. But as browsers become more advanced with native implementations of CSS addressing from javascript and computers become faster, performance becomes less and less important. So let's disregard it and concentrate only on organization of code in context of current question.

so I need to display the middle colored one on hover state, although the last one for the current state, of course the current state wasn't need hover effect..

I know, It should call like this.. 


    ul#top-nav-links li a.company01:hover{background-position:-100px -31px;}

but I curious if somehow that code should be shortened by avoiding to call each menu as separate instead like this...

    ul#top-nav-links li a:hover(background-position:0px -31px;}

the above one I tried but the horizontal positioning of the image wasn't possible..

I m developing a simple video chat application. Whenever I move a flash object within the dom tree, it resets itself. I know there is no solution for it which is a browser specific behaviour. However, I would like to ask whether there is any workaround to do this. My requirements are simple. I have multiple streams which are aligned horizontally. Every stream is a different flash object. When someone enlarges a single Flash object, I need to move it to the top. Whenever I move it to the top, that particular video resets itself, and you wait for a couple of second to get the stream back. Is there any workaround or any way to avoid this. 

I am currently simply prepending the same list item to the same parent. This is a very important feature and any kind of solution which doesn't require flash to reset itself is acceptable. (Except creating a parent flash container which has all the streams within it.)

Thanks,

This problem is driving me to insanity so I hope for a simple solution  

This is what I wanted originally:
[Click to see image of what I want][1]

But I didnt want to use hacks to get Box 1 and (Box 2+Box 3) to expand with each other. So I will just use a background color on the wrapper instead so its not noticeable that they have different heights.

This is what I have now:

CSS:

    #wrapper {
	background:			#000;
	width:				50%; 
	float:				left;
}

#box1 {
	background:			#FF0012;
	width:				65%;
	float:				left;
}

#box2 {
	background:			#141; 
	width:				35%;
	margin-left:		65%;	
}


#box3 {
	background:#AA1232;

  div id=""box2"">

  div id=""box3"">

  /div>

 /div>

/body>


If you wonder why I dont use float: right; on Box 2 and 3 its because if Box 1 is lower than Box 2 then Box 3 will float under Box 1 instead of under Box 2.

Problem:
1. Fix Box 3 to the bottom of the wrapper
2. When rows are inserted in Box 3 and Box 2, they shouldn't overflow - expand the wrappers height instead (as it does with the code i posted)

If I use position: absolute; bottom: 0; on Box 3 then it will overflow Box 2 when rows are inserted and Box 3 gets too heigh.

Any ideas of how to solve this?

I'm using Firefox 8 and I have a UL element that's located inside a div tag, the div tag is animated with the jQuery UI Accordion widget as the following markup shows:

        <a class=""ui-accordion-header"">Section 1</a>
        <ul style=""width: 250px !important;"">

           </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

My problem is that in Firefox the inline width style for the <ul> tag gets overwritten and reset to 0px.  So the above ends up getting rendered in Firefox as follows:


    <div id=""accordion"">
        <a class=""ui-accordion-header"">Section 1</a>
        <ul style=""width: 0px;"">

        </ul>
    </div>


This does not happen in Chrome or IE and I have no idea what is causing this in FF.  Ideally I would like to set the style from jQuery, I had just set it inline to test and sure enough it gets overwritten and reset back to 0px.  Is there some browser setting or feature in the Firefox rendering engine that causes this behavior.

When a thumbnail is clicked I want to reload the list with the clicked thumbnail becoming the first image followed by the rest of the list in order, without reloading the rest of the webpage. 

My PartialView contains the following code which loads the thumbnails and assigns each an Url.Action.

`<% foreach (var image in (ImageModel)ViewData.Model) { %>
        <a href='<%= Url.Action(""ImageList"", ""ImageView"", new { imageFolderName = image.Folder, imageFile = ImageHelper.GetImageName(image.Path) }, null) %>'>
        <img src=""/images/<%= image.Path %>"" height=""<%=(image.Height/4).ToString() %>"" width=""<%=(image.Width/4).ToString() %>"" alt=""""  /></a>
    <% }%>` 

My controller has an ActionResult for initially loading the partial view when the containing page is loaded. I also included a method returning PartialViewResult.

public class ImageViewController : Controller

        public ActionResult ImageView(string imageFolderName, string imageFile)
        {
            return View(new ImageModel(imageFolderName, imageFile));

        {
            return PartialView(new ImageModel(imageFolderName, imageFile));
        }

If I set the Url.Action to (""ImageList"", ""ImageList""... the thumbnails are refreshed exactly the way I want, but the whole page is refreshed instead of just the partial view.

When I set Url.Action to (""ImageList"", ""ImageView""... instead of the partial view of the containing page getting refreshed, the containing page is gone and the partial page is loaded without it. That is, I see all my thumbnails in the correct order on a blank white web page.

I'm a noob and I haven't been able to make sense of any jQuery or Ajax Q and A about PartialViews in a way that it would apply to this scenario. 

What good is a controller method that returns PartialView if it loads a new webpage instead of just refreshing the partial view within its containing page?

May be someone know how to stretch it to whole free space inside table?

IE7, in all it's glory, takes my inline CSS and modifies it to include ""background-color: transparent"" in it.

**Homepage** - Content, TripelFirst, TripelSecond, TripelThird
<br/>**Concept** and **Rentals** page - Content, AsideFirst, AsideSecond
<br/>**Press** and **Service Department** page - Content, AsideFirst, AsideSecond (different layout then the previous two pages)

Note: Even though all of the pages have the Content zone, except Homepage none of the pages uses it. Other pages only have HTML widgets located in one of the zones.

1) I've read that it is possible to create the layout for the specific ID, the problem is I can't find that ID to create the layout for specific ID.

2) As you can see, couple of pages have the same layout, how to assign them to the specific layout? For example, if I create the layout for **Concept** and **Rentals** page how can I assign the specific layout to them.

3) How to add the class tag to the body? The problem is that Orchard CMS creates the body before everything else so it isn't contained in the layout cshtml files.

Pages and zones within it:

**Homepage** - Content, TripelFirst, TripelSecond, TripelThird
<br/>**Concept** and **Rentals** page - Content, AsideFirst, AsideSecond
<br/>**Press** and **Service Department** page - Content, AsideFirst, AsideSecond (different layout then the previous two pages)

Note: Even though all of the pages have the Content zone, except Homepage none of the pages uses it. Other pages only have HTML widgets located in one of the zones.

1) I've read that it is possible to create the layout for the specific ID, the problem is I can't find that ID to create the layout for specific ID.

2) As you can see, couple of pages have the same layout, how to assign them to the specific layout? For example, if I create the layout for **Concept** and **Rentals** page how can I assign the specific layout to them.

3) How to add the class tag to the body? The problem is that Orchard CMS creates the body before everything else so it isn't contained in the layout cshtml files.
