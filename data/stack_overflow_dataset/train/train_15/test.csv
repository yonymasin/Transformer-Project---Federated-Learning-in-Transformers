Here is my [demo fiddle][1].

I also have a border and background color applied to this div. The issue arises in Firefox. There is a small amount of whitespace between the border and the background-color of the div (see images below). It is very minimal, but people have noticed it nonetheless. It looks like a lighting effect on the corner.

Is this a known issue with rounded corners in Firefox? IE, Chrome, and Opera are fine.

FYI/ For the purposes of illustrating the issue I have made the border and background-color the same even though it's redundant. It makes the whitespace stand out more.

1 big div (main), and 3 divs inside it, a left shadow, content, and a right shadow.

I want this to be viewable in big and small screens, the problem is that when viewing in small screens or making the window small, the main div height goes below the height of content div, so the shadow is too short to cover content div.  
I've been playing with min-height, but min-height:auto, doesn't work, and none of the values of ""overflow"" does what I want.  
Any clean way of solving this that works on any browsers?
Should I use javascript?, redo everything another way?

I'd like to get a clear and definitive answer that proves things either way.

##Is making an entire website run in HTTPS not an issue today from a best practice and performance perspective?

**Context:**
The conversation came up when we wanted to introduce some buttons that spawn lightboxes with forms in them that collect personal information (some of them even allow users to login). This is on pages that make up a big portion of the site. Since the forms would need to collect and submit information securely and the forms are not on pages of their own, the easiest way we could see to make this possible was to make the pages themselves be HTTPS.

What I would like is for an answer that covers issues with switching a long running popular site to HTTPS such as the ones listed below:

 1. Would a handshake must be negotiated on every request?
 1. Will all assets need to be encrypted?
 1. Would browsers not cache HTTPS content, including assets?
 1. Is downstream transparent proxies not caching HTTPS content, including assets (css, js etc.) still an issue?
 1. Would all external assets (tracking pixels, videos, etc) need to have HTTPS version?
 1. HTTPS and gzip might not be happy together?
 1. Backlinks and organic links will always be HTTP so you will be 301'ing all the time, does this impact SEO?

There's a move with some of the big players to always run HTTPS, see [Always on SSL][1], is this setting a precedent / best practice?

I have tried using dl/dt/dd and horrible table/tr/td and even ul/li type forms.  All suffer similar issues.  Some browsers, such as firefox are only slightly out, but chrome & iOS highlight the problem well.  Ideally a solution that specifically works in android and ios browsers would be good.

I have site where each user is linked to an ID in the Database and this Primary Key is included in many tables. The fastest way for me to pull a users information is to have this ID.

Would it be considered bad practice to put this ID in website HTML code? eg id=""theIDnumber""

Otherwise i can just use the username and then reference this in the Database for this ID - which is fine but using the ID would be faster I believe.

thoughts?

What's happening is I have three large divs that are theoretically supposed to be aligned one next to the other, but the third one drops down all the way to the bottom right, despite all my width values being added up to 100%. Thanks in advance everyone, as usual.

I tried two approaches:

###Using the Clipboard###

 1. In HTML mode.
 1. Getting the Word.Range from the Word.Selection.
 1. Doing a range.Copy() to put it in the clipboard
 1. Convert inputString to outputString
 1. Replacing the selection with outputString with range.PasteSpecial(...)

###Using the Open XML Format###

 1. In HTML mode.
 1. Getting the Word.Range from the Word.Selection.
 1. Doing a range.Copy() to put it in the clipboard
 1. Convert inputString to outputString (in Office Open XML format, knowing how to craft it to produce a specific HTML).
 1. Replacing the selection with outputString with range.InsertXML(...)

The issues are:

 1. When using the clipboard it crashes sometimes. There are references about checking the clipboard state but I think I've tried the known alternatives.
 1. To use the insertXML you need to have Microsoft Word installed. You can't do an insertXML with Outlook installed alone. Look at: [Impact of deploying Outlook 2007 without Word 2007][1] for further information.

Do you know more alternatives? I can think of adding the elements myself like using InsertParagraph, but I am not sure if I can add hyperlinks or will experience similar issues.

Setting the option `die_on_bad_params => 0` to the `HTML::Template->new` method seems to allow the comment format of the template names to work, can anyone confirm that this is the correct way to accomplish this?",3

Having each Fullcalendar use its own scrollbar has been rejected; accordingly, all the calendars are displayed full-length, with a single scrollbar set in the surrounding div.

The problem now is to have the headers stay fixed during vertical scrolling.  There are other requirements for extended header functionality (additional data, icons, links, etc.), so it made more sense to me to make my own headers above each Fullcalendar div.

Using CSS and placing the divs correctly, I was able to get the calendars to vertically scroll separately from the headers, thus achieving a 'fixed header' effect.  The problem was then horizontal scrolling:  if I made the divs extend outward horizontally, then the vertical scrollbar for the div containing the calendars was all the way to the right, outside of visibility.

I have also tried plugins for fixed headers by setting using a <table> with arbitrary text for the headers and then putting the Fullcalendar divs inside <td> elements in a single row.  These all failed in different ways (hiding the calendars, reprinting the headers, other ways).

Here is the base setup:  http://jsfiddle.net/Bdtjh/.  I am looking for some direction in how to have the main content area have (1) both vertical and horizontal scrollbars as necessary, (2) keep the column headers fixed when vertical scrolling, and (3) synchronize the horizontal scrolling of the column headers and calendars underneath them.

Ok alright I know that supposedly it's more secure (XSS prevention), but I find all that quite questionable and even if it is(which i highly doubt) it still might be not worth increased complexity:

 - First if you only support couple simple tags like [i], [u] there is really not much difference in looking for [i] or &lt;i&gt; tags in text.
 - Second by definition BBCode's and HTML's purpose is identical - markup of text and BBcode does not improve on HTML in any way (aside from dubious security claims) in comparison to lets say Markdown which is significantly more human readable than ether of those.
 - BBCode has no standart, there is some supposedly common set of stuff, but overall it seems very much like - make stuff up as you go along
 - If you choose to use BBCode, you now have one more language at your project and introducing multiple languages to project is rarely a good idea unless it brings significant benefits.
 - If you use more complicated BBCode you have to have BBCode to HTML converter and here one could argue what is easier - securing subset of HTML that you need, or writing good parser. Besides there are free libs for HTML cleanup, so again why use additional language?
 - If you choose to use JavaScript rich text editor, like CKEditor or TinyMCE, and you still want to store BBCode you have to write code for conversion from HTML to BBCode, possibly in JavaScript, so again even more code that might harbor nasty bugs. Also when writing converters you have to remember - there is no standart!

From all of this it seems to me that BBCode is lousy choice. However it seems that lots of people on the web are convinced that is great. I'm calling it into question.

How can I get the wrap div to always fill the cell, so that the management area sits at the bottom of the cell?  And yes, the data that I am putting in the table is (in my mind) tabular, so I would like to use a table here.  As a last resort, I may turn to an ugly nested div solution, but since a table is semantically correct here I'd like to use one if possible.

One part of this is having the text move down 1px inside the button when it is pressed. I've done this by adding an additional pixel to the top and removing one from the bottom.

Unfortunately, I've designed my button to work inline (inline-block) and when the button is ""pushed"" it means any text on the line also gets pushed down. Now I think I know why (presumably due to the baseline of the text) but I wonder if anyone knows how I can get the same ""pushed"" effect whilst keeping surrounding text in place.

",html,css,css3,inline-block,,,open,0,475,5,"Keeping inline text in place I have been making a button which (hopefully) looks fairly realistic. One part of this is having the text move down 1px inside the button when it is pressed. I've done this by adding an additional pixel to the top and removing one from the bottom.

Unfortunately, I've designed my button to work inline (inline-block) and when the button is ""pushed"" it means any text on the line also gets pushed down. Now I think I know why (presumably due to the baseline of the text) but I wonder if anyone knows how I can get the same ""pushed"" effect whilst keeping surrounding text in place. I would like to avoid floats if possible.

2502387,03/23/2010 18:02:14,738601,03/23/2010 11:39:44,6,0,HTML/CSS - No 100% height on div in IE,"Okay, so I've got a problem - and I'd love to have it fixed.

I am using my favourite way of setting up a simple header/content/footer layout.
The problem is that any elements I add to the 'content' div of my layout can not be expanded to 100% in Internet Explorer (as far as I know, IE only).
I understand there is no height declared to the 'content' element, but because of the style of its positioning (declaring an absolute top AND bottom), the element fills the desired area. (The content element has a background color defined so you can see that the div is in fact filling between both the header and the footer.)

So my problem is, since the div is clearly expanded between the two, why can't a child be set to 100% to fill that area?
If anyone has any solutions, I'd love to hear them. (I'm looking for a solution that won't involve designing by an entire different layout.. or at least perhaps an explanation of why this is happening. I'm assuming at this point it's because of the lack of a height declaration -- but the div is expanded, so I don't get it!)

I want to avoid duplicating any CSS rules for  the background gradient color or background image position, because they will be the same for each heading. In other words, the only thing I should need to specify for an individual heading is the path to the background image file.

Here's what I have at the moment:

    <h1 class=""banner bgImage img1"">background image 1</h1>
    <h1 class=""banner bgImage img2"">background image 2</h1>
    <h1 class=""banner bgImage img3"">background image 3</h1>
    <h1 class=""banner bgImage"">heading without background image</h1>

    .banner {
        /* For old browsers that don't support gradients */
        background-color: #9FCC1D; 
        
        /* browser-specific prefixes omitted */
        background-image: linear-gradient(#75A319, #9FCC1D); 
        padding: 7px 7px 7px 15px;
    }
    
    /* Specifies position of background image */
    .bgImage {
        background-position: 5px 50%;
        background-repeat: no-repeat;
        padding-left: 30px;
    }
    
    .img1 {
        background-image: url(img1.png""), linear-gradient(#75A319, #9FCC1D);
    }
    
    .img2 {
        background-image: url(img2.png""), linear-gradient(#75A319, #9FCC1D);
    }
    
    .img3 {
        background-image: url(img3.png""), linear-gradient(#75A319, #9FCC1D);
    }

There are a couple of problems with this

 1. I have to repeat the `linear-gradient` style in each `.imgX` rule
 2. The `background-position` property in `.bgImage` applies to both the gradient and the background image. The result is that the gradient doesn't cover the entire width of the header. Here's a screenshot of how it looks at the moment.

How can I fix the problem with the position of the gradient while minimising duplication of CSS rules?
