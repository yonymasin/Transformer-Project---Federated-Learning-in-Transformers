There is no fear in him-let him not die,
For he will live and laugh at this hereafter.
                                              Clock strikes.
'Tis time to part.
Caesar, I will. [Aside.] And so near will I be
That your best friends shall wish I had been further.
Fled to his house amazed.
Men, wives, and children stare, cry out, and run
As it were doomsday.
