What, will he not to bed?
To-morrow then, belike, shall be the day,
If Warwick be so near as men report.
'Tis the more honour, because more dangerous.
Ay, wherefore else guard we his royal tent
But to defend his person from night-foes?
         Enter WARWICK, CLARENCE, OXFORD, SOMERSET,
               and French soldiers, silent all
Stay, or thou diest.
   WARWICK and the rest cry all 'Warwick! Warwick!' and
  set upon the guard, who fly, crying 'Arm! Arm!' WARWICK
               and the rest following them
  The drum playing and trumpet sounding, re-enter WARWICK
     and the rest, bringing the KING out in his gown,
