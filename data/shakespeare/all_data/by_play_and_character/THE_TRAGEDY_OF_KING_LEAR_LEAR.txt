Attend the lords of France and Burgundy, Gloucester.
Meantime we shall express our darker purpose.
 Give me the map there. Know we have divided
 In three our kingdom; and 'tis our fast intent
 To shake all cares and business from our age,
 Conferring them on younger strengths while we
 Unburthen'd crawl toward death. Our son of Cornwall,
 And you, our no less loving son of Albany,
 We have this hour a constant will to publish
 Our daughters' several dowers, that future strife
 May be prevented now. The princes, France and Burgundy,
 Great rivals in our youngest daughter's love,
 Long in our court have made their amorous sojourn,
 And here are to be answer'd. Tell me, my daughters
 (Since now we will divest us both of rule,
 Interest of territory, cares of state),
 Which of you shall we say doth love us most?
 That we our largest bounty may extend
 Where nature doth with merit challenge. Goneril,
 Our eldest-born, speak first.
Of all these bounds, even from this line to this,
 With shadowy forests and with champains rich'd,
 With plenteous rivers and wide-skirted meads,
 We make thee lady. To thine and Albany's issue
 Be this perpetual.- What says our second daughter,
 Our dearest Regan, wife to Cornwall? Speak.
To thee and thine hereditary ever
 Remain this ample third of our fair kingdom,
 No less in space, validity, and pleasure
 Than that conferr'd on Goneril.- Now, our joy,
 Although the last, not least; to whose young love
 The vines of France and milk of Burgundy
 Strive to be interest; what can you say to draw
 A third more opulent than your sisters? Speak.
Nothing?
Nothing can come of nothing. Speak again.
How, how, Cordelia? Mend your speech a little,
 Lest it may mar your fortunes.
But goes thy heart with this?
So young, and so untender?
Let it be so! thy truth then be thy dower!
 For, by the sacred radiance of the sun,
 The mysteries of Hecate and the night;
 By all the operation of the orbs
 From whom we do exist and cease to be;
 Here I disclaim all my paternal care,
 Propinquity and property of blood,
 And as a stranger to my heart and me
 Hold thee from this for ever. The barbarous Scythian,
 Or he that makes his generation messes
 To gorge his appetite, shall to my bosom
 Be as well neighbour'd, pitied, and reliev'd,
 As thou my sometime daughter.
Peace, Kent!
 Come not between the dragon and his wrath.
 I lov'd her most, and thought to set my rest
 On her kind nursery.- Hence and avoid my sight!-
 So be my grave my peace as here I give
 Her father's heart from her! Call France! Who stirs?
 Call Burgundy! Cornwall and Albany,
 With my two daughters' dowers digest this third;
 Let pride, which she calls plainness, marry her.
 I do invest you jointly in my power,
 Preeminence, and all the large effects
 That troop with majesty. Ourself, by monthly course,
 With reservation of an hundred knights,
 By you to be sustain'd, shall our abode
 Make with you by due turns. Only we still retain
 The name, and all th' additions to a king. The sway,
 Revenue, execution of the rest,
 Beloved sons, be yours; which to confirm,
 This coronet part betwixt you.
The bow is bent and drawn; make from the shaft.
Kent, on thy life, no more!
Out of my sight!
Now by Apollo-
O vassal! miscreant!
                               [Lays his hand on his sword.]
Hear me, recreant!
 On thine allegiance, hear me!
 Since thou hast sought to make us break our vow-
 Which we durst never yet- and with strain'd pride
 To come between our sentence and our power,-
 Which nor our nature nor our place can bear,-
 Our potency made good, take thy reward.
 Five days we do allot thee for provision
 To shield thee from diseases of the world,
 And on the sixth to turn thy hated back
 Upon our kingdom. If, on the tenth day following,
 Thy banish'd trunk be found in our dominions,
 The moment is thy death. Away! By Jupiter,
 This shall not be revok'd.
My Lord of Burgundy,
 We first address toward you, who with this king
 Hath rivall'd for our daughter. What in the least
 Will you require in present dower with her,
 Or cease your quest of love?
Right noble Burgundy,
 When she was dear to us, we did hold her so;
 But now her price is fall'n. Sir, there she stands.
 If aught within that little seeming substance,
 Or all of it, with our displeasure piec'd,
 And nothing more, may fitly like your Grace,
 She's there, and she is yours.
Will you, with those infirmities she owes,
 Unfriended, new adopted to our hate,
 Dow'r'd with our curse, and stranger'd with our oath,
 Take her, or leave her?
Then leave her, sir; for, by the pow'r that made me,
 I tell you all her wealth. [To France] For you, great King,
 I would not from your love make such a stray
 To match you where I hate; therefore beseech you
 T' avert your liking a more worthier way
 Than on a wretch whom nature is asham'd
 Almost t' acknowledge hers.
Better thou
 Hadst not been born than not t' have pleas'd me better.
Nothing! I have sworn; I am firm.
Thou hast her, France; let her be thine; for we
 Have no such daughter, nor shall ever see
 That face of hers again. Therefore be gone
 Without our grace, our love, our benison.
 Come, noble Burgundy.
         Flourish. Exeunt Lear, Burgundy, [Cornwall, Albany,
                                Gloucester, and Attendants].
Let me not stay a jot for dinner; go get it ready. [Exit
 an Attendant.] How now? What art thou?
What dost thou profess? What wouldst thou with us?
What art thou?
If thou be'st as poor for a subject as he's for a king, thou
 art poor enough. What wouldst thou?
Who wouldst thou serve?
Dost thou know me, fellow?
What's that?
What services canst thou do?
How old art thou?
Follow me; thou shalt serve me. If I like thee no worse after
 dinner, I will not part from thee yet. Dinner, ho, dinner!
 Where's my knave? my fool? Go you and call my fool hither.
                                        [Exit an attendant.]
                 Enter [Oswald the] Steward.
 You, you, sirrah, where's my daughter?
What says the fellow there? Call the clotpoll back.
 [Exit a Knight.] Where's my fool, ho? I think the world's
 asleep.
                        [Enter Knight]
 How now? Where's that mongrel?
Why came not the slave back to me when I call'd him?
He would not?
Ha! say'st thou so?
Thou but rememb'rest me of mine own conception. I have
 perceived a most faint neglect of late, which I have rather
 blamed as mine own jealous curiosity than as a very pretence
 and purpose of unkindness. I will look further into't. But
 where's my fool? I have not seen him this two days.
No more of that; I have noted it well. Go you and tell my
 daughter I would speak with her. [Exit Knight.] Go you, call
 hither my fool.
                                        [Exit an Attendant.]
                 Enter [Oswald the] Steward.
 O, you, sir, you! Come you hither, sir. Who am I, sir?
'My lady's father'? My lord's knave! You whoreson dog! you
 slave! you cur!
Do you bandy looks with me, you rascal?
                                              [Strikes him.]
I thank thee, fellow. Thou serv'st me, and I'll love thee.
Now, my friendly knave, I thank thee. There's earnest of thy
 service.                                     [Gives money.]
                         Enter Fool.
How now, my pretty knave? How dost thou?
Why, my boy?
Take heed, sirrah- the whip.
A pestilent gall to me!
Do.
Why, no, boy. Nothing can be made out of nothing.
A bitter fool!
No, lad; teach me.
Dost thou call me fool, boy?
What two crowns shall they be?
When were you wont to be so full of songs, sirrah?
An you lie, sirrah, we'll have you whipp'd.
How now, daughter? What makes that frontlet on? Methinks you
 are too much o' late i' th' frown.
Are you our daughter?
Doth any here know me? This is not Lear.
 Doth Lear walk thus? speak thus? Where are his eyes?
 Either his notion weakens, his discernings
 Are lethargied- Ha! waking? 'Tis not so!
 Who is it that can tell me who I am?
I would learn that; for, by the marks of sovereignty,
 Knowledge, and reason, I should be false persuaded
 I had daughters.
Your name, fair gentlewoman?
Darkness and devils!
 Saddle my horses! Call my train together!
 Degenerate bastard, I'll not trouble thee;
 Yet have I left a daughter.
Woe that too late repents!- O, sir, are you come?
 Is it your will? Speak, sir!- Prepare my horses.
 Ingratitude, thou marble-hearted fiend,
 More hideous when thou show'st thee in a child
 Than the sea-monster!
[to Goneril] Detested kite, thou liest!
 My train are men of choice and rarest parts,
 That all particulars of duty know
 And in the most exact regard support
 The worships of their name.- O most small fault,
 How ugly didst thou in Cordelia show!
 Which, like an engine, wrench'd my frame of nature
 From the fix'd place; drew from my heart all love
 And added to the gall. O Lear, Lear, Lear!
 Beat at this gate that let thy folly in  [Strikes his head.]
 And thy dear judgment out! Go, go, my people.
It may be so, my lord.
 Hear, Nature, hear! dear goddess, hear!
 Suspend thy purpose, if thou didst intend
 To make this creature fruitful.
 Into her womb convey sterility;
 Dry up in her the organs of increase;
 And from her derogate body never spring
 A babe to honour her! If she must teem,
 Create her child of spleen, that it may live
 And be a thwart disnatur'd torment to her.
 Let it stamp wrinkles in her brow of youth,
 With cadent tears fret channels in her cheeks,
 Turn all her mother's pains and benefits
 To laughter and contempt, that she may feel
 How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is
 To have a thankless child! Away, away!                Exit.
What, fifty of my followers at a clap?
 Within a fortnight?
I'll tell thee. [To Goneril] Life and death! I am asham'd
 That thou hast power to shake my manhood thus;
 That these hot tears, which break from me perforce,
 Should make thee worth them. Blasts and fogs upon thee!
 Th' untented woundings of a father's curse
 Pierce every sense about thee!- Old fond eyes,
 Beweep this cause again, I'll pluck ye out,
 And cast you, with the waters that you lose,
 To temper clay. Yea, is it come to this?
 Let it be so. Yet have I left a daughter,
 Who I am sure is kind and comfortable.
 When she shall hear this of thee, with her nails
 She'll flay thy wolvish visage. Thou shalt find
 That I'll resume the shape which thou dost think
 I have cast off for ever; thou shalt, I warrant thee.
                        Exeunt [Lear, Kent, and Attendants].
Go you before to Gloucester with these letters. Acquaint my
 daughter no further with anything you know than comes from her
 demand out of the letter. If your diligence be not speedy, I
 shall be there afore you.
Ay, boy.
Ha, ha, ha!
What canst tell, boy?
No.
I did her wrong.
No.
Why?
I will forget my nature. So kind a father!- Be my horses
 ready?
Because they are not eight?
To tak't again perforce! Monster ingratitude!
How's that?
O, let me not be mad, not mad, sweet heaven!
 Keep me in temper; I would not be mad!
                     [Enter a Gentleman.]
 How now? Are the horses ready?
Come, boy.
'Tis strange that they should so depart from home,
 And not send back my messenger.
Ha!
 Mak'st thou this shame thy pastime?
What's he that hath so much thy place mistook
 To set thee here?
No.
No, I say.
No, no, they would not!
By Jupiter, I swear no!
They durst not do't;
 They would not, could not do't. 'Tis worse than murther
 To do upon respect such violent outrage.
 Resolve me with all modest haste which way
 Thou mightst deserve or they impose this usage,
 Coming from us.
O, how this mother swells up toward my heart!
 Hysterica passio! Down, thou climbing sorrow!
 Thy element's below! Where is this daughter?
Follow me not;
 Stay here.                                            Exit.
Deny to speak with me? They are sick? they are weary?
 They have travell'd all the night? Mere fetches-
 The images of revolt and flying off!
 Fetch me a better answer.
Vengeance! plague! death! confusion!
 Fiery? What quality? Why, Gloucester, Gloucester,
 I'ld speak with the Duke of Cornwall and his wife.
Inform'd them? Dost thou understand me, man?
The King would speak with Cornwall; the dear father
 Would with his daughter speak, commands her service.
 Are they inform'd of this? My breath and blood!
 Fiery? the fiery Duke? Tell the hot Duke that-
 No, but not yet! May be he is not well.
 Infirmity doth still neglect all office
 Whereto our health is bound. We are not ourselves
 When nature, being oppress'd, commands the mind
 To suffer with the body. I'll forbear;
 And am fallen out with my more headier will,
 To take the indispos'd and sickly fit
 For the sound man.- Death on my state! Wherefore
 Should be sit here? This act persuades me
 That this remotion of the Duke and her
 Is practice only. Give me my servant forth.
 Go tell the Duke and 's wife I'ld speak with them-
 Now, presently. Bid them come forth and hear me,
 Or at their chamber door I'll beat the drum
 Till it cry sleep to death.
O me, my heart, my rising heart! But down!
Good morrow to you both.
Regan, I think you are; I know what reason
 I have to think so. If thou shouldst not be glad,
 I would divorce me from thy mother's tomb,
 Sepulchring an adultress. [To Kent] O, are you free?
 Some other time for that.- Beloved Regan,
 Thy sister's naught. O Regan, she hath tied
 Sharp-tooth'd unkindness, like a vulture, here!
                               [Lays his hand on his heart.]
 I can scarce speak to thee. Thou'lt not believe
 With how deprav'd a quality- O Regan!
Say, how is that?
My curses on her!
Ask her forgiveness?
 Do you but mark how this becomes the house:
 'Dear daughter, I confess that I am old.          [Kneels.]
 Age is unnecessary. On my knees I beg
 That you'll vouchsafe me raiment, bed, and food.'
[rises] Never, Regan!
 She hath abated me of half my train;
 Look'd black upon me; struck me with her tongue,
 Most serpent-like, upon the very heart.
 All the stor'd vengeances of heaven fall
 On her ingrateful top! Strike her young bones,
 You taking airs, with lameness!
You nimble lightnings, dart your blinding flames
 Into her scornful eyes! Infect her beauty,
 You fen-suck'd fogs, drawn by the pow'rful sun,
 To fall and blast her pride!
No, Regan, thou shalt never have my curse.
 Thy tender-hefted nature shall not give
 Thee o'er to harshness. Her eyes are fierce; but thine
 Do comfort, and not burn. 'Tis not in thee
 To grudge my pleasures, to cut off my train,
 To bandy hasty words, to scant my sizes,
 And, in conclusion, to oppose the bolt
 Against my coming in. Thou better know'st
 The offices of nature, bond of childhood,
 Effects of courtesy, dues of gratitude.
 Thy half o' th' kingdom hast thou not forgot,
 Wherein I thee endow'd.
Who put my man i' th' stocks?
This is a slave, whose easy-borrowed pride
 Dwells in the fickle grace of her he follows.
 Out, varlet, from my sight!
Who stock'd my servant? Regan, I have good hope
 Thou didst not know on't.- Who comes here? O heavens!
 If you do love old men, if your sweet sway
 Allow obedience- if yourselves are old,
 Make it your cause! Send down, and take my part!
 [To Goneril] Art not asham'd to look upon this beard?-
 O Regan, wilt thou take her by the hand?
O sides, you are too tough!
 Will you yet hold? How came my man i' th' stocks?
You? Did you?
Return to her, and fifty men dismiss'd?
 No, rather I abjure all roofs, and choose
 To wage against the enmity o' th' air,
 To be a comrade with the wolf and owl-
 Necessity's sharp pinch! Return with her?
 Why, the hot-blooded France, that dowerless took
 Our youngest born, I could as well be brought
 To knee his throne, and, squire-like, pension beg
 To keep base life afoot. Return with her?
 Persuade me rather to be slave and sumpter
 To this detested groom.                 [Points at Oswald.]
I prithee, daughter, do not make me mad.
 I will not trouble thee, my child; farewell.
 We'll no more meet, no more see one another.
 But yet thou art my flesh, my blood, my daughter;
 Or rather a disease that's in my flesh,
 Which I must needs call mine. Thou art a boil,
 A plague sore, an embossed carbuncle
 In my corrupted blood. But I'll not chide thee.
 Let shame come when it will, I do not call it.
 I do not bid the Thunder-bearer shoot
 Nor tell tales of thee to high-judging Jove.
 Mend when thou canst; be better at thy leisure;
 I can be patient, I can stay with Regan,
 I and my hundred knights.
Is this well spoken?
I gave you all-
Made you my guardians, my depositaries;
 But kept a reservation to be followed
 With such a number. What, must I come to you
 With five-and-twenty, Regan? Said you so?
Those wicked creatures yet do look well-favour'd
 When others are more wicked; not being the worst
 Stands in some rank of praise. [To Goneril] I'll go with thee.
 Thy fifty yet doth double five-and-twenty,
 And thou art twice her love.
O, reason not the need! Our basest beggars
 Are in the poorest thing superfluous.
 Allow not nature more than nature needs,
 Man's life is cheap as beast's. Thou art a lady:
 If only to go warm were gorgeous,
 Why, nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear'st
 Which scarcely keeps thee warm. But, for true need-
 You heavens, give me that patience, patience I need!
 You see me here, you gods, a poor old man,
 As full of grief as age; wretched in both.
 If it be you that stirs these daughters' hearts
 Against their father, fool me not so much
 To bear it tamely; touch me with noble anger,
 And let not women's weapons, water drops,
 Stain my man's cheeks! No, you unnatural hags!
 I will have such revenges on you both
 That all the world shall- I will do such things-
 What they are yet, I know not; but they shall be
 The terrors of the earth! You think I'll weep.
 No, I'll not weep.
 I have full cause of weeping, but this heart
 Shall break into a hundred thousand flaws
 Or ere I'll weep. O fool, I shall go mad!
          Exeunt Lear, Gloucester, Kent, and Fool. Storm and
                                                    tempest.
Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks! rage! blow!
 You cataracts and hurricanoes, spout
 Till you have drench'd our steeples, drown'd the cocks!
 You sulph'rous and thought-executing fires,
 Vaunt-couriers to oak-cleaving thunderbolts,
 Singe my white head! And thou, all-shaking thunder,
 Strike flat the thick rotundity o' th' world,
 Crack Nature's moulds, all germains spill at once,
 That makes ingrateful man!
Rumble thy bellyful! Spit, fire! spout, rain!
 Nor rain, wind, thunder, fire are my daughters.
 I tax not you, you elements, with unkindness.
 I never gave you kingdom, call'd you children,
 You owe me no subscription. Then let fall
 Your horrible pleasure. Here I stand your slave,
 A poor, infirm, weak, and despis'd old man.
 But yet I call you servile ministers,
 That will with two pernicious daughters join
 Your high-engender'd battles 'gainst a head
 So old and white as this! O! O! 'tis foul!
No, I will be the pattern of all patience;
 I will say nothing.
Let the great gods,
 That keep this dreadful pudder o'er our heads,
 Find out their enemies now. Tremble, thou wretch,
 That hast within thee undivulged crimes
 Unwhipp'd of justice. Hide thee, thou bloody hand;
 Thou perjur'd, and thou simular man of virtue
 That art incestuous. Caitiff, in pieces shake
 That under covert and convenient seeming
 Hast practis'd on man's life. Close pent-up guilts,
 Rive your concealing continents, and cry
 These dreadful summoners grace. I am a man
 More sinn'd against than sinning.
My wits begin to turn.
 Come on, my boy. How dost, my boy? Art cold?
 I am cold myself. Where is this straw, my fellow?
 The art of our necessities is strange,
 That can make vile things precious. Come, your hovel.
 Poor fool and knave, I have one part in my heart
 That's sorry yet for thee.
True, my good boy. Come, bring us to this hovel.
                                     Exeunt [Lear and Kent].
Let me alone.
Wilt break my heart?
Thou think'st 'tis much that this contentious storm
 Invades us to the skin. So 'tis to thee;
 But where the greater malady is fix'd,
 The lesser is scarce felt. Thou'dst shun a bear;
 But if thy flight lay toward the raging sea,
 Thou'dst meet the bear i' th' mouth. When the mind's free,
 The body's delicate. The tempest in my mind
 Doth from my senses take all feeling else
 Save what beats there. Filial ingratitude!
 Is it not as this mouth should tear this hand
 For lifting food to't? But I will punish home!
 No, I will weep no more. In such a night
 'To shut me out! Pour on; I will endure.
 In such a night as this! O Regan, Goneril!
 Your old kind father, whose frank heart gave all!
 O, that way madness lies; let me shun that!
 No more of that.
Prithee go in thyself; seek thine own ease.
 This tempest will not give me leave to ponder
 On things would hurt me more. But I'll go in.
 [To the Fool] In, boy; go first.- You houseless poverty-
 Nay, get thee in. I'll pray, and then I'll sleep.
                                                Exit [Fool].
 Poor naked wretches, wheresoe'er you are,
 That bide the pelting of this pitiless storm,
 How shall your houseless heads and unfed sides,
 Your loop'd and window'd raggedness, defend you
 From seasons such as these? O, I have ta'en
 Too little care of this! Take physic, pomp;
 Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel,
 That thou mayst shake the superflux to them
 And show the heavens more just.
Hast thou given all to thy two daughters, and art thou come
 to this?
What, have his daughters brought him to this pass?
 Couldst thou save nothing? Didst thou give 'em all?
Now all the plagues that in the pendulous air
 Hang fated o'er men's faults light on thy daughters!
Death, traitor! nothing could have subdu'd nature
 To such a lowness but his unkind daughters.
 Is it the fashion that discarded fathers
 Should have thus little mercy on their flesh?
 Judicious punishment! 'Twas this flesh begot
 Those pelican daughters.
What hast thou been?
Why, thou wert better in thy grave than to answer with thy
 uncover'd body this extremity of the skies. Is man no more than
 this? Consider him well. Thou ow'st the worm no silk, the beast
 no hide, the sheep no wool, the cat no perfume. Ha! Here's three
 on's are sophisticated! Thou art the thing itself;
 unaccommodated man is no more but such a poor, bare, forked
 animal as thou art. Off, off, you lendings! Come, unbutton
 here.
                                     [Tears at his clothes.]
What's he?
First let me talk with this philosopher.
 What is the cause of thunder?
I'll talk a word with this same learned Theban.
 What is your study?
Let me ask you one word in private.
O, cry you mercy, sir.
 Noble philosopher, your company.
Come, let's in all.
With him!
 I will keep still with my philosopher.
Come, good Athenian.
A king, a king!
To have a thousand with red burning spits
 Come hizzing in upon 'em-
It shall be done; I will arraign them straight.
 [To Edgar] Come, sit thou here, most learned justicer.
 [To the Fool] Thou, sapient sir, sit here. Now, you she-foxes!
I'll see their trial first. Bring in their evidence.
 [To Edgar] Thou, robed man of justice, take thy place.
 [To the Fool] And thou, his yokefellow of equity,
 Bench by his side. [To Kent] You are o' th' commission,
 Sit you too.
Arraign her first. 'Tis Goneril. I here take my oath before
 this honourable assembly, she kicked the poor King her father.
She cannot deny it.
And here's another, whose warp'd looks proclaim
 What store her heart is made on. Stop her there!
 Arms, arms! sword! fire! Corruption in the place!
 False justicer, why hast thou let her scape?
The little dogs and all,
 Tray, Blanch, and Sweetheart, see, they bark at me.
Then let them anatomize Regan. See what breeds about her
 heart. Is there any cause in nature that makes these hard
 hearts? [To Edgar] You, sir- I entertain you for one of my
 hundred; only I do not like the fashion of your garments. You'll
 say they are Persian attire; but let them be chang'd.
Make no noise, make no noise; draw the curtains.
 So, so, so. We'll go to supper i' th' morning. So, so, so.
No, they cannot touch me for coming;
 I am the King himself.
Nature 's above art in that respect. There's your press
 money. That fellow handles his bow like a crow-keeper. Draw me
 a clothier's yard. Look, look, a mouse! Peace, peace; this piece
 of toasted cheese will do't. There's my gauntlet; I'll prove it
 on a giant. Bring up the brown bills. O, well flown, bird! i'
 th' clout, i' th' clout! Hewgh! Give the word.
Pass.
Ha! Goneril with a white beard? They flatter'd me like a dog,
 and told me I had white hairs in my beard ere the black ones
 were there. To say 'ay' and 'no' to everything I said! 'Ay' and
 'no' too was no good divinity. When the rain came to wet me
 once, and the wind to make me chatter; when the thunder would
 not peace at my bidding; there I found 'em, there I smelt 'em
 out. Go to, they are not men o' their words! They told me I was
 everything. 'Tis a lie- I am not ague-proof.
Ay, every inch a king!
 When I do stare, see how the subject quakes.
 I pardon that man's life. What was thy cause?
 Adultery?
 Thou shalt not die. Die for adultery? No.
 The wren goes to't, and the small gilded fly
 Does lecher in my sight.
 Let copulation thrive; for Gloucester's bastard son
 Was kinder to his father than my daughters
 Got 'tween the lawful sheets.
 To't, luxury, pell-mell! for I lack soldiers.
 Behold yond simp'ring dame,
 Whose face between her forks presageth snow,
 That minces virtue, and does shake the head
 To hear of pleasure's name.
 The fitchew nor the soiled horse goes to't
 With a more riotous appetite.
 Down from the waist they are Centaurs,
 Though women all above.
 But to the girdle do the gods inherit,
 Beneath is all the fiend's.
 There's hell, there's darkness, there's the sulphurous pit;
 burning, scalding, stench, consumption. Fie, fie, fie! pah, pah!
 Give me an ounce of civet, good apothecary, to sweeten my
 imagination. There's money for thee.
Let me wipe it first; it smells of mortality.
I remember thine eyes well enough. Dost thou squiny at me?
 No, do thy worst, blind Cupid! I'll not love. Read thou this
 challenge; mark but the penning of it.
Read.
O, ho, are you there with me? No eyes in your head, nor no
 money in your purse? Your eyes are in a heavy case, your purse
 in a light. Yet you see how this world goes.
What, art mad? A man may see how the world goes with no eyes.
 Look with thine ears. See how yond justice rails upon yond
 simple thief. Hark in thine ear. Change places and, handy-dandy,
 which is the justice, which is the thief? Thou hast seen a
 farmer's dog bark at a beggar?
And the creature run from the cur? There thou mightst behold
 the great image of authority: a dog's obeyed in office.
 Thou rascal beadle, hold thy bloody hand!
 Why dost thou lash that whore? Strip thine own back.
 Thou hotly lusts to use her in that kind
 For which thou whip'st her. The usurer hangs the cozener.
 Through tatter'd clothes small vices do appear;
 Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,
 And the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks;
 Arm it in rags, a pygmy's straw does pierce it.
 None does offend, none- I say none! I'll able 'em.
 Take that of me, my friend, who have the power
 To seal th' accuser's lips. Get thee glass eyes
 And, like a scurvy politician, seem
 To see the things thou dost not. Now, now, now, now!
 Pull off my boots. Harder, harder! So.
If thou wilt weep my fortunes, take my eyes.
 I know thee well enough; thy name is Gloucester.
 Thou must be patient. We came crying hither;
 Thou know'st, the first time that we smell the air
 We wawl and cry. I will preach to thee. Mark.
When we are born, we cry that we are come
 To this great stage of fools. This' a good block.
 It were a delicate stratagem to shoe
 A troop of horse with felt. I'll put't in proof,
 And when I have stol'n upon these sons-in-law,
 Then kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!
             Enter a Gentleman [with Attendants].
No rescue? What, a prisoner? I am even
 The natural fool of fortune. Use me well;
 You shall have ransom. Let me have a surgeon;
 I am cut to th' brains.
No seconds? All myself?
 Why, this would make a man a man of salt,
 To use his eyes for garden waterpots,
 Ay, and laying autumn's dust.
I will die bravely, like a smug bridegroom. What!
 I will be jovial. Come, come, I am a king;
 My masters, know you that?
Then there's life in't. Nay, an you get it, you shall get it
 by running. Sa, sa, sa, sa!
                          Exit running. [Attendants follow.]
You do me wrong to take me out o' th' grave.
 Thou art a soul in bliss; but I am bound
 Upon a wheel of fire, that mine own tears
 Do scald like molten lead.
You are a spirit, I know. When did you die?
Where have I been? Where am I? Fair daylight,
 I am mightily abus'd. I should e'en die with pity,
 To see another thus. I know not what to say.
 I will not swear these are my hands. Let's see.
 I feel this pin prick. Would I were assur'd
 Of my condition!
Pray, do not mock me.
 I am a very foolish fond old man,
 Fourscore and upward, not an hour more nor less;
 And, to deal plainly,
 I fear I am not in my perfect mind.
 Methinks I should know you, and know this man;
 Yet I am doubtful; for I am mainly ignorant
 What place this is; and all the skill I have
 Remembers not these garments; nor I know not
 Where I did lodge last night. Do not laugh at me;
 For (as I am a man) I think this lady
 To be my child Cordelia.
Be your tears wet? Yes, faith. I pray weep not.
 If you have poison for me, I will drink it.
 I know you do not love me; for your sisters
 Have, as I do remember, done me wrong.
 You have some cause, they have not.
Am I in France?
Do not abuse me.
You must bear with me.
 Pray you now, forget and forgive. I am old and foolish.
                          Exeunt. Manent Kent and Gentleman.
No, no, no, no! Come, let's away to prison.
 We two alone will sing like birds i' th' cage.
 When thou dost ask me blessing, I'll kneel down
 And ask of thee forgiveness. So we'll live,
 And pray, and sing, and tell old tales, and laugh
 At gilded butterflies, and hear poor rogues
 Talk of court news; and we'll talk with them too-
 Who loses and who wins; who's in, who's out-
 And take upon 's the mystery of things,
 As if we were God's spies; and we'll wear out,
 In a wall'd prison, packs and sects of great ones
 That ebb and flow by th' moon.
Upon such sacrifices, my Cordelia,
 The gods themselves throw incense. Have I caught thee?
 He that parts us shall bring a brand from heaven
 And fire us hence like foxes. Wipe thine eyes.
 The goodyears shall devour 'em, flesh and fell,
 Ere they shall make us weep! We'll see 'em starv'd first.
 Come.                  Exeunt [Lear and Cordelia, guarded].
Howl, howl, howl, howl! O, you are men of stone.
 Had I your tongues and eyes, I'ld use them so
 That heaven's vault should crack. She's gone for ever!
 I know when one is dead, and when one lives.
 She's dead as earth. Lend me a looking glass.
 If that her breath will mist or stain the stone,
 Why, then she lives.
This feather stirs; she lives! If it be so,
 It is a chance which does redeem all sorrows
 That ever I have felt.
Prithee away!
A plague upon you, murderers, traitors all!
 I might have sav'd her; now she's gone for ever!
 Cordelia, Cordelia! stay a little. Ha!
 What is't thou say'st, Her voice was ever soft,
 Gentle, and low- an excellent thing in woman.
 I kill'd the slave that was a-hanging thee.
Did I not, fellow?
 I have seen the day, with my good biting falchion
 I would have made them skip. I am old now,
 And these same crosses spoil me. Who are you?
 Mine eyes are not o' th' best. I'll tell you straight.
This' a dull sight. Are you not Kent?
He's a good fellow, I can tell you that.
 He'll strike, and quickly too. He's dead and rotten.
I'll see that straight.
You're welcome hither.
Ay, so I think.
And my poor fool is hang'd! No, no, no life!
 Why should a dog, a horse, a rat, have life,
 And thou no breath at all? Thou'lt come no more,
 Never, never, never, never, never!
 Pray you undo this button. Thank you, sir.
 Do you see this? Look on her! look! her lips!
 Look there, look there!                            He dies.
