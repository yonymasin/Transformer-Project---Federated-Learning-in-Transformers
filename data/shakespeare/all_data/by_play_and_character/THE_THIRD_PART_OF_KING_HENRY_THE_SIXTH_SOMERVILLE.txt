At Southam I did leave him with his forces,
And do expect him here some two hours hence.
                                                [Drum heard]
It is not his, my lord; here Southam lies.
The drum your Honour hears marcheth from Warwick.
They are at hand, and you shall quickly know.
    March. Flourish. Enter KING EDWARD, GLOUCESTER,
                     and soldiers
