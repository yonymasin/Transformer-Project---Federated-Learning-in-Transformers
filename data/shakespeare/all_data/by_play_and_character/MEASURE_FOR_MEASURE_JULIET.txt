I do; and bear the shame most patiently.
I'll gladly learn.
Yes, as I love the woman that wrong'd him.
Mutually.
I do confess it, and repent it, father.
I do repent me as it is an evil,
And take the shame with joy.
Must die to-morrow! O, injurious law,
That respites me a life whose very comfort
Is still a dying horror!
