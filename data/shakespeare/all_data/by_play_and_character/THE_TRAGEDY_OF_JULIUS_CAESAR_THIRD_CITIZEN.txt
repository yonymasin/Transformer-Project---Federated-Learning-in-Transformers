The noble Brutus is ascended. Silence!
Let him be Caesar.
Let him go up into the public chair;
We'll hear him. Noble Antony, go up.
He says, for Brutus' sake,
He finds himself beholding to us all.
Nay, that's certain.
We are blest that Rome is rid of him.
Has he, masters?
I fear there will a worse come in his place.
There's not a nobler man in Rome than Antony.
You shall have leave.
O woeful day!
Away, then! Come, seek the conspirators.
O royal Caesar!
Pluck down benches.
Where do you dwell?
Ay, and truly, you were best.
Your name, sir, truly.
Tear him, tear him! Come, brands, ho, firebrands. To
Brutus', to Cassius'; burn all. Some to Decius' house, and some
to Casca's, some to Ligarius'. Away, go!             Exeunt.
