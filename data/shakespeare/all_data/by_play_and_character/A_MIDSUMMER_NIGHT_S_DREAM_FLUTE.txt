Here, Peter Quince.
What is Thisby? A wand'ring knight?
Nay, faith, let not me play a woman; I have a beard coming.
Must I speak now?
Most radiant Pyramus, most lily-white of hue,
Of colour like the red rose on triumphant brier,
Most brisky juvenal, and eke most lovely Jew,
As true as truest horse, that would never tire,
I'll meet thee, Pyramus, at Ninny's tomb.
O- As true as truest horse, that y et would never tire.
        Re-enter PUCK, and BOTTOM with an ass's head
If he come not, then the play is marr'd; it goes not
forward, doth it?
No; he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft man in
Athens.
You must say 'paragon.' A paramour is- God bless us!- A
thing of naught.
                       Enter SNUG
O sweet bully Bottom! Thus hath he lost sixpence a day
during his life; he could not have scaped sixpence a day. An the
Duke had not given him sixpence a day for playing Pyramus, I'll
be hanged. He would have deserved it: sixpence a day in Pyramus,
or nothing.
