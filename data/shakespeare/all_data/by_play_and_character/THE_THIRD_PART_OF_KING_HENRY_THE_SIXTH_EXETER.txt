But when the Duke is slain they'll quickly fly.
For shame, come down; he made thee Duke of York.
Thy father was a traitor to the crown.
No; for he could not so resign his crown
But that the next heir should succeed and reign.
His is the right, and therefore pardon me.
My conscience tells me he is lawful King.
They seek revenge, and therefore will not yield.
Accurs'd be he that seeks to make them foes!
                               [Sennet. Here they come down]
Here comes the Queen, whose looks bewray her anger.
I'll steal away.
And I, I hope, shall reconcile them all.        Exeunt
Away! for vengeance comes along with them.
Nay, stay not to expostulate; make speed;
Or else come after. I'll away before.
The doubt is that he will seduce the rest.
Hark, hark, my lord! What shouts are these?
        Enter KING EDWARD, GLOUCESTER, and soldiers
