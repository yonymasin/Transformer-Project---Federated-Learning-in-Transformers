It was, so please your Highness.
You made it known to us.
We are men, my liege.
And I another
So weary with disasters, tugg'd with fortune,
That I would set my life on any chance,
To mend it or be rid on't.
Though our lives-
But who did bid thee join with us?
Then stand with us.
The west yet glimmers with some streaks of day;
Now spurs the lated traveler apace
To gain the timely inn, and near approaches
The subject of our watch.
His horses go about.
Stand to't.
Let it come down.
                                       They set upon Banquo.
Wast not the way?
Well, let's away and say how much is done.
                                                     Exeunt.
Where is your husband?
He's a traitor.
What, you egg!
                                                  Stabs him.
Young fry of treachery!
