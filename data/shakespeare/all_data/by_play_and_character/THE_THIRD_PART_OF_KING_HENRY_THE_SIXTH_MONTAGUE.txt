And, brother, here's the Earl of Wiltshire's blood,
Whom I encount'red as the battles join'd.
Good brother, as thou lov'st and honourest arms,
Let's fight it out and not stand cavilling thus.
And I unto the sea, from whence I came.
                                         Exeunt the YORKISTS
But I have reasons strong and forcible.
                 Enter the DUKE OF YORK
Brother, I go; I'll win them, fear it not.
And thus most humbly I do take my leave.                Exit
          Enter SIR JOHN and SIR HUGH MORTIMER
Yet to have join'd with France in such alliance
Would more have strength'ned this our commonwealth
'Gainst foreign storms than any home-bred marriage.
But the safer when 'tis back'd with France.
So God help Montague as he proves true!
Comfort, my lord; and so I take my leave.
Montague, Montague, for Lancaster!
                          [He and his forces enter the city]
