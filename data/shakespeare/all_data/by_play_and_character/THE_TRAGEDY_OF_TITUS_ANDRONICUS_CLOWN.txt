Ho, the gibbet-maker? He says that he hath taken them down
again, for the man must not be hang'd till the next week.
Alas, sir, I know not Jupiter; I never drank with him in all
my life.
Ay, of my pigeons, sir; nothing else.
From heaven! Alas, sir, I never came there. God forbid I
should be so bold to press to heaven in my young days. Why, I am
going with my pigeons to the Tribunal Plebs, to take up a matter
of brawl betwixt my uncle and one of the Emperal's men.
Nay, truly, sir, I could never say grace in all my life.
Ay, sir.
I warrant you, sir; let me alone.
God be with you, sir; I will.
Yes, forsooth, an your mistriship be Emperial.
'Tis he.- God and Saint Stephen give you godden. I have
brought you a letter and a couple of pigeons here.
                               [SATURNINUS reads the letter]
How much money must I have?
Hang'd! by'r lady, then I have brought up a neck to a fair
end.                                          [Exit guarded]
