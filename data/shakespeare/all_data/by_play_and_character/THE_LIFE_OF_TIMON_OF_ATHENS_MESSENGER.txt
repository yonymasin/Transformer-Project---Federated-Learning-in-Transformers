Ay, my good lord. Five talents is his debt;
His means most short, his creditors most strait.
Your honourable letter he desires
To those have shut him up; which failing,
Periods his comfort.
Your lordship ever binds him.
All happiness to your honour!                  Exit
                  Enter an OLD ATHENIAN
'Tis Alcibiades, and some twenty horse,
All of companionship.
I have spoke the least.
Besides, his expedition promises
Present approach.
I met a courier, one mine ancient friend,
Whom, though in general part we were oppos'd,
Yet our old love had a particular force,
And made us speak like friends. This man was riding
From Alcibiades to Timon's cave
With letters of entreaty, which imported
His fellowship i' th' cause against your city,
In part for his sake mov'd.
           Enter the other SENATORS, from TIMON
