[Aside] And how his silence drinks up this applause!
You must prepare to fight without Achilles.
Or covetous of praise.
Or strange, or self-affected.
Be rul'd by him, Lord Ajax.
This shall I undertake; and 'tis a burden
Which I am proud to bear.
                                      Exeunt DIOMEDES and CALCHAS
       ACHILLES and PATROCLUS stand in their tent
That's my mind too. Good morrow, Lord Aeneas.
The one and other Diomed embraces.
Our bloods are now in calm; and so long health!
But when contention and occasion meet,
By Jove, I'll play the hunter for thy life
With all my force, pursuit, and policy.
We sympathise. Jove let Aeneas live,
If to my sword his fate be not the glory,
A thousand complete courses of the sun!
But in mine emulous honour let him die
With every joint a wound, and that to-morrow!
Both alike:
He merits well to have her that doth seek her,
Not making any scruple of her soilure,
With such a hell of pain and world of charge;
And you as well to keep her that defend her,
Not palating the taste of her dishonour,
With such a costly loss of wealth and friends.
He like a puling cuckold would drink up
The lees and dregs of a flat tamed piece;
You, like a lecher, out of whorish loins
Are pleas'd to breed out your inheritors.
Both merits pois'd, each weighs nor less nor more;
But he as he, the heavier for a whore.
She's bitter to her country. Hear me, Paris:
For every false drop in her bawdy veins
A Grecian's life hath sunk; for every scruple
Of her contaminated carrion weight
A Troyan hath been slain; since she could speak,
She hath not given so many good words breath
As for her Greeks and Troyans suff'red death.
Fair Lady Cressid,
So please you, save the thanks this prince expects.
The lustre in your eye, heaven in your cheek,
Pleads your fair usage; and to Diomed
You shall be mistress, and command him wholly.
O, be not mov'd, Prince Troilus.
Let me be privileg'd by my place and message
To be a speaker free: when I am hence
I'll answer to my lust. And know you, lord,
I'll nothing do on charge: to her own worth
She shall be priz'd. But that you say 'Be't so,'
I speak it in my spirit and honour, 'No.'
Even she.
Lady, a word. I'll bring you to your father.
                                               Exit with CRESSIDA
You must no more.
As Hector pleases.
'Tis Agamemnon's wish; and great Achilles
Doth long to see unarm'd the valiant Hector.
I cannot, lord; I have important business,
The tide whereof is now. Good night, great Hector.
What, are you up here, ho? Speak.
Diomed. Calchas, I think. Where's your daughter?
How now, my charge!
Will you remember?
Nay, but do, then;
And let your mind be coupled with your words.
Nay, then-
Fo, fo! come, tell a pin; you are a forsworn-
What did you swear you would bestow on me?
Good night.
No, no, good night; I'll be your fool no more.
And so, good night.
Fo, fo! adieu! you palter.
But will you, then?
Give me some token for the surety of it.
Whose was't?
I shall have it.
Ay, that.
I had your heart before; this follows it.
I will have this. Whose was it?
Come, tell me whose it was.
Whose was it?
To-morrow will I wear it on my helm,
And grieve his spirit that dares not challenge it.
Why, then farewell;
Thou never shalt mock Diomed again.
I do not like this fooling.
What, shall I come? The hour-
Farewell till then.
Thou dost miscall retire.
I do not fly; but advantageous care
Withdrew me from the odds of multitude.
Have at thee.
Go, go, my servant, take thou Troilus' horse;
Present the fair steed to my lady Cressid.
Fellow, commend my service to her beauty;
Tell her I have chastis'd the amorous Troyan,
And am her knight by proof.
Ay, there, there.
Troilus, I say! Where's Troilus?
I would correct him.
Ha! art thou there?
He is my prize. I will not look upon.
The bruit is Hector's slain, and by Achilles.
