My lord?
I will, my lord.                                Exit.
                     Enter Calpurnia.
They would not have you to stir forth today.
Plucking the entrails of an offering forth,
They could not find a heart within the beast.
Thus, Brutus, did my master bid me kneel,
Thus did Mark Antony bid me fall down,
And, being prostrate, thus he bade me say:
Brutus is noble, wise, valiant, and honest;
Caesar was mighty, bold, royal, and loving.
Say I love Brutus and I honor him;
Say I fear'd Caesar, honor'd him, and loved him.
If Brutus will vouchsafe that Antony
May safely come to him and be resolved
How Caesar hath deserved to lie in death,
Mark Antony shall not love Caesar dead
So well as Brutus living, but will follow
The fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus
Thorough the hazards of this untrod state
With all true faith. So says my master Antony.
I'll fetch him presently.                       Exit.
I do, Mark Antony.
He did receive his letters, and is coming,
And bid me say to you by word of mouth-
O Caesar!                                     Sees the body.
He lies tonight within seven leagues of Rome.
Sir, Octavius is already come to Rome.
He and Lepidus are at Caesar's house.
I heard him say Brutus and Cassius
Are rid like madmen through the gates of Rome.
