My Lord Constable, the armour that I saw in your tent
to-night- are those stars or suns upon it?
Who will go to hazard with me for twenty prisoners?
He longs to eat the English.
That island of England breeds very valiant creatures;
their mastiffs are of unmatchable courage.
What, will you have them weep our horses' blood?
How shall we then behold their natural tears?
                    Enter a MESSENGER
