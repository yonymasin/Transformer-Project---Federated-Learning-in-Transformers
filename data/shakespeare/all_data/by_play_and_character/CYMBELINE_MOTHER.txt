  Lucina lent not me her aid,
          But took me in my throes,
        That from me was Posthumus ripp'd,
          Came crying 'mongst his foes,
            A thing of pity.
  With marriage wherefore was he mock'd,
          To be exil'd and thrown
        From Leonati seat and cast
        From her his dearest one,
          Sweet Imogen?
  Since, Jupiter, our son is good,
          Take off his miseries.
