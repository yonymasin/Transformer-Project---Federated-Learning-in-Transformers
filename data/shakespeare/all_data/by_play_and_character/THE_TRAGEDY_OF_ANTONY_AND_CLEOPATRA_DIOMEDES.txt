Where's Antony?
Lives he?
Wilt thou not answer, man?                     Exit DERCETAS
Most absolute lord,
My mistress Cleopatra sent me to thee.
Now, my lord.
Lock'd in her monument. She had a prophesying fear
Of what hath come to pass; for when she saw-
Which never shall be found- you did suspect
She had dispos'd with Caesar, and that your rage
Would not be purg'd, she sent you word she was dead;
But fearing since how it might work, hath sent
Me to proclaim the truth; and I am come,
I dread, too late.
What, ho! the Emperor's guard! The guard, what ho!
Come, your lord calls!
         Enter four or five of the guard of ANTONY
His death's upon him, but not dead.
Look out o' th' other side your monument;
His guard have brought him thither.
        Enter, below, ANTONY, borne by the guard
