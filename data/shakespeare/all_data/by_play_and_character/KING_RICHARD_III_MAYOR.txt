God bless your Grace with health and happy days!
Had he done so?
Now, fair befall you! He deserv'd his death;
And your good Graces both have well proceeded
To warn false traitors from the like attempts.
I never look'd for better at his hands
After he once fell in with Mistress Shore.
But, my good lord, your Grace's words shall serve
As well as I had seen and heard him speak;
And do not doubt, right noble Princes both,
But I'll acquaint our duteous citizens
With all your just proceedings in this cause.
Marry, God defend his Grace should say us nay!
See where his Grace stands 'tween two clergymen!
Do, good my lord; your citizens entreat you.
God bless your Grace! We see it, and will say it.
