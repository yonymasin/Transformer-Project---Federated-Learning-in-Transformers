This is most strange,
 That she that even but now was your best object,
 The argument of your praise, balm of your age,
 Most best, most dearest, should in this trice of time
 Commit a thing so monstrous to dismantle
 So many folds of favour. Sure her offence
 Must be of such unnatural degree
 That monsters it, or your fore-vouch'd affection
 Fall'n into taint; which to believe of her
 Must be a faith that reason without miracle
 Should never plant in me.
Is it but this- a tardiness in nature
 Which often leaves the history unspoke
 That it intends to do? My Lord of Burgundy,
 What say you to the lady? Love's not love
 When it is mingled with regards that stands
 Aloof from th' entire point. Will you have her?
 She is herself a dowry.
Fairest Cordelia, that art most rich, being poor;
 Most choice, forsaken; and most lov'd, despis'd!
 Thee and thy virtues here I seize upon.
 Be it lawful I take up what's cast away.
 Gods, gods! 'tis strange that from their cold'st neglect
 My love should kindle to inflam'd respect.
 Thy dow'rless daughter, King, thrown to my chance,
 Is queen of us, of ours, and our fair France.
 Not all the dukes in wat'rish Burgundy
 Can buy this unpriz'd precious maid of me.
 Bid them farewell, Cordelia, though unkind.
 Thou losest here, a better where to find.
Bid farewell to your sisters.
Come, my fair Cordelia.
                                 Exeunt France and Cordelia.
