None, Brutus, none.
Live, Brutus, live, live!
Peace, ho! Let us hear him.
The will, the will! We will hear Caesar's will.
The will! The testament!
Come down.
Stand back; room, bear back!
Revenge! About! Seek! Burn! Fire! Kill!
Slay! Let not a traitor live!
We'll mutiny.
Peace, ho! Hear Antony, most noble Antony!
Most true, the will! Let's stay and hear the will.
Peace, ho!
