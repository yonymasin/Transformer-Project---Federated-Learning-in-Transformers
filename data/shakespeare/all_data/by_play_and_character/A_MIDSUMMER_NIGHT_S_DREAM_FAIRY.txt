     Over hill, over dale,
            Thorough bush, thorough brier,
          Over park, over pale,
            Thorough flood, thorough fire,
          I do wander every where,
          Swifter than the moon's sphere;
          And I serve the Fairy Queen,
          To dew her orbs upon the green.
          The cowslips tall her pensioners be;
          In their gold coats spots you see;
          Those be rubies, fairy favours,
          In those freckles live their savours.
I must go seek some dewdrops here,
And hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear.
Farewell, thou lob of spirits; I'll be gone.
Our Queen and all her elves come here anon.
Either I mistake your shape and making quite,
Or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite
Call'd Robin Goodfellow. Are not you he
That frights the maidens of the villagery,
Skim milk, and sometimes labour in the quern,
And bootless make the breathless housewife churn,
And sometime make the drink to bear no barm,
Mislead night-wanderers, laughing at their harm?
Those that Hobgoblin call you, and sweet Puck,
You do their work, and they shall have good luck.
Are not you he?
And here my mistress. Would that he were gone!
   Enter OBERON at one door, with his TRAIN, and TITANIA,
                    at another, with hers
