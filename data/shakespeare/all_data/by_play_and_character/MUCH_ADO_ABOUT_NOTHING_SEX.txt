Which be the malefactors?
But which are the offenders that are to be examined? let them
come before Master Constable.
Master Constable, you go not the way to examine. You must call
forth the watch that are their accusers.
What heard you him say else?
for accusing the Lady Hero wrongfully.
What else, fellow?
disgrace Hero before the whole assembly, and not marry her.
What else?
And this is more, masters, than you can deny. Prince John is
this morning secretly stol'n away. Hero was in this manner
accus'd, in this manner refus'd, and upon the grief of this
suddenly died. Master Constable, let these men be bound and
brought to Leonato's. I will go before and show him their
examination.                                         [Exit.]
