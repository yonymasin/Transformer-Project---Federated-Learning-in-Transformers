Four days will quickly steep themselves in night;
Four nights will quickly dream away the time;
And then the moon, like to a silver bow
New-bent in heaven, shall behold the night
Of our solemnities.
I was with Hercules and Cadmus once
When in a wood of Crete they bay'd the bear
With hounds of Sparta; never did I hear
Such gallant chiding, for, besides the groves,
The skies, the fountains, every region near
Seem'd all one mutual cry. I never heard
So musical a discord, such sweet thunder.
'Tis strange, my Theseus, that these lovers speak of.
But all the story of the night told over,
And all their minds transfigur'd so together,
More witnesseth than fancy's images,
And grows to something of great constancy,
But howsoever strange and admirable.
      Enter LYSANDER, DEMETRIUS, HERMIA, and HELENA
I love not to see wretchedness o'er-charged,
And duty in his service perishing.
He says they can do nothing in this kind.
Indeed he hath play'd on this prologue like a child on a
recorder- a sound, but not in government.
This is the silliest stuff that ever I heard.
It must be your imagination then, and not theirs.
I am aweary of this moon. Would he would change!
Well shone, Moon. Truly, the moon shines with a good
grace.            [The LION tears THISBY'S Mantle, and exit]
Beshrew my heart, but I pity the man.
How chance Moonshine is gone before Thisby comes back
and finds her lover?
                   Re-enter THISBY
Methinks she should not use a long one for such a
Pyramus; I hope she will be brief.
