Happy is your Grace,
That can translate the stubbornness of fortune
Into so quiet and so sweet a style.
   Under the greenwood tree
           Who loves to lie with me,
           And turn his merry note
           Unto the sweet bird's throat,
         Come hither, come hither, come hither.
           Here shall he see
           No enemy
         But winter and rough weather.
It will make you melancholy, Monsieur Jaques.
My voice is ragged; I know I cannot please you.
What you will, Monsieur Jaques.
More at your request than to please myself.
Well, I'll end the song. Sirs, cover the while; the Duke
will drink under this tree. He hath been all this day to look
you.
And I'll sing it.
What's that 'ducdame'?
And I'll go seek the Duke; his banquet is prepar'd.
                                            Exeunt severally
