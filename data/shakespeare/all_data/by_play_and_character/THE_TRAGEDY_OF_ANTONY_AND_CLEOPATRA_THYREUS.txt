Caesar, I go.
Caesar, I shall.                               Exeunt
                       SCENE XIII.
           Alexandria. CLEOPATRA'S palace
    Enter CLEOPATRA, ENOBARBUS, CHARMIAN, and IRAS
Hear it apart.
So, haply, are they friends to Antony.
So.
Thus then, thou most renown'd: Caesar entreats
Not to consider in what case thou stand'st
Further than he is Caesar.
He knows that you embrace not Antony
As you did love, but as you fear'd him.
The scars upon your honour, therefore, he
Does pity, as constrained blemishes,
Not as deserv'd.
Shall I say to Caesar
What you require of him? For he partly begs
To be desir'd to give. It much would please him
That of his fortunes you should make a staff
To lean upon. But it would warm his spirits
To hear from me you had left Antony,
And put yourself under his shroud,
The universal landlord.
My name is Thyreus.
'Tis your noblest course.
Wisdom and fortune combating together,
If that the former dare but what it can,
No chance may shake it. Give me grace to lay
My duty on your hand.
One that but performs
The bidding of the fullest man, and worthiest
To have command obey'd.
