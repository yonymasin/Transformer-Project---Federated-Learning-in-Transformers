[Aside] One of Lord Timon's men? A gift, I warrant. Why,
this hits right; I dreamt of a silver basin and ewer to-night-
Flaminius, honest Flaminius, you are very respectively welcome,
sir. Fill me some wine. [Exit SERVANT] And how does that
honourable, complete, freehearted gentleman of Athens, thy very
bountiful good lord and master?
I am right glad that his health is well, sir. And what
hast thou there under thy cloak, pretty Flaminius?
Flaminius, I have noted thee always wise. Here's to thee.
I have observed thee always for a towardly prompt spirit,
give thee thy due, and one that knows what belongs to reason, and
canst use the time well, if the time use thee well. Good parts in
thee. [To SERVANT] Get you gone, sirrah. [Exit SERVANT] Draw
nearer, honest Flaminius. Thy lord's a bountiful gentleman; but
thou art wise, and thou know'st well enough, although thou com'st
to me, that this is no time to lend money, especially upon bare
friendship without security. Here's three solidares for thee.
Good boy, wink at me, and say thou saw'st me not. Fare thee well.
Ha! Now I see thou art a fool, and fit for thy master.
