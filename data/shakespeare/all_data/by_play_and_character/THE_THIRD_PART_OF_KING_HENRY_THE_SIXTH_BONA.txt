Your grant or your denial shall be mine.
[To WARWICK] Yet I confess that often ere this day,
When I have heard your king's desert recounted,
Mine ear hath tempted judgment to desire.
Dear brother, how shall Bona be reveng'd
But by thy help to this distressed queen?
My quarrel and this English queen's are one.
Tell him, in hope he'll prove a widower shortly,
I'll wear the willow-garland for his sake.
