No more, thou thunder-master, show
          Thy spite on mortal flies.
        With Mars fall out, with Juno chide,
          That thy adulteries
            Rates and revenges.
        Hath my poor boy done aught but well,
          Whose face I never saw?
        I died whilst in the womb he stay'd
          Attending nature's law;
        Whose father then, as men report
          Thou orphans' father art,
        Thou shouldst have been, and shielded him
          From this earth-vexing smart.
Great Nature like his ancestry
          Moulded the stuff so fair
        That he deserv'd the praise o' th' world
          As great Sicilius' heir.
Why did you suffer Iachimo,
          Slight thing of Italy,
        To taint his nobler heart and brain
          With needless jealousy,
        And to become the geck and scorn
          O' th' other's villainy?
Thy crystal window ope; look out;
          No longer exercise
        Upon a valiant race thy harsh
          And potent injuries.
Peep through thy marble mansion. Help!
          Or we poor ghosts will cry
        To th' shining synod of the rest
          Against thy deity.
He came in thunder; his celestial breath
Was sulpherous to smell; the holy eagle
Stoop'd as to foot us. His ascension is
More sweet than our blest fields. His royal bird
Prunes the immortal wing, and cloys his beak,
As when his god is pleas'd.
The marble pavement closes, he is enter'd
His radiant roof. Away! and, to be blest,
Let us with care perform his great behest.   [GHOSTS vanish]
