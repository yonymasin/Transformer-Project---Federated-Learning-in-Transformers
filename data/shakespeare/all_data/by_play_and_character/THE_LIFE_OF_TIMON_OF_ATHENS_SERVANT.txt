Please you, my lord, there are certain ladies most
desirous of admittance.
There comes with them a forerunner, my lord, which bears
that office to signify their pleasures.
Here, my lord, in readiness.
My lord, there are certain nobles of the Senate newly
alighted and come to visit you.
I have told my lord of you; he is coming down to you.
Here's my lord.
Please your lordship, here is the wine.
My lord,
They have all been touch'd and found base metal, for
They have all denied him.
Excellent! Your lordship's a goodly villain. The devil
knew not what he did when he made man politic- he cross'd himself
by't; and I cannot think but, in the end, the villainies of man
will set him clear. How fairly this lord strives to appear foul!
Takes virtuous copies to be wicked, like those that under hot
ardent zeal would set whole realms on fire.
Of such a nature is his politic love.
This was my lord's best hope; now all are fled,
Save only the gods. Now his friends are dead,
Doors that were ne'er acquainted with their wards
Many a bounteous year must be employ'd
Now to guard sure their master.
And this is all a liberal course allows:
Who cannot keep his wealth must keep his house.         Exit
