The dinner is on the table; my father desires your
worships' company.
Will't please your worship to come in, sir?
The dinner attends you, sir.
I may not go in without your worship; they will not
sit till you come.
I pray you, sir, walk in.
I think there are, sir; I heard them talk'd of.
Ay, indeed, sir.
Not I, sir; pray you keep on.
I pray you, sir.
Alas, how then?
Gentle Master Fenton,
Yet seek my father's love; still seek it, sir.
If opportunity and humblest suit
Cannot attain it, why then-hark you hither.
                                       [They converse apart]
    Enter SHALLOW, SLENDER, and MISTRESS QUICKLY
I come to him.  [Aside]  This is my father's choice.
O, what a world of vile ill-favour'd faults
Looks handsome in three hundred pounds a year!
Good Master Shallow, let him woo for himself.
Now, Master Slender-
What is your will?
I mean, Master Slender, what would you with me?
Good mother, do not marry me to yond fool.
Alas, I had rather be set quick i' th' earth.
And bowl'd to death with turnips.
Pardon, good father. Good my mother, pardon.
