I am one, my liege,
Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world
Have so incensed that I am reckless what
I do to spite the world.
We shall, my lord,
Perform what you command us.
He needs not our mistrust, since he delivers
Our offices and what we have to do
To the direction just.
Then 'tis he; the rest
That are within the note of expectation
Already are i' the court.
A light, a light!
          Enter Banquo, and Fleance with a torch.
We have lost
Best half of our affair.
