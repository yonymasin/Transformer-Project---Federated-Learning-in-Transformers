I lost mine eye in laying the prize aboard,
[To SUFFOLK] And therefore, to revenge it, shalt thou die;
And so should these, if I might have my will.
And so am I: my name is Walter Whitmore.
How now! Why start'st thou? What, doth death affright?
Gualtier or Walter, which it is I care not:
Never yet did base dishonour blur our name
But with our sword we wip'd away the blot;
Therefore, when merchant-like I sell revenge,
Broke be my sword, my arms torn and defac'd,
And I proclaim'd a coward through the world.
The Duke of Suffolk muffled up in rags?
Speak, Captain, shall I stab the forlorn swain?
Come, Suffolk, I must waft thee to thy death.
Thou shalt have cause to fear before I leave thee.
What, are ye daunted now? Now will ye stoop?
There let his head and lifeless body lie,
Until the Queen his mistress bury it.                   Exit
