That labour may you save; see where he comes.
I do; and charge you in the Duke's name to obey me.
I do arrest you, sir; you hear the suit.
Good sir, be patient.
Good now, hold thy tongue.
Masters, let him go;
  He is my prisoner, and you shall not have him.
He is my prisoner; if I let him go,
  The debt he owes will be requir'd of me.
One Angelo, a goldsmith; do you know him?
Two hundred ducats.
Due for a chain your husband had of him.
Away, they'll kill us!
