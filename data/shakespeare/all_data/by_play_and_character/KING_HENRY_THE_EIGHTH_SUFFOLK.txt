How is the King employ'd?
No, his conscience
Has crept too near another lady.
Pray God he do! He'll never know himself else.
And free us from his slavery.
For me, my lords,
I love him not, nor fear him-there's my creed;
As I am made without him, so I'll stand,
If the King please; his curses and his blessings
Touch me alike; th' are breath I not believe in.
I knew him, and I know him; so I leave him
To him that made him proud-the Pope.
How sad he looks; sure, he is much afflicted.
 [Aside to NORFOLK]  Not to speak of!
I would not be so sick though for his place.
But this cannot continue.
 [Aside to NORFOLK]  I another.
                                       Exeunt NORFOLK and SUFFOLK
Which of the peers
Have uncontemn'd gone by him, or at least
Strangely neglected? When did he regard
The stamp of nobleness in any person
Out of himself?
Most Strangely.
The Cardinal's letters to the Pope miscarried,
And came to th' eye o' th' King; wherein was read
How that the Cardinal did entreat his Holiness
To stay the judgment o' th' divorce; for if
It did take place, 'I do' quoth he 'perceive
My king is tangled in affection to
A creature of the Queen's, Lady Anne Bullen.'
Believe it.
May you be happy in your wish, my lord!
For, I profess, you have it.
My amen to't!
There's order given for her coronation;
Marry, this is yet but young, and may be left
To some ears unrecounted. But, my lords,
She is a gallant creature, and complete
In mind and feature. I persuade me from her
Will fall some blessing to this land, which shall
In it be memoriz'd.
No, no;
There be moe wasps that buzz about his nose
Will make this sting the sooner. Cardinal Campeius
Is stol'n away to Rome; hath ta'en no leave;
Has left the cause o' th' King unhandled, and
Is posted, as the agent of our Cardinal,
To second all his plot. I do assure you
The King cried 'Ha!' at this.
He is return'd in his opinions; which
Have satisfied the King for his divorce,
Together with all famous colleges
Almost in Christendom. Shortly, I believe,
His second marriage shall be publish'd, and
Her coronation. Katharine no more
Shall be call'd queen, but princess dowager
And widow to Prince Arthur.
He has; and we shall see him
For it an archbishop.
'Tis so.
    Enter WOLSEY and CROMWELL
The Cardinal!
May be he hears the King
Does whet his anger to him.
The King, the King!
Who dares cross 'em,
Bearing the King's will from his mouth expressly?
Then, that without the knowledge
Either of King or Council, when you went
Ambassador to the Emperor, you made bold
To carry into Flanders the great seal.
That out of mere ambition you have caus'd
Your holy hat to be stamp'd on the King's coin.
Lord Cardinal, the King's further pleasure is-
Because all those things you have done of late,
By your power legatine within this kingdom,
Fall into th' compass of a praemunire-
That therefore such a writ be sued against you:
To forfeit all your goods, lands, tenements,
Chattels, and whatsoever, and to be
Out of the King's protection. This is my charge.
Sir, I did never win of you before.
God safely quit her of her burden, and
With gentle travail, to the gladding of
Your Highness with an heir!
I wish your Highness
A quiet night, and my good mistress will
Remember in my prayers.
Nay, my lord,
That cannot be; you are a councillor,
And by that virtue no man dare accuse you.
'Tis the right ring, by heav'n. I told ye all,
When we first put this dangerous stone a-rolling,
'Twould fall upon ourselves.
