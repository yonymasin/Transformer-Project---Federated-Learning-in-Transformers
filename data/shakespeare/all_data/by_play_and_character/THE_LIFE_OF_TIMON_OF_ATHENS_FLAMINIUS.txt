As you have said, my lord.          Exeunt SERVANTS
I thank you, sir.
                       Enter LUCULLUS
His health is well, sir.
Faith, nothing but an empty box, sir, which in my lord's

Unto his honour has my lord's meat in him;
Why should it thrive and turn to nutriment
When he is turn'd to poison?
O, may diseases only work upon't!
And when he's sick to death, let not that part of nature
Which my lord paid for be of any power
To expel sickness, but prolong his hour!                Exit

He goes away in a cloud. Call him, call him.
[Within] Servilius, help! My lord! my lord!
       Enter TIMON, in a rage, FLAMINIUS following
My lord-
