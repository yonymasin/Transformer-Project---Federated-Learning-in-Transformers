Save you, friend Cassio!
And I was going to your lodging, Cassio.
What, keep a week away? seven days and nights?
Eight score eight hours? and lovers' absent hours,
More tedious than the dial eight score times?
O weary reckoning!
                 O Cassio, whence came this?
This is some token from a newer friend.
To the felt absence now I feel a cause.
Is't come to this? Well, well.
                   Why, whose is it?
Leave you! wherefore?
                      Why, I pray you?
                         But that you do not love me.
I pray you, bring me on the way a little,
And say if I shall see you soon at night.
'Tis very good; I must be circumstanced.            Exeunt.
Let the devil and his dam haunt you! What did you mean by
that same handkerchief you gave me even now? I was a fine fool to
take it. I must take out the work? A likely piece of work that
you should find it in your chamber and not know who left it
there! This is some minx's token, and I must take out the work?
There, give it your hobbyhorse. Wheresoever you had it, I'll take
out no work on't.
An you'll come to supper tonight, you may; an you will not,
come when you are next prepared for.                        Exit.
What is the matter, ho? Who is't that cried?
O my dear Cassio, my sweet Cassio! O Cassio, Cassio,
 Cassio!
Alas, he faints! O Cassio, Cassio, Cassio!
He supp'd at my house; but I therefore shake not.
I am no strumpet, but of life as honest
As you that thus abuse me.
