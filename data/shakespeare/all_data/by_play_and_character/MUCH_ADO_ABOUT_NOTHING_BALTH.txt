Well, I would you did like me.
Which is one?
I love you the better. The hearers may cry Amen.
Amen.
No more words. The clerk is answered.
                                          [Takes her aside.]
O, good my lord, tax not so bad a voice
To slander music any more than once.
Because you talk of wooing, I will sing,
Since many a wooer doth commence his suit
To her he thinks not worthy, yet he wooes,
Yet will he swear he loves.
Note this before my notes:
There's not a note of mine that's worth the noting.
And an ill singer, my lord.
The best I can, my lord.
