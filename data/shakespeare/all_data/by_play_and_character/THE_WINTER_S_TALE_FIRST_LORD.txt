Behind the tuft of pines I met them; never
Saw I men scour so on their way. I ey'd them
Even to their ships.
By his great authority;
Which often hath no less prevail'd than so
On your command.
Beseech your Highness, call the Queen again.
For her, my lord,
I dare my life lay down- and will do't, sir,
Please you t' accept it- that the Queen is spotless
I' th' eyes of heaven and to you- I mean
In this which you accuse her.
Good my lord-
I had rather you did lack than I, my lord,
Upon this ground; and more it would content me
To have her honour true than your suspicion,
Be blam'd for't how you might.
Well done, my lord.
You must not enter.
Beseech your Highness, give us better credit.
We have always truly serv'd you; and beseech
So to esteem of us; and on our knees we beg,
As recompense of our dear services
Past and to come, that you do change this purpose,
Which being so horrible, so bloody, must
Lead on to some foul issue. We all kneel.
So please you, sir, their speed
Hath been beyond account.
This your request
Is altogether just. Therefore, bring forth,
And in Apollo's name, his oracle.
                                     Exeunt certain OFFICERS
What fit is this, good lady?
The higher pow'rs forbid!
Say no more;
Howe'er the business goes, you have made fault
I' th' boldness of your speech.
