Sir, I would advise you to shift a shirt; the violence
of action hath made you reek as a sacrifice. Where air comes out,
air comes in; there's none abroad so wholesome as that you vent.
Hurt him! His body's a passable carcass if he be not
hurt. It is a throughfare for steel if it be not hurt.
Stand you? You have land enough of your own; but he
added to your having, gave you some ground.
Sir, as I told you always, her beauty and her brain go
not together; she's a good sign, but I have seen small reflection
of her wit.
I'll attend your lordship.
What got he by that? You have broke his pate with your
bowl.
Did you hear of a stranger that's come to court
to-night?
There's an Italian come, and, 'tis thought, one of
Leonatus' friends.
One of your lordship's pages.
Your lordship is the most patient man in loss, the most
coldest that ever turn'd up ace.
But not every man patient after the noble temper of
your lordship. You are most hot and furious when you win.
Day, my lord.
