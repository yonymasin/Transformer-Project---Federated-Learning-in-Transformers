He's coming.
With old Menenius, and those senators
That always favour'd him.
I have; 'tis ready.
I have.
I shall inform them.
Very well.
List to your tribunes. Audience! peace, I say!
The people's enemy is gone, is gone!
                    [They all shout and throw up their caps]
Worthy tribunes,
There is a slave, whom we have put in prison,
Reports the Volsces with several powers
Are ent'red in the Roman territories,
And with the deepest malice of the war
Destroy what lies before 'em.
