The King, my lord, and Harry Prince of Wales
Are near at hand. The rest the paper tells. [Gives a letter]
At Basingstoke, my lord.
No; fifteen hundred foot, five hundred horse,
Are march'd up to my Lord of Lancaster,
Against Northumberland and the Archbishop.
I must wait upon my good lord here, I thank you, good Sir
John.
