Then she is well, and nothing can be ill.
Her body sleeps in Capel's monument,
And her immortal part with angels lives.
I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault
And presently took post to tell it you.
O, pardon me for bringing these ill news,
Since you did leave it for my office, sir.
I do beseech you, sir, have patience.
Your looks are pale and wild and do import
Some misadventure.
No, my good lord.
