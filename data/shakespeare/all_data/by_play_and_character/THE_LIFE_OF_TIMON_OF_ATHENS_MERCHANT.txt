O, 'tis a worthy lord!
A most incomparable man; breath'd, as it were,
To an untirable and continuate goodness.
He passes.
O, pray let's see't. For the Lord Timon, sir?
[Looking at the jewel] 'Tis a good form.
No, my good lord; he speaks the common tongue,
Which all men speak with him.
He'll spare none.
Ay, Apemantus.
If traffic do it, the gods do it.
