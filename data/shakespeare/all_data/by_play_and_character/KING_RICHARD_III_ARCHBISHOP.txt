Last night, I hear, they lay at Stony Stratford,
And at Northampton they do rest to-night;
To-morrow or next day they will be here.
And so no doubt he is, my gracious madam.
Good madam, be not angry with the child.
Here comes a messenger. What news?
For what offence?
 [To the QUEEN]  My gracious lady, go.
And thither bear your treasure and your goods.
For my part, I'll resign unto your Grace
The seal I keep; and so betide to me
As well I tender you and all of yours!
Go, I'll conduct you to the sanctuary.                Exeunt
