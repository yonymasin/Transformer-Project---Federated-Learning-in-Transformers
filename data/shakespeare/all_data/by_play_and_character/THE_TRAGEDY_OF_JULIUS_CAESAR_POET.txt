[Within.] Let me go in to see the generals.
There is some grudge between 'em, 'tis not meet
They be alone.
[Within.] Nothing but death shall stay me.
  Enter Poet, followed by Lucilius, Titinius, and Lucius.
For shame, you generals! What do you mean?
Love, and be friends, as two such men should be;
For I have seen more years, I'm sure, than ye.
