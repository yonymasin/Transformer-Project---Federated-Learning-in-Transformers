Sir, here's a woman would speak with you.
I had rather, forsooth, go before you like a man than
follow him like a dwarf.
Sir John Falstaff.
My Master Sir John is come in at your back-door,
Mistress Ford, and requests your company.
Ay, I'll be sworn. My master knows not of your
being here, and hath threat'ned to put me into everlasting
liberty, if I tell you of it; for he swears he'll turn me away.
 [Within]  Mistress Ford, Mistress Ford! here's
Mistress Page at the door, sweating and blowing and looking
wildly, and would needs speak with you presently.
