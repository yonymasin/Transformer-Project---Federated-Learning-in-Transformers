Whither away? To save myself by flight:
We are like to have the overthrow again.
Ay,
All the Talbots in the world, to save my life.          Exit
My gracious sovereign, as I rode from Calais,
To haste unto your coronation,
A letter was deliver'd to my hands,
Writ to your Grace from th' Duke of Burgundy.
