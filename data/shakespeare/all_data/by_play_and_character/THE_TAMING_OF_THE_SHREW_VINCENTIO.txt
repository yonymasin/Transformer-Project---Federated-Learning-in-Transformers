Fair sir, and you my merry mistress,
That with your strange encounter much amaz'd me,
My name is call'd Vincentio, my dwelling Pisa,
And bound I am to Padua, there to visit
A son of mine, which long I have not seen.
Lucentio, gentle sir.
But is this true; or is it else your pleasure,
Like pleasant travellers, to break a jest
Upon the company you overtake?
You shall not choose but drink before you go;
I think I shall command your welcome here,
And by all likelihood some cheer is toward.         [Knocks]
Is Signior Lucentio within, sir?
What if a man bring him a hundred pound or two to make
merry withal?
Art thou his father?
 [Seeing BIONDELLO]  Come hither, crack-hemp.
Come hither, you rogue. What, have you forgot me?
What, you notorious villain, didst thou never see thy
master's father, Vincentio?
Is't so, indeed?               [He beats BIONDELLO]
What am I, sir? Nay, what are you, sir? O immortal gods!
O fine villain! A silken doublet, a velvet hose, a scarlet cloak,
and a copatain hat! O, I am undone! I am undone! While I play the
good husband at home, my son and my servant spend all at the
university.
Thy father! O villain! he is a sailmaker in Bergamo.
His name! As if I knew not his name! I have brought him
up ever since he was three years old, and his name is Tranio.
Lucentio! O, he hath murd'red his master! Lay hold on
him, I charge you, in the Duke's name. O, my son, my son! Tell
me, thou villain, where is my son, Lucentio?
Carry me to the gaol!
Thus strangers may be hal'd and abus'd. O monstrous
villain!
      Re-enter BIONDELLO, with LUCENTIO and BIANCA
Lives my sweet son?
Where is that damned villain, Tranio,
That fac'd and brav'd me in this matter so?
I'll slit the villain's nose that would have sent me to
the gaol.
Fear not, Baptista; we will content you, go to; but I
will in to be revenged for this villainy.               Exit
Ay, mistress bride, hath that awakened you?
'Tis a good hearing when children are toward.
