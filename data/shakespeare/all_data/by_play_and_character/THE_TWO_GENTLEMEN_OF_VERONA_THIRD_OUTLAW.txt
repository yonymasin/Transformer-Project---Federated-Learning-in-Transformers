Stand, sir, and throw us that you have about ye;
If not, we'll make you sit, and rifle you.
Ay, by my beard, will we; for he is a proper man.
Have you long sojourn'd there?
By the bare scalp of Robin Hood's fat friar,
This fellow were a king for our wild faction!
Know, then, that some of us are gentlemen,
Such as the fury of ungovern'd youth
Thrust from the company of awful men;
Myself was from Verona banished
For practising to steal away a lady,
An heir, and near allied unto the Duke.
What say'st thou? Wilt thou be of our consort?
Say 'ay' and be the captain of us all.
We'll do thee homage, and be rul'd by thee,
Love thee as our commander and our king.
No, we detest such vile base practices.
Come, go with us; we'll bring thee to our crews,
And show thee all the treasure we have got;
Which, with ourselves, all rest at thy dispose.       Exeunt
