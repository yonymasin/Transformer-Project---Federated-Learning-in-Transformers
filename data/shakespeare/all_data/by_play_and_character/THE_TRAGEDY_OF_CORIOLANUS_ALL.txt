Speak, speak.
Resolv'd, resolv'd.
We know't, we know't.
No more talking on't; let it be done. Away, away!
Come, come.
The gods assist you!
Farewell.                                           Exeunt
To th' pot, I warrant him.             [Alarum continues]
                  Re-enter TITUS LARTIUS
Slain, sir, doubtless.
Caius Marcius Coriolanus!
Welcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus!
Content, content.                         Exeunt citizens
Amen, amen. God save thee, noble consul!
                                             Exeunt citizens
No, no; no man saw 'em.
Tribunes! patricians! citizens! What, ho! Sicinius!
Brutus! Coriolanus! Citizens!
Welcome, ladies, welcome!
                [A flourish with drums and trumpets. Exeunt]
