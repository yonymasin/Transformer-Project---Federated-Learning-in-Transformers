You spotted snakes with double tongue,
           Thorny hedgehogs, be not seen;
           Newts and blind-worms, do no wrong,
           Come not near our fairy Queen.
Hence away; now all is well.
           One aloof stand sentinel.          Exeunt FAIRIES
  Enter OBERON and squeezes the flower on TITANIA'S eyelids
