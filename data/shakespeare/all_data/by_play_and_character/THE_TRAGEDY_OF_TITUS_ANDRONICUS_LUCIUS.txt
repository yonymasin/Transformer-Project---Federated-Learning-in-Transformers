Give us the proudest prisoner of the Goths,
That we may hew his limbs, and on a pile
Ad manes fratrum sacrifice his flesh
Before this earthy prison of their bones,
That so the shadows be not unappeas'd,
Nor we disturb'd with prodigies on earth.
Away with him, and make a fire straight;
And with our swords, upon a pile of wood,
Let's hew his limbs till they be clean consum'd.
                            Exeunt TITUS' SONS, with ALARBUS
See, lord and father, how we have perform'd
Our Roman rites: Alarbus' limbs are lopp'd,
And entrails feed the sacrificing fire,
Whose smoke like incense doth perfume the sky.
Remaineth nought but to inter our brethren,
And with loud 'larums welcome them to Rome.
Proud Saturnine, interrupter of the good
That noble-minded Titus means to thee!
And that he will and shall, if Lucius live.
My lord, you are unjust, and more than so:
In wrongful quarrel you have slain your son.
Dead, if you will; but not to be his wife,
That is another's lawful promis'd love.                 Exit
But let us give him burial, as becomes;
Give Mutius burial with our bretheren.
Dear father, soul and substance of us all-
There lie thy bones, sweet Mutius, with thy friends,
Till we with trophies do adorn thy tomb.
We do, and vow to heaven and to his Highness
That what we did was mildly as we might,
Tend'ring our sister's honour and our own.
O noble father, you lament in vain;
The Tribunes hear you not, no man is by,
And you recount your sorrows to a stone.
My gracious lord, no tribune hears you speak.
To rescue my two brothers from their death;
For which attempt the judges have pronounc'd
My everlasting doom of banishment.
Ay me! this object kills me.
Speak, gentle sister, who hath martyr'd thee?
O, say thou for her, who hath done this deed?
Sweet father, cease your tears; for at your grief
See how my wretched sister sobs and weeps.
Ah, my Lavinia, I will wipe thy cheeks.
Stay, father! for that noble hand of thine,
That hath thrown down so many enemies,
Shall not be sent. My hand will serve the turn,
My youth can better spare my blood than you,
And therefore mine shall save my brothers' lives.
By heaven, it shall not go!
Sweet father, if I shall be thought thy son,
Let me redeem my brothers both from death.
Then I'll go fetch an axe.
Ah, that this sight should make so deep a wound,
And yet detested life not shrink thereat!
That ever death should let life bear his name,
Where life hath no more interest but to breathe!
                                      [LAVINIA kisses TITUS]
Farewell, Andronicus, my noble father,
The woefull'st man that ever liv'd in Rome.
Farewell, proud Rome; till Lucius come again,
He leaves his pledges dearer than his life.
Farewell, Lavinia, my noble sister;
O, would thou wert as thou tofore hast been!
But now nor Lucius nor Lavinia lives
But in oblivion and hateful griefs.
If Lucius live, he will requite your wrongs
And make proud Saturnine and his emperess
Beg at the gates like Tarquin and his queen.
Now will I to the Goths, and raise a pow'r
To be reveng'd on Rome and Saturnine.                   Exit
Approved warriors and my faithful friends,
I have received letters from great Rome
Which signifies what hate they bear their Emperor
And how desirous of our sight they are.
Therefore, great lords, be, as your titles witness,
Imperious and impatient of your wrongs;
And wherein Rome hath done you any scath,
Let him make treble satisfaction.
I humbly thank him, and I thank you all.
But who comes here, led by a lusty Goth?
 Enter a GOTH, leading AARON with his CHILD in his arms
O worthy Goth, this is the incarnate devil
That robb'd Andronicus of his good hand;
This is the pearl that pleas'd your Empress' eye;
And here's the base fruit of her burning lust.
Say, wall-ey'd slave, whither wouldst thou convey
This growing image of thy fiend-like face?
Why dost not speak? What, deaf? Not a word?
A halter, soldiers! Hang him on this tree,
And by his side his fruit of bastardy.
Too like the sire for ever being good.
First hang the child, that he may see it sprawl-
A sight to vex the father's soul withal.
Get me a ladder.
            [A ladder brought, which AARON is made to climb]
Say on; an if it please me which thou speak'st,
Thy child shall live, and I will see it nourish'd.
Tell on thy mind; I say thy child shall live.
Who should I swear by? Thou believest no god;
That granted, how canst thou believe an oath?
Even by my god I swear to thee I will.
O most insatiate and luxurious woman!
O detestable villain! Call'st thou that trimming?
O barbarous beastly villains like thyself!
Art thou not sorry for these heinous deeds?
Bring down the devil, for he must not die
So sweet a death as hanging presently.
Sirs, stop his mouth, and let him speak no more.
                   Enter AEMILIUS
Let him come near.
Welcome, Aemilius. What's the news from Rome?
Aemilius, let the Emperor give his pledges
Unto my father and my uncle Marcus.
And we will come. March away.                         Exeunt
Uncle Marcus, since 'tis my father's mind
That I repair to Rome, I am content.
FIRST GOTH. And ours with thine, befall what fortune will.
Good uncle, take you in this barbarous Moor,
This ravenous tiger, this accursed devil;
Let him receive no sust'nance, fetter him,
Till he be brought unto the Empress' face
For testimony of her foul proceedings.
And see the ambush of our friends be strong;
I fear the Emperor means no good to us.
Away, inhuman dog, unhallowed slave!
Sirs, help our uncle to convey him in.
                    Exeunt GOTHS with AARON. Flourish within
The trumpets show the Emperor is at hand.
        Sound trumpets. Enter SATURNINUS and
TAMORA, with AEMILIUS, TRIBUNES, SENATORS, and others
What boots it thee to can thyself a sun?
Can the son's eye behold his father bleed?
There's meed for meed, death for a deadly deed.
               [He stabs SATURNINUS. A great tumult. LUCIUS,
           MARCUS, and their friends go up into the balcony]
Then, gracious auditory, be it known to you
That Chiron and the damn'd Demetrius
Were they that murd'red our Emperor's brother;
And they it were that ravished our sister.
For their fell faults our brothers were beheaded,
Our father's tears despis'd, and basely cozen'd
Of that true hand that fought Rome's quarrel out
And sent her enemies unto the grave.
Lastly, myself unkindly banished,
The gates shut on me, and turn'd weeping out,
To beg relief among Rome's enemies;
Who drown'd their enmity in my true tears,
And op'd their arms to embrace me as a friend.
I am the turned forth, be it known to you,
That have preserv'd her welfare in my blood
And from her bosom took the enemy's point,
Sheathing the steel in my advent'rous body.
Alas! you know I am no vaunter, I;
My scars can witness, dumb although they are,
That my report is just and full of truth.
But, soft! methinks I do digress too much,
Citing my worthless praise. O, pardon me!
For when no friends are by, men praise themselves.
Thanks, gentle Romans! May I govern so
To heal Rome's harms and wipe away her woe!
But, gentle people, give me aim awhile,
For nature puts me to a heavy task.
Stand all aloof; but, uncle, draw you near
To shed obsequious tears upon this trunk.
O, take this warm kiss on thy pale cold lips.  [Kisses TITUS]
These sorrowful drops upon thy blood-stain'd face,
The last true duties of thy noble son!
Come hither, boy; come, come, come, and learn of us
To melt in showers. Thy grandsire lov'd thee well;
Many a time he danc'd thee on his knee,
Sung thee asleep, his loving breast thy pillow;
Many a story hath he told to thee,
And bid thee bear his pretty tales in mind
And talk of them when he was dead and gone.
Set him breast-deep in earth, and famish him;
There let him stand and rave and cry for food.
If any one relieves or pities him,
For the offence he dies. This is our doom.
Some stay to see him fast'ned in the earth.
Some loving friends convey the Emperor hence,
And give him burial in his father's grave.
My father and Lavinia shall forthwith
Be closed in our household's monument.
As for that ravenous tiger, Tamora,
No funeral rite, nor man in mourning weed,
No mournful bell shall ring her burial;
But throw her forth to beasts and birds to prey.
Her life was beastly and devoid of pity,
And being dead, let birds on her take pity.           Exeunt
