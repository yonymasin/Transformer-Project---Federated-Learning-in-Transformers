I promise you, I scarcely know myself.
Hear you the news abroad?
Ill news, by'r lady; seldom comes the
better.
I fear, I fear 'twill prove a giddy world.
                    Enter another CITIZEN
Ay, sir, it is too true; God help the while!
In him there is a hope of government,
Which, in his nonage, council under him,
And, in his full and ripened years, himself,
No doubt, shall then, and till then, govern well.
Truly, the hearts of men are fun of fear.
You cannot reason almost with a man
That looks not heavily and fun of dread.
Marry, we were sent for to the justices.
