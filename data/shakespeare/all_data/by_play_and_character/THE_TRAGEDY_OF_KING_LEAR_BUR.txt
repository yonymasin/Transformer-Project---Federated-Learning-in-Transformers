Most royal Majesty,
 I crave no more than hath your Highness offer'd,
 Nor will you tender less.
I know no answer.
Pardon me, royal sir.
 Election makes not up on such conditions.
Royal Lear,
 Give but that portion which yourself propos'd,
 And here I take Cordelia by the hand,
 Duchess of Burgundy.
I am sorry then you have so lost a father
 That you must lose a husband.
