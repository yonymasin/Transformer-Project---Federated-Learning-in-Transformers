If there be ten, shrink not, but down with 'em.
              Enter VALENTINE and SPEED
Peace! we'll hear him.
Whither travel you?
For what offence?
Have you the tongues?
Tell us this: have you anything to take to?
And I from Mantua, for a gentleman
Who, in my mood, I stabb'd unto the heart.
Indeed, because you are a banish'd man,
Therefore, above the rest, we parley to you.
Are you content to be our general-
To make a virtue of necessity,
And live as we do in this wilderness?
Thou shalt not live to brag what we have offer'd.
Come, bring her away.
Being nimble-footed, he hath outrun us,
But Moyses and Valerius follow him.
Go thou with her to the west end of the wood;
There is our captain; we'll follow him that's fled.
The thicket is beset; he cannot 'scape.
