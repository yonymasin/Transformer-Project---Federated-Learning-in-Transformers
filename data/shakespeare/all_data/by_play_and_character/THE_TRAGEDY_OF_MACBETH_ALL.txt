Paddock calls. Anon!
Fair is foul, and foul is fair.
Hover through the fog and filthy air.                Exeunt.
The weird sisters, hand in hand,
Posters of the sea and land,
Thus do go about, about,
Thrice to thine, and thrice to mine,
And thrice again, to make up nine.
Peace! The charm's wound up.
             Enter Macbeth and Banquo.
So all.
Well contented.
                       Exeunt all but Malcolm and Donalbain.
Double, double, toil and trouble;
Fire burn and cauldron bubble.
Double, double, toil and trouble;
Fire burn and cauldron bubble.
Double, double, toil and trouble;
Fire burn and cauldron bubble.
A deed without a name.
Come, high or low;
Thyself and office deftly show!
        Thunder. First Apparition: an armed Head.
Listen, but speak not to't.
Seek to know no more.
Show his eyes, and grieve his heart;
Come like shadows, so depart!
A show of eight Kings, the last with a glass in his hand;
               Banquo's Ghost following.
Hail, King of Scotland!                         Flourish.
