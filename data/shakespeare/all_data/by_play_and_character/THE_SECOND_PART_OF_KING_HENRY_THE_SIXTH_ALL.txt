[Kneeling] Long live Queen Margaret, England's happiness!
Come, let's be gone.                               Exeunt
God save your Majesty!
He hath confess'd. Away with him! He's a villain and a
traitor.
Ay, marry, will we; therefore get ye gone.
No, no; and therefore we'll have his head.
It shall be done.
O, brave!
                  Re-enter one with the heads
God save the King! God save the King!
We'll follow Cade, we'll follow Cade!
A Clifford! a Clifford! We'll follow the King and Clifford.
God save the King! God save the King!
