Caesar, 'tis his schoolmaster:
An argument that he is pluck'd, when hither
He sends so poor a pinion of his wing,
Which had superfluous kings for messengers
Not many moons gone by.
        Enter EUPHRONIUS, Ambassador from ANTONY
Caesar, I shall.                               Exit
         Enter DERCETAS With the sword of ANTONY
Proculeius,
What thou hast done thy master Caesar knows,
And he hath sent for thee. For the Queen,
I'll take her to my guard.
Most noble Empress, you have heard of me?
Assuredly you know me.
I understand not, madam.
If it might please ye-
Most sovereign creature-
Cleopatra-
Gentle madam, no.
Hear me, good madam.
Your loss is, as yourself, great; and you bear it
As answering to the weight. Would I might never
O'ertake pursu'd success, but I do feel,
By the rebound of yours, a grief that smites
My very heart at root.
I am loath to tell you what I would you knew.
Though he be honourable-
Madam, he will. I know't.                [Flourish]
                          [Within: 'Make way there-Caesar!']
   Enter CAESAR; GALLUS, PROCULEIUS, MAECENAS, SELEUCUS,
                 and others of his train
It is the Emperor, madam.        [CLEOPATPA kneels]
Where's the Queen?
Madam, as thereto sworn by your command,
Which my love makes religion to obey,
I tell you this: Caesar through Syria
Intends his journey, and within three days
You with your children will he send before.
Make your best use of this; I have perform'd
Your pleasure and my promise.
I your servant.
Adieu, good Queen; I must attend on Caesar.
How goes it here?
Caesar, thy thoughts
Touch their effects in this. Thyself art coming
To see perform'd the dreaded act which thou
So sought'st to hinder.
                  [Within: 'A way there, a way for Caesar!']
          Re-enter CAESAR and all his train
O sir, you are too sure an augurer:
That you did fear is done.
Who was last with them?
Here on her breast
There is a vent of blood, and something blown;
The like is on her arm.
