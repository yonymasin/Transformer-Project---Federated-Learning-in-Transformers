Chief master-gunner am I of this town;
Something I must do to procure me grace.
The Prince's espials have informed me
How the English, in the suburbs close intrench'd,
Wont, through a secret grate of iron bars
In yonder tower, to overpeer the city,
And thence discover how with most advantage
They may vex us with shot or with assault.
To intercept this inconvenience,
A piece of ordnance 'gainst it I have plac'd;
And even these three days have I watch'd
If I could see them. Now do thou watch,
For I can stay no longer.
If thou spy'st any, run and bring me word;
And thou shalt find me at the Governor's.               Exit
Father, I warrant you; take you no care;
I'll never trouble you, if I may spy them.              Exit
      Enter SALISBURY and TALBOT on the turrets, with
        SIR WILLIAM GLANSDALE, SIR THOMAS GARGRAVE,
                        and others
