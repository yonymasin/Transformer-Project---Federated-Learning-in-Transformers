When once he was mature for man,
          In Britain where was he
        That could stand up his parallel,
          Or fruitful object be
        In eye of Imogen, that best
          Could deem his dignity?
Like hardiment Posthumus hath
          To Cymbeline perform'd.
        Then, Jupiter, thou king of gods,
          Why hast thou thus adjourn'd
        The graces for his merits due,
          Being all to dolours turn'd?
