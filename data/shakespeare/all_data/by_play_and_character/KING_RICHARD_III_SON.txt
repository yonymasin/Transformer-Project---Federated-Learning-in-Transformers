Good grandam, tell us, is our father dead?
Why do you look on us, and shake your head,
And call us orphans, wretches, castaways,
If that our noble father were alive?
Then you conclude, my grandam, he is dead.
The King mine uncle is to blame for it.
God will revenge it; whom I will importune
With earnest prayers all to that effect.
Grandam, we can; for my good uncle Gloucester
Told me the King, provok'd to it by the Queen,
Devis'd impeachments to imprison him.
And when my uncle told me so, he wept,
And pitied me, and kindly kiss'd my cheek;
Bade me rely on him as on my father,
And he would love me dearly as a child.
Think you my uncle did dissemble, grandam?
I cannot think it. Hark! what noise is this?
        Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH, with her hair about her
            ears; RIVERS and DORSET after her
Ah, aunt, you wept not for our father's death!
How can we aid you with our kindred tears?
