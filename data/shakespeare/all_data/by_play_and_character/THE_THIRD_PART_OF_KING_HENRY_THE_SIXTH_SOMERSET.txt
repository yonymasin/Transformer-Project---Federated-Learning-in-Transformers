My lords, forbear this talk; here comes the King.
       Flourish. Enter KING EDWARD, attended; LADY
      GREY, as Queen; PEMBROKE, STAFFORD, HASTINGS,
  and others. Four stand on one side, and four on the other
What are they that fly there?
My liege, it is young Henry, Earl of Richmond.
My lord, I like not of this flight of Edward's;
For doubtless Burgundy will yield him help,
And we shall have more wars befor't be long.
As Henry's late presaging prophecy
Did glad my heart with hope of this young Richmond,
So doth my heart misgive me, in these conflicts,
What may befall him to his harm and ours.
Therefore, Lord Oxford, to prevent the worst,
Forthwith we'll send him hence to Brittany,
Till storms be past of civil enmity.
It shall be so; he shall to Brittany.
Come therefore, let's about it speedily.              Exeunt
Somerset, Somerset, for Lancaster!
                          [He and his forces enter the city]
Ah, Warwick, Warwick! wert thou as we are,
We might recover all our loss again.
The Queen from France hath brought a puissant power;
Even now we heard the news. Ah, couldst thou fly!
Ah, Warwick! Montague hath breath'd his last;
And to the latest gasp cried out for Warwick,
And said 'Commend me to my valiant brother.'
And more he would have said; and more he spoke,
Which sounded like a clamour in a vault,
That mought not be distinguish'd; but at last,
I well might hear, delivered with a groan,
'O farewell, Warwick!'
And he that will not fight for such a hope,
Go home to bed and, like the owl by day,
If he arise, be mock'd and wond'red at.
But he's deceiv'd; we are in readiness.
Nor I, but stoop with patience to my fortune.
                         Exeunt OXFORD and SOMERSET, guarded
