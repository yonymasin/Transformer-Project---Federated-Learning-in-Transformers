To help King Edward in his time of storm,
As every loyal subject ought to do.
Then fare you well, for I will hence again.
I came to serve a king and not a duke.
Drummer, strike up, and let us march away.
                                  [The drum begins to march]
What talk you of debating? In few words:
If you'll not here proclaim yourself our King,
I'll leave you to your fortune and be gone
To keep them back that come to succour you.
Why shall we fight, if you pretend no title?
Ay, now my sovereign speaketh like himself;
And now will I be Edward's champion.
And whoso'er gainsays King Edward's right,
By this I challenge him to single fight.
                                      [Throws down gauntlet]
