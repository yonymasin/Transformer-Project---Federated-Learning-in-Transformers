Thersites!
Thersites!
Dog!
Thou bitch-wolf's son, canst thou not hear? Feel, then.
                                                    [Strikes him]
Speak, then, thou whinid'st leaven, speak. I will beat thee
into handsomeness.
Toadstool, learn me the proclamation.
The proclamation!
Do not, porpentine, do not; my fingers itch.
I say, the proclamation.
Mistress Thersites!
Cobloaf!
You whoreson cur!                               [Strikes him]
Thou stool for a witch!
You dog!
You cur!                                        [Strikes him]
Therefore I beat thee.
O thou damned cur! I shall-
I bade the vile owl go learn me the tenour of the
proclamation, and he rails upon me.
Well, go to, go to.
I shall cut out your tongue.
Farewell. Who shall answer him?
O, meaning you! I will go learn more of it.            Exeunt
Yes, lion-sick, sick of proud heart. You may call it
melancholy, if you will favour the man; but, by my head, 'tis
pride. But why, why? Let him show us a cause. A word, my lord.
                                          [Takes AGAMEMNON aside]
What is he more than another?
Is he so much? Do you not think he thinks himself a better
man than I am?
Will you subscribe his thought and say he is?
Why should a man be proud? How doth pride grow? I know not
what pride is.
I do hate a proud man as I do hate the engend'ring of toads.
If I go to him, with my armed fist I'll pash him o'er the
face.
An 'a be proud with me I'll pheeze his pride.
Let me go to him.
A paltry, insolent fellow!
Can he not be sociable?
I'll let his humours blood.
An all men were a my mind-
'A should not bear it so, 'a should eat's words first.
Shall pride carry it?
I will knead him, I'll make him supple.
A whoreson dog, that shall palter with us thus!
Would he were a Troyan!
Shall I call you father?
How now, Patroclus?
Ha?
Ay, and good next day too.                               Exit
Thou, trumpet, there's my purse.
Now crack thy lungs and split thy brazen pipe;
Blow, villain, till thy sphered bias cheek
Out-swell the colic of puff Aquilon'd.
Come, stretch thy chest, and let thy eyes spout blood:
Thou blowest for Hector.                         [Trumpet sounds]
I am not warm yet; let us fight again.
I thank thee, Hector.
Thou art too gentle and too free a man.
I came to kill thee, cousin, and bear hence
A great addition earned in thy death.
If I might in entreaties find success,
As seld I have the chance, I would desire
My famous cousin to our Grecian tents.
Great Agamemnon comes to meet us here.
Do not chafe thee, cousin;
And you, Achilles, let these threats alone
Till accident or purpose bring you to't.
You may have every day enough of Hector,
If you have stomach. The general state, I fear,
Can scarce entreat you to be odd with him.
No, yonder 'tis;
There, where we see the lights.
No, not a whit.
                Re-enter ACHILLES
Troilus! thou coward Troilus!                            Exit
Troilus, thou coward Troilus, show thy head.
                 Enter DIOMEDES
What wouldst thou?
Were I the general, thou shouldst have my office
Ere that correction. Troilus, I say! What, Troilus!
                  Enter TROILUS
I'll fight with him alone. Stand, Diomed.
If it be so, yet bragless let it be;
Great Hector was as good a man as he.
