He says, my lord, your daughter is not well.
Sir, he answered me in the roundest manner, he would not.
My lord, I know not what the matter is; but to my judgment
 your Highness is not entertain'd with that ceremonious affection
 as you were wont. There's a great abatement of kindness appears
 as well in the general dependants as in the Duke himself also
 and your daughter.
I beseech you pardon me, my lord, if I be mistaken; for
 my duty cannot be silent when I think your Highness wrong'd.
Since my young lady's going into France, sir, the fool
 hath much pined away.
