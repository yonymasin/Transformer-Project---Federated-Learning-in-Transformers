Well met, Corporal Nym.
What, are Ancient Pistol and you friends yet?
I will bestow a breakfast to make you friends; and we'll
be all three sworn brothers to France. Let't be so, good Corporal
Nym.
It is certain, Corporal, that he is married to Nell
Quickly; and certainly she did you wrong, for you were
troth-plight to her.
Here comes Ancient Pistol and his wife. Good Corporal, be
patient here.
Good Lieutenant, good Corporal, offer nothing here.
Hear me, hear me what I say: he that strikes the first
stroke I'll run him up to the hilts, as I am a soldier.
                                                     [Draws]
Away, you rogue.
Come, shall I make you two friends? We must to France
together; why the devil should we keep knives to cut one
another's throats?
By this sword, he that makes the first thrust I'll kill
him; by this sword, I will.
Corporal Nym, an thou wilt be friends, be friends; an
thou wilt not, why then be enemies with me too. Prithee put up.
Would I were with him, wheresome'er he is, either in
heaven or in hell!
And of women.
Well, the fuel is gone that maintain'd that fire: that's
all the riches I got in his service.
Farewell, hostess.                     [Kissing her]
On, on, on, on, on! to the breach, to the breach!
