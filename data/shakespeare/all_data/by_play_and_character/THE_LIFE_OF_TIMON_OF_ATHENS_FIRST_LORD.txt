What time o' day is't, Apemantus?
That time serves still.
Hang thyself.
He's opposite to humanity. Come, shall we in
And taste Lord Timon's bounty? He outgoes
The very heart of kindness.
The noblest mind he carries
That ever govern'd man.
I'll keep you company.                      Exeunt
My lord, we always have confess'd it.
Might we but have that happiness, my lord, that you
would once use our hearts, whereby we might express some part of
our zeals, we should think ourselves for ever perfect.
You see, my lord, how ample y'are belov'd.
  Music. Re-enter CUPID, witb a Masque of LADIES as Amazons,
      with lutes in their hands, dancing and playing
Where be our men?
I am so far already in your gifts-
We are so virtuously bound-
The best of happiness, honour, and fortunes, keep with
you, Lord Timon!
The good time of day to you, sir.
Upon that were my thoughts tiring when we encount'red.
I hope it is not so low with him as he made it seem in the trial
of his several friends.
I should think so. He hath sent me an earnest inviting,
which many my near occasions did urge me to put off; but he hath
conjur'd me beyond them, and I must needs appear.
I am sick of that grief too, as I understand how all
things go.
A thousand pieces.
What of you?
Ever at the best, hearing well of your lordship.
I hope it remains not unkindly with your lordship that
I return'd you an empty messenger.
Royal cheer, I warrant you.
How do you? What's the news?
How? how?
How now, my lords!
He's but a mad lord, and nought but humours sways him.
He gave me a jewel th' other day, and now he has beat it out of
my hat. Did you see my jewel?
Let's make no stay.
