I beseech your Graces both to pardon me:
His Majesty hath straitly given in charge
That no man shall have private conference,
Of what degree soever, with your brother.
With this, my lord, myself have naught to do.
What one, my lord?
I do beseech your Grace to pardon me, and
withal
Forbear your conference with the noble Duke.
Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours,
Makes the night morning and the noontide night.
Princes have but their titles for their glories,
An outward honour for an inward toil;
And for unfelt imaginations
They often feel a world of restless cares,
So that between their tides and low name
There's nothing differs but the outward fame.
                  Enter the two MURDERERS
What wouldst thou, fellow, and how cam'st
thou hither?
What, so brief?
I am, in this, commanded to deliver
The noble Duke of Clarence to your hands.
I will not reason what is meant hereby,
Because I will be guiltless from the meaning.
There lies the Duke asleep; and there the keys.
I'll to the King and signify to him
That thus I have resign'd to you my charge.
Right well, dear madam. By your patience,
I may not suffer you to visit them.
The King hath strictly charg'd the contrary.
I mean the Lord Protector.
No, madam, no. I may not leave it so;
I am bound by oath, and therefore pardon me.            Exit
                     Enter STANLEY
