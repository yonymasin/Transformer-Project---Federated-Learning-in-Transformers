Never was monarch better fear'd and lov'd
Than is your Majesty. There's not, I think, a subject
That sits in heart-grief and uneasines
Under the sweet shade of your government.
So may your Highness, and yet punish too.
I one, my lord.
Your Highness bade me ask for it to-day.
I do confess my fault,
And do submit me to your Highness' mercy.
For me, the gold of France did not seduce,
Although I did admit it as a motive
The sooner to effect what I intended;
But God be thanked for prevention,
Which I in sufferance heartily will rejoice,
Beseeching God and you to pardon me.
