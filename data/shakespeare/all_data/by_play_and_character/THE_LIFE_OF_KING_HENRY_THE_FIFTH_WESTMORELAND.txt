Shall we call in th' ambassador, my liege?
They know your Grace hath cause and means and might-
So hath your Highness; never King of England
Had nobles richer and more loyal subjects,
Whose hearts have left their bodies here in England
And lie pavilion'd in the fields of France.
But there's a saying, very old and true:
      'If that you will France win,
      Then with Scotland first begin.'
For once the eagle England being in prey,
To her unguarded nest the weasel Scot
Comes sneaking, and so sucks her princely eggs,
Playing the mouse in absence of the cat,
To tear and havoc more than she can eat.
How smooth and even they do bear themselves,
As if allegiance in their bosoms sat,
Crowned with faith and constant loyalty!
Of fighting men they have full three-score thousand.
O that we now had here
But one ten thousand of those men in England
That do no work to-day!
Perish the man whose mind is backward now!
God's will, my liege! would you and I alone,
Without more help, could fight this royal battle!
The king hath granted every article:
His daughter first; and then in sequel, all,
According to their firm proposed natures.
