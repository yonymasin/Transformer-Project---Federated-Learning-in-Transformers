Fore God, his Grace is bold, to trust these traitors.
The King hath note of all that they intend,
By interception which they dream not of.
The King himself is rode to view their battle.
Farewell, good Salisbury; and good luck go with thee!
He is as full of valour as of kindness;
Princely in both.
                        Enter the KING
