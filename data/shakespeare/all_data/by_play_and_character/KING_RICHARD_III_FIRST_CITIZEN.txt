Good morrow, neighbour. Whither away so
fast?
Yes, that the King is dead.
Give you good morrow, sir.
No, no; by God's good grace, his son shall
reign.
So stood the state when Henry the Sixth
Was crown'd in Paris but at nine months old.
Why, so hath this, both by his father and
mother.
Come, come, we fear the worst; all will be
well.
