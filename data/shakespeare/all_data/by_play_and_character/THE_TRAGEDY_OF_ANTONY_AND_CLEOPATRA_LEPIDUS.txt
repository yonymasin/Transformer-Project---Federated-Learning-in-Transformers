I must not think there are
Evils enow to darken all his goodness.
His faults, in him, seem as the spots of heaven,
More fiery by night's blackness; hereditary
Rather than purchas'd; what he cannot change
Than what he chooses.
Here's more news.
'Tis pity of him.
To-morrow, Caesar,
I shall be furnish'd to inform you rightly
Both what by sea and land I can be able
To front this present time.
Farewell, my lord. What you shall know meantime
Of stirs abroad, I shall beseech you, sir,
To let me be partaker.
Good Enobarbus, 'tis a worthy deed,
And shall become you well, to entreat your captain
To soft and gentle speech.
'Tis not a time
For private stomaching.
But small to greater matters must give way.
Your speech is passion;
But pray you stir no embers up. Here comes
The noble Antony.
            Enter ANTONY and VENTIDIUS
Noble friends,
That which combin'd us was most great, and let not
A leaner action rend us. What's amiss,
May it be gently heard. When we debate
Our trivial difference loud, we do commit
Murder in healing wounds. Then, noble partners,
The rather for I earnestly beseech,
Touch you the sourest points with sweetest terms,
Nor curstness grow to th' matter.
Soft, Caesar!
'Tis noble spoken.
Worthily spoken, Maecenas.
Happily, amen!
Time calls upon's.
Of us must Pompey presently be sought,
Or else he seeks out us.
Noble Antony,
Not sickness should detain me.                    [Flourish]
                 Exeunt all but ENOBARBUS, AGRIPPA, MAECENAS
Trouble yourselves no further. Pray you hasten
Your generals after.
Till I shall see you in your soldier's dress,
Which will become you both, farewell.
Your way is shorter;
My purposes do draw me much about.
You'll win two days upon me.
Farewell.                                      Exeunt
Be pleas'd to tell us-
For this is from the present- how you take
The offers we have sent you.
Well met here.
Y'have strange serpents there.
Your serpent of Egypt is bred now of your mud by the
operation of your sun; so is your crocodile.
I am not so well as I should be, but I'll ne'er out.
Nay, certainly, I have heard the Ptolemies' pyramises are
very goodly things. Without contradiction I have heard that.
What manner o' thing is your crocodile?
What colour is it of?
'Tis a strange serpent.
Let all the number of the stars give light
To thy fair way!
