Go, ye giddy goose.
                                            The music plays.
Then should you be nothing but musical; for you are
altogether govern'd by humours. Lie still, ye thief, and hear the
lady sing in Welsh.
Wouldst thou have thy head broken?
Then be still.
Now God help thee!
What's that?
Not mine, in good sooth.
I will not sing.
