Fie, lords! that you, being supreme magistrates,
Thus contumeliously should break the peace!
Nought rests for me in this tumultuous strife
But to make open proclamation.
Come, officer, as loud as e'er thou canst,
Cry.
I'll call for clubs if you will not away.
This Cardinal's more haughty than the devil.
See the coast clear'd, and then we will depart.
Good God, these nobles should such stomachs bear!
I myself fight not once in forty year.                Exeunt
                           SCENE 4.
                    France. Before Orleans
           Enter, on the walls, the MASTER-GUNNER
                   OF ORLEANS and his BOY
besieg'd,
And how the English have the suburbs won.
O, my good lords, and virtuous Henry,
Pity the city of London, pity us!
The Bishop and the Duke of Gloucester's men,
Forbidden late to carry any weapon,
Have fill'd their pockets full of pebble stones
And, banding themselves in contrary parts,
Do pelt so fast at one another's pate
That many have their giddy brains knock'd out.
Our windows are broke down in every street,
And we for fear compell'd to shut our shops.
    Enter in skirmish, the retainers of GLOUCESTER and
           WINCHESTER, with bloody pates
