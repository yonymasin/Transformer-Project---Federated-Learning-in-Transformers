Holy Franciscan friar, brother, ho!
                  Enter Friar Laurence.
Going to find a barefoot brother out,
One of our order, to associate me
Here in this city visiting the sick,
And finding him, the searchers of the town,
Suspecting that we both were in a house
Where the infectious pestilence did reign,
Seal'd up the doors, and would not let us forth,
So that my speed to Mantua there was stay'd.
I could not send it- here it is again-
Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,
So fearful were they of infection.
Brother, I'll go and bring it thee.                 Exit.
