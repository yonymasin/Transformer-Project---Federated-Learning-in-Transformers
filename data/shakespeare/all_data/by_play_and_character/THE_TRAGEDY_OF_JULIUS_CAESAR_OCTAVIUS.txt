Your brother too must die; consent you, Lepidus?
Prick him down, Antony.
Or here, or at the Capitol.            Exit Lepidus.
So you thought him,
And took his voice who should be prick'd to die
In our black sentence and proscription.
You may do your will,
But he's a tried and valiant soldier.
Let us do so, for we are at the stake,
And bay'd about with many enemies;
And some that smile have in their hearts, I fear,
Millions of mischiefs.                               Exeunt.
Now, Antony, our hopes are answered.
You said the enemy would not come down,
But keep the hills and upper regions.
It proves not so. Their battles are at hand;
They mean to warn us at Philippi here,
Answering before we do demand of them.
Upon the right hand I, keep thou the left.
I do not cross you, but I will do so.
  March. Drum. Enter Brutus, Cassius, and their Army;
       Lucilius, Titinius, Messala, and others.
Mark Antony, shall we give sign of battle?
Stir not until the signal not until the signal.
Not that we love words better, as you do.
Come, come, the cause. If arguing make us sweat,
The proof of it will turn to redder drops.
Look,
I draw a sword against conspirators;
When think you that the sword goes up again?
Never, till Caesar's three and thirty wounds
Be well avenged, or till another Caesar
Have added slaughter to the sword of traitors.
So I hope,
I was not born to die on Brutus' sword.
Come, Antony, away!
Defiance, traitors, hurl we in your teeth.
If you dare fight today, come to the field;
If not, when you have stomachs.
                    Exeunt Octavius, Antony, and their Army.
What man is that?
All that served Brutus, I will entertain them.
Fellow, wilt thou bestow thy time with me?
Do so, good Messala.
According to his virtue let us use him
With all respect and rites of burial.
Within my tent his bones tonight shall lie,
Most like a soldier, ordered honorably.
So call the field to rest, and let's away,
To part the glories of this happy day.              Exeunt.
