[Aside] No, faith; not so much as his patience.
[Aside] His steel was in debt; it went o' th' back
side the town.
[Aside] No; but he fled forward still, toward your
face.
[Aside] As many inches as you have oceans.
Puppies!
[Aside] So would I, till you had measur'd how long a
fool you were upon the ground.
[Aside] If it be a sin to make a true election, she is
damn'd.
[Aside] She shines not upon fools, lest the reflection
should hurt her.
[Aside] I wish not so; unless it had been the fall of
an ass, which is no great hurt.
Well, my lord.                             Exeunt
[Aside] If his wit had been like him that broke it, it
would have run all out.
No, my lord; [Aside] nor crop the ears of them.
[Aside] To have smell'd like a fool.
[Aside] You are cock and capon too; and you crow,
cock, with your comb on.
It is not fit your lordship should undertake every
companion that you give offence to.
Ay, it is fit for your lordship only.
[Aside] He's a strange fellow himself, and knows it
not.
You cannot derogate, my lord.
[Aside] You are a fool granted; therefore your issues,
being foolish, do not derogate.
I'll attend your lordship.
                                Exeunt CLOTEN and FIRST LORD
That such a crafty devil as is his mother
Should yield the world this ass! A woman that
Bears all down with her brain; and this her son
Cannot take two from twenty, for his heart,
And leave eighteen. Alas, poor princess,
Thou divine Imogen, what thou endur'st,
Betwixt a father by thy step-dame govern'd,
A mother hourly coining plots, a wooer
More hateful than the foul expulsion is
Of thy dear husband, than that horrid act
Of the divorce he'd make! The heavens hold firm
The walls of thy dear honour, keep unshak'd
That temple, thy fair mind, that thou mayst stand
T' enjoy thy banish'd lord and this great land!         Exit
Here comes the King.
