Give me your hand, and let me feel your pulse.
I charge thee, Satan, hous'd within this man,
  To yield possession to my holy prayers,
  And to thy state of darkness hie thee straight.
  I conjure thee by all the saints in heaven.
It is no shame; the fellow finds his vein,
  And, yielding to him, humours well his frenzy.
Mistress, both man and master is possess'd;
  I know it by their pale and deadly looks.
  They must be bound, and laid in some dark room.
More company! The fiend is strong within him.

Enter three or four, and offer to bind him. He strives

Go bind this man, for he is frantic too.
[They bind DROMIO]
