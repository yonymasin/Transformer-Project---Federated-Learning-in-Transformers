Noble Aufidius,
Take your commission; hie you to your bands;
Let us alone to guard Corioli.
If they set down before's, for the remove
Bring up your army; but I think you'll find
Th' have not prepar'd for us.
Farewell.
Weapons, weapons, weapons!
                          [They all bustle about CORIOLANUS]
Get you gone.
