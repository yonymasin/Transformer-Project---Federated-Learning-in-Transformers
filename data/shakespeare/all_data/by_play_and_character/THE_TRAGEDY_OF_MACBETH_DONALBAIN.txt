What is amiss?
[Aside to Malcolm.] What should be spoken here, where
  our fate,
Hid in an auger hole, may rush and seize us?
Let's away,
Our tears are not yet brew'd.
To Ireland, I; our separated fortune
Shall keep us both the safer. Where we are
There's daggers in men's smiles; the near in blood,
The nearer bloody.
