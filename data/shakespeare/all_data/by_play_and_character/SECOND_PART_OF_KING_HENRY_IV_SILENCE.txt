Good morrow, good cousin Shallow.
Alas, a black ousel, cousin Shallow!
Indeed, sir, to my cost.
You were call'd 'lusty Shallow' then, cousin.
This Sir John, cousin, that comes hither anon about
soldiers?
We shall all follow, cousin.
By my troth, I was not there.
Dead, sir.
Thereafter as they be- a score of good ewes may be worth
ten pounds.
Here come two of Sir John Falstaffs men, as I think.
Your good worship is welcome.
That's fifty-five year ago.
Ah, sirrah! quoth-a- we shall               [Singing]
          Do nothing but eat and make good cheer,
          And praise God for the merry year;
          When flesh is cheap and females dear,
          And lusty lads roam here and there,
              So merrily,
            And ever among so merrily.
 [Singing]
     Be merry, be merry, my wife has all;
     For women are shrews, both short and tall;
     'Tis merry in hall when beards wag an;
       And welcome merry Shrove-tide.
     Be merry, be merry.
Who, I? I have been merry twice and once ere now.
                      Re-enter DAVY
 [Singing]
     A cup of wine that's brisk and fine,
     And drink unto the leman mine;
       And a merry heart lives long-a.
An we shall be merry, now comes in the sweet o' th' night.
 [Singing]
     Fill the cup, and let it come,
     I'll pledge you a mile to th' bottom.
 [Singing]
     Do me right,
     And dub me knight.
       Samingo.
Is't not so?
Is't so? Why then, say an old man can do somewhat.
                    Re-enter DAVY
By'r lady, I think 'a be, but goodman Puff of Barson.
 [Singing]  And Robin Hood, Scarlet, and John.
