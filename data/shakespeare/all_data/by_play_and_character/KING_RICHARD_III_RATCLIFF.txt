Dispatch; the limit of your lives is out.
Make haste; the hour of death is expiate.
Come, come, dispatch; the Duke would be at
dinner.
Make a short shrift; he longs to see your head.
My lord!
Bad news, my lord: Morton is fled to Richmond;
And Buckingham, back'd with the hardy Welshmen,
Is in the field, and still his power increaseth.
Most mighty sovereign, on the western coast
Rideth a puissant navy; to our shores
Throng many doubtful hollow-hearted friends,
Unarm'd, and unresolv'd to beat them back.
'Tis thought that Richmond is their admiral;
And there they hull, expecting but the aid
Of Buckingham to welcome them ashore.
What, may it please you, shall I do at Salisbury?
Your Highness told me I should post before.
My lord?
Thomas the Earl of Surrey and himself,
Much about cock-shut time, from troop to troop
Went through the army, cheering up the soldiers.
It is, my lord.
My lord!
Ratcliff, my lord; 'tis I. The early village-cock
Hath twice done salutation to the morn;
Your friends are up and buckle on their armour.
No doubt, my lord.
Nay, good my lord, be not afraid of shadows.
Have stuck more terror to the soul of Richard
Than can the substance of ten thousand soldiers
Armed in proof and led by shallow Richmond.
'Tis not yet near day. Come, go with me;
Under our tents I'll play the eaves-dropper,
To see if any mean to shrink from me.                 Exeunt
      Enter the LORDS to RICHMOND sitting in his tent
That he was never trained up in arms.
He smil'd, and said 'The better for our purpose.'
                                             [Clock strikes]
Tell the clock there. Give me a calendar.
Who saw the sun to-day?
Not I, my lord.
My lord?
