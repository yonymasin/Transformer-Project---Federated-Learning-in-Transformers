'Tis better, sir, than to be tedious. Let
him see our commission and talk no more.
                                       [BRAKENBURY reads it]
What, shall I stab him as he sleeps?
Why, he shall never wake until the great
judgment-day.
The urging of that word judgment hath
bred a kind of remorse in me.
Not to kill him, having a warrant; but to
be damn'd for killing him, from the which no warrant can
defend me.
So I am, to let him live.
Nay, I prithee, stay a little. I hope this
passionate humour of mine will change; it was wont to
hold me but while one tells twenty.
Zounds, he dies; I had forgot the reward.
O, in the Duke of Gloucester's purse!
'Tis no matter; let it go; there's few or
none will entertain it.
I'll not meddle with it-it makes a man
coward: a man cannot steal, but it accuseth him; a man
cannot swear, but it checks him; a man cannot lie with his
neighbour's wife, but it detects him. 'Tis a blushing shame-
fac'd spirit that mutinies in a man's bosom; it fills a man
full of obstacles: it made me once restore a purse of gold
that-by chance I found. It beggars any man that keeps it.
It is turn'd out of towns and cities for a dangerous thing;
and every man that means to live well endeavours to trust
to himself and live without it.
Take the devil in thy mind and believe
him not; he would insinuate with thee but to make the
sigh.
Spoke like a tall man that respects thy
reputation. Come, shall we fall to work?
O excellent device! and make a sop of
him.
Strike!
You shall have wine enough, my lord,
anon.
Nor you as we are, loyal.
To, to, to-
Never, my lord; therefore prepare to die.
And he that hath commanded is our
King.
And that same vengeance doth he hurl
on thee
For false forswearing, and for murder too;
Thou didst receive the sacrament to fight
In quarrel of the house of Lancaster.
Whom thou wast sworn to cherish and
defend.
You are deceiv'd: your brother Gloucester
hates you.
Make peace with God, for you must die,
my lord.
What shall we do?
Look behind you, my lord.
A bloody deed, and desperately
dispatch'd!
How fain, like Pilate, would I wash my hands
Of this most grievous murder!
                   Re-enter FIRST MURDERER
help'st me not?
By heavens, the Duke shall know how slack you have
been!
I would he knew that I had sav'd his
brother!
Take thou the fee, and tell him what I say;
For I repent me that the Duke is slain.                 Exit
