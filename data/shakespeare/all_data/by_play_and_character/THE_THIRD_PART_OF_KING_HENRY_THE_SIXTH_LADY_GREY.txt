Right gracious lord, I cannot brook delay.
May it please your Highness to resolve me now;
And what your pleasure is shall satisfy me.
Three, my most gracious lord.
Be pitiful, dread lord, and grant it, then.
Ay, full as dearly as I love myself.
To do them good I would sustain some harm.
Therefore I came unto your Majesty.
So shall you bind me to your Highness' service.
What you command that rests in me to do.
No, gracious lord, except I cannot do it.
Why, then I will do what your Grace commands.
Why stops my lord? Shall I not hear my task?
That's soon perform'd, because I am a subject.
I take my leave with many thousand thanks.
The fruits of love I mean, my loving liege.
My love till death, my humble thanks, my prayers;
That love which virtue begs and virtue grants.
Why, then you mean not as I thought you did.
My mind will never grant what I perceive
Your Highness aims at, if I aim aright.
To tell you plain, I had rather lie in prison.
Why, then mine honesty shall be my dower;
For by that loss I will not purchase them.
Herein your Highness wrongs both them and me.
But, mighty lord, this merry inclination
Accords not with the sadness of my suit.
Please you dismiss me, either with ay or no.
Then, no, my lord. My suit is at an end.
'Tis better said than done, my gracious lord.
I am a subject fit to jest withal,
But far unfit to be a sovereign.
And that is more than I will yield unto.
I know I am too mean to be your queen,
And yet too good to be your concubine.
'Twill grieve your Grace my sons should call you father.
Thou art a widow, and thou hast some children;
And, by God's Mother, I, being but a bachelor,
Have other some. Why, 'tis a happy thing
To be the father unto many sons.
Answer no more, for thou shalt be my queen.
