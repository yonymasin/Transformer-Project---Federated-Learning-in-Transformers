A segregation of the Turkish fleet.
For do but stand upon the foaming shore,
The chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds;
The wind-shaked surge, with high and monstrous mane,
Seems to cast water on the burning bear,
And quench the guards of the ever-fixed pole.
I never did like molestation view
On the enchafed flood.
They do discharge their shot of courtesy-
Our friends at least.
I shall.                                    Exit.
'Tis one Iago, ancient to the general.
They give their greeting to the citadel;
This likewise is a friend.
