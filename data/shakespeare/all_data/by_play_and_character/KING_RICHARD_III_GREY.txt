In that you brook it ill, it makes him worse;
Therefore, for God's sake, entertain good comfort,
And cheer his Grace with quick and merry eyes.
No other harm but loss of such a lord.
The heavens have bless'd you with a goodly son
To be your comforter when he is gone.
Here come the Lords of Buckingham and Derby.
To who in all this presence speaks your Grace?
God bless the Prince from all the pack of you!
A knot you are of damned blood-suckers.
Now Margaret's curse is fall'n upon our heads,
When she exclaim'd on Hastings, you, and I,
For standing by when Richard stabb'd her son.
