When the hurlyburly's done,
When the battle's lost and won.
Upon the heath.
Killing swine.
I'll give thee a wind.
Show me, show me.
All hail, Macbeth, hail to thee, Thane of Cawdor!
Hail!
Not so happy, yet much happier.
Thrice and once the hedge-pig whined.
Fillet of a fenny snake,
In the cauldron boil and bake;
Eye of newt and toe of frog,
Wool of bat and tongue of dog,
Adder's fork and blind-worm's sting,
Lizard's leg and howlet's wing,
For a charm of powerful trouble,
Like a hell-broth boil and bubble.
Cool it with a baboon's blood,
Then the charm is firm and good.
        Enter Hecate to the other three Witches.
By the pricking of my thumbs,
Something wicked this way comes.
Open, locks,
Whoever knocks!
                  Enter Macbeth.
Demand.
Show!
