Find them out whose names are written here? It is written
that the shoemaker should meddle with his yard and the tailor
with his last, the fisher with his pencil and the painter with
his nets; but I am sent to find those persons whose names are
here writ, and can never find what names the writing person hath
here writ. I must to the learned. In good time!
               Enter Benvolio and Romeo.
God gi' go-den. I pray, sir, can you read?
Perhaps you have learned it without book. But I pray, can you
read anything you see?
Ye say honestly. Rest you merry!
Up.
To supper, to our house.
My master's.
Now I'll tell you without asking. My master is the great rich
Capulet; and if you be not of the house of Montagues, I pray come
and crush a cup of wine. Rest you merry!               Exit.
Madam, the guests are come, supper serv'd up, you call'd, my
young lady ask'd for, the nurse curs'd in the pantry, and
everything in extremity. I must hence to wait. I beseech you
follow straight.
I know not, sir.
You shall have none ill, sir; for I'll try if they can lick
their fingers.
Marry, sir, 'tis an ill cook that cannot lick his own
fingers. Therefore he that cannot lick his fingers goes not with
me.
