Master Hume, we are therefore provided; will her
ladyship behold and hear our exorcisms?
I have heard her reported to be a woman of an
invincible spirit; but it shall be convenient, Master Hume, that
you be by her aloft while we be busy below; and so I pray you go,
in God's name, and leave us. [Exit HUME] Mother Jourdain, be you
prostrate and grovel on the earth; John Southwell, read you; and
let us to our work.
             Enter DUCHESS aloft, followed by HUME
Patience, good lady; wizards know their times:
Deep night, dark night, the silent of the night,
The time of night when Troy was set on fire;
The time when screech-owls cry and ban-dogs howl,
And spirits walk and ghosts break up their graves-
That time best fits the work we have in hand.
Madam, sit you, and fear not: whom we raise
We will make fast within a hallow'd verge.
 [Here they do the ceremonies belonging, and make the circle;
      BOLINGBROKE or SOUTHWELL reads: 'Conjuro te,' &c.
 It thunders and lightens terribly; then the SPIRIT riseth]
[Reads] 'First of the king: what shall of him become?'
'What fates await the Duke of Suffolk?'
'What shall befall the Duke of Somerset?'
Descend to darkness and the burning lake;
False fiend, avoid!       Thunder and lightning. Exit SPIRIT
           Enter the DUKE OF YORK and the DUKE OF
             BUCKINGHAM with guard, and break in
