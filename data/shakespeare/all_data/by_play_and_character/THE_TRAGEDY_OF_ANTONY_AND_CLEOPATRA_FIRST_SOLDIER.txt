Brother, good night. To-morrow is the day.
Nothing. What news?
Well, sir, good night.
                                  [They meet other soldiers]
And you. Good night, good night.
            [The two companies separate and place themselves
                               in every corner of the stage]
Ay; is't not strange?
Follow the noise so far as we have quarter;
Let's see how it will give off.
