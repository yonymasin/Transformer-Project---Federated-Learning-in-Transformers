Good words, Thersites.
No more words, Thersites; peace!
A good riddance.
Who's there? Thersites! Good Thersites, come in and
rail.
What, art thou devout? Wast thou in prayer?
Amen.
                  Enter ACHILLES
Thersites, my lord.
Thy lord, Thersites. Then tell me, I pray thee, what's
Thersites?
Thou must tell that knowest.
You rascal!
Why am I a fool?
Within his tent; but ill-dispos'd, my lord.
I shall say so to him.                              Exit
Achilles bids me say he is much sorry
If any thing more than your sport and pleasure
Did move your greatness and this noble state
To call upon him; he hopes it is no other
But for your health and your digestion sake,
An after-dinner's breath.
I shall, and bring his answer presently.            Exit
They pass by strangely. They were us'd to bend,
To send their smiles before them to Achilles,
To come as humbly as they us'd to creep
To holy altars.
To this effect, Achilles, have I mov'd you.
A woman impudent and mannish grown
Is not more loath'd than an effeminate man
In time of action. I stand condemn'd for this;
They think my little stomach to the war
And your great love to me restrains you thus.
Sweet, rouse yourself; and the weak wanton Cupid
Shall from your neck unloose his amorous fold,
And, like a dew-drop from the lion's mane,
Be shook to airy air.
Ay, and perhaps receive much honour by him.
O, then, beware:
Those wounds heal ill that men do give themselves;
Omission to do what is necessary
Seals a commission to a blank of danger;
And danger, like an ague, subtly taints
Even then when they sit idly in the sun.
Jove bless great Ajax!
I come from the worthy Achilles-
Who most humbly desires you to invite Hector to his
tent-
And to procure safe conduct from Agamemnon.
Ay, my lord.
What you say to't?
Your answer, sir.
Your answer, sir.
But that's no argument for kissing now;
For thus popp'd Paris in his hardiment,
And parted thus you and your argument.
The first was Menelaus' kiss; this, mine-
                                               [Kisses her again]
Patroclus kisses you.
Paris and I kiss evermore for him.
Both take and give.
Here comes Thersites.
               Enter THERSITES
Who keeps the tent now?
Well said, Adversity! and what needs these tricks?
Male varlet, you rogue! What's that?
Why, thou damnable box of envy, thou, what meanest thou
to curse thus?
Why, no, you ruinous butt; you whoreson
indistinguishable cur, no.
Out, gall!
