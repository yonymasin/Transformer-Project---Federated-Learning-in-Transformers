The King comes here tonight.
So please you, it is true; our Thane is coming.
One of my fellows had the speed of him,
Who, almost dead for breath, had scarcely more
Than would make up his message.
Bless you, fair dame! I am not to you known,
Though in your state of honor I am perfect.
I doubt some danger does approach you nearly.
If you will take a homely man's advice,
Be not found here; hence, with your little ones.
To fright you thus, methinks I am too savage;
To do worse to you were fell cruelty,
Which is too nigh your person. Heaven preserve you!
I dare abide no longer.                                Exit.
Gracious my lord,
I should report that which I say I saw,
But know not how to do it.
As I did stand my watch upon the hill,
I look'd toward Birnam, and anon, methought,
The Wood began to move.
Let me endure your wrath, if't be not so.
Within this three mile may you see it coming;
I say, a moving grove.
