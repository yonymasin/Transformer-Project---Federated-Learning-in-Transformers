Ladies, a general welcome from his Grace
Salutes ye all; this night he dedicates
To fair content and you. None here, he hopes,
In all this noble bevy, has brought with her
One care abroad; he would have all as merry
As, first, good company, good wine, good welcome,
Can make good people.
   Enter LORD CHAMBERLAIN, LORD SANDYS, and SIR
              THOMAS LOVELL
O, my lord, y'are tardy,
The very thought of this fair company
Clapp'd wings to me.
