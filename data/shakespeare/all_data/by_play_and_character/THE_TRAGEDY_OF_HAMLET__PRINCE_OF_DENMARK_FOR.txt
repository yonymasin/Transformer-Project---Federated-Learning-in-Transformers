Go, Captain, from me greet the Danish king.
Tell him that by his license Fortinbras
Craves the conveyance of a promis'd march
Over his kingdom. You know the rendezvous.
if that his Majesty would aught with us,
We shall express our duty in his eye;
And let him know so.
Go softly on.
                               Exeunt [all but the Captain].
   Enter Hamlet, Rosencrantz, [Guildenstern,] and others.
