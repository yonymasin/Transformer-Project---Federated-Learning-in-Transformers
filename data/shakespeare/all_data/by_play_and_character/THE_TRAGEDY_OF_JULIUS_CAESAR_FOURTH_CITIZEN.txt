Caesar's better parts
Shall be crown'd in Brutus.
What does he say of Brutus?
'Twere best he speak no harm of Brutus here.
Mark'd ye his words? He would not take the crown;
Therefore 'tis certain he was not ambitious.
Now mark him, he begins again to speak.
We'll hear the will. Read it, Mark Antony.
Read the will; we'll hear it, Antony.
You shall read us the will, Caesar's will.
They were traitors. Honorable men!
A ring, stand round.
O traitors villains!
Pluck down forms, windows, anything.
                              Exeunt Citizens with the body.
Are you a married man or a bachelor?
Ay, and wisely.
For your dwelling, briefly.
Tear him for his bad verses, tear him for his bad
verses.
It is no matter, his name's Cinna. Pluck but his
name out of his heart, and turn him going.
