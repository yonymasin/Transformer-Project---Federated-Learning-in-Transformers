Call'd you, my lord?
I will, my lord.                                 Exit.
The taper burneth in your closet, sir.
Searching the window for a flint I found
This paper thus seal'd up, and I am sure
It did not lie there when I went to bed.
                                       Gives him the letter.
I know not, sir.
I will, sir.                                     Exit.
Sir, March is wasted fifteen days.
                                            Knocking within.
Sir, 'tis your brother Cassius at the door,
Who doth desire to see you.
No, sir, there are more with him.
No, sir, their hats are pluck'd about their ears,
And half their faces buried in their cloaks,
That by no means I may discover them
By any mark of favor.
Here is a sick man that would speak with you.
To know my errand, madam.
Madam, what should I do?
Run to the Capitol, and nothing else?
And so return to you, and nothing else?
I hear none, madam.
Sooth, madam, I hear nothing.
                 Enter the Soothsayer.
Here in the tent.
Varro and Claudio!
               Enter Varro and Claudio.
I was sure your lordship did not give it me.
Ay, my lord, an't please you.
It is my duty, sir.
I have slept, my lord, already.
The strings, my lord, are false.
My lord?
My lord, I do not know that I did cry.
Nothing, my lord.
