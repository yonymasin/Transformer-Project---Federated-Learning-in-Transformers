Fellows, stand fast; I see a passenger.
That's not so, sir; we are your enemies.
Whence came you?
What, were you banish'd thence?
Why, ne'er repent it, if it were done so.
But were you banish'd for so small a fault?
We'll have him. Sirs, a word.
And I for such-like petty crimes as these.
But to the purpose- for we cite our faults
That they may hold excus'd our lawless lives;
And, partly, seeing you are beautified
With goodly shape, and by your own report
A linguist, and a man of such perfection
As we do in our quality much want-
But if thou scorn our courtesy thou diest.
Come, come.
Be patient; we must bring you to our captain.
Where is the gentleman that was with her?
Come, I must bring you to our captain's cave;
Fear not; he bears an honourable mind,
And will not use a woman lawlessly.
