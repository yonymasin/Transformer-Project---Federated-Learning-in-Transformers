No doubt, my liege, if each man do his best.
So service shall with steeled sinews toil,
And labour shall refresh itself with hope,
To do your Grace incessant services.
That's mercy, but too much security.
Let him be punish'd, sovereign, lest example
Breed, by his sufferance, more of such a kind.
So did you me, my liege.
Our purposes God justly hath discover'd,
And I repent my fault more than my death;
Which I beseech your Highness to forgive,
Although my body pay the price of it.
