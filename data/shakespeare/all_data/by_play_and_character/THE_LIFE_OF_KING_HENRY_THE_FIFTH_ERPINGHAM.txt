Not so, my liege; this lodging likes me better,
Since I may say 'Now lie I like a king.'
Shall I attend your Grace?
The Lord in heaven bless thee, noble Harry!
                                     Exeunt all but the KING
My lord, your nobles, jealous of your absence,
Seek through your camp to find you.
I shall do't, my lord.                         Exit
