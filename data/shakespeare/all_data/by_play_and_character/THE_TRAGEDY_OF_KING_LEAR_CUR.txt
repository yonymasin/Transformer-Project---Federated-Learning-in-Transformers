And you, sir. I have been with your father, and given him
 notice that the Duke of Cornwall and Regan his Duchess will be
 here with him this night.
Nay, I know not. You have heard of the news abroad- I mean the
 whisper'd ones, for they are yet but ear-kissing arguments?
Have you heard of no likely wars toward 'twixt the two Dukes
 of Cornwall and Albany?
You may do, then, in time. Fare you well, sir.      Exit.
