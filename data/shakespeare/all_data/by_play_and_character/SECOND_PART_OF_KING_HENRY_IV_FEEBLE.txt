Here, sir.
A woman's tailor, sir.
I will do my good will, sir; you can have no more.
I would Wart might have gone, sir.
It shall suffice, sir.
By my troth, I care not; a man can die but once; we owe God
a death. I'll ne'er bear a base mind. An't be my destiny, so;
an't be not, so. No man's too good to serve 's Prince; and, let
it go which way it will, he that dies this year is quit for the
next.
Faith, I'll bear no base mind.
