Is she to be buried in Christian burial when she wilfully
seeks her own salvation?
How can that be, unless she drown'd herself in her own
defence?
It must be se offendendo; it cannot be else. For here lies
the point: if I drown myself wittingly, it argues an act; and an
act hath three branches-it is to act, to do, and to perform;
argal, she drown'd herself wittingly.
Give me leave. Here lies the water; good. Here stands the
man; good. If the man go to this water and drown himself, it is,
will he nill he, he goes- mark you that. But if the water come to
him and drown him, he drowns not himself. Argal, he that is not
guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.
Ay, marry, is't- crowner's quest law.
Why, there thou say'st! And the more pity that great folk
should have count'nance in this world to drown or hang themselves
more than their even-Christen. Come, my spade! There is no
ancient gentlemen but gard'ners, ditchers, and grave-makers. They
hold up Adam's profession.
'A was the first that ever bore arms.
What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the Scripture?
The Scripture says Adam digg'd. Could he dig without arms? I'll
put another question to thee. If thou answerest me not to the
purpose, confess thyself-
What is he that builds stronger than either the mason, the
shipwright, or the carpenter?
I like thy wit well, in good faith. The gallows does well.
But how does it well? It does well to those that do ill. Now,
thou dost ill to say the gallows is built stronger than the
church. Argal, the gallows may do well to thee. To't again, come!
Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.
To't.
Cudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dull ass will
not mend his pace with beating; and when you are ask'd this
question next, say 'a grave-maker.' The houses he makes lasts
till doomsday. Go, get thee to Yaughan; fetch me a stoup of
liquor.

                   [Clown digs and] sings.
   In youth when I did love, did love,
     Methought it was very sweet;
   To contract- O- the time for- a- my behove,
     O, methought there- a- was nothing- a- meet.
(sings)
     But age with his stealing steps
       Hath clawed me in his clutch,
     And hath shipped me intil the land,
       As if I had never been such.
                                        [Throws up a skull.]
(Sings)
     A pickaxe and a spade, a spade,
       For and a shrouding sheet;
     O, a Pit of clay for to be made
       For such a guest is meet.
                                  Throws up [another skull].
Mine, sir.
[Sings] O, a pit of clay for to be made
          For such a guest is meet.
You lie out on't, sir, and therefore 'tis not yours.
For my part, I do not lie in't, yet it is mine.
'Tis a quick lie, sir; 'twill away again from me to you.
For no man, sir.
For none neither.
One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she's dead.
Of all the days i' th' year, I came to't that day that our
last king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.
Cannot you tell that? Every fool can tell that. It was the
very day that young Hamlet was born- he that is mad, and sent
into England.
Why, because 'a was mad. 'A shall recover his wits there;
or, if 'a do not, 'tis no great matter there.
'Twill not he seen in him there. There the men are as mad as
he.
Very strangely, they say.
Faith, e'en with losing his wits.
Why, here in Denmark. I have been sexton here, man and boy
thirty years.
Faith, if 'a be not rotten before 'a die (as we have many
pocky corses now-a-days that will scarce hold the laying in, I
will last you some eight year or nine year. A tanner will last
you nine year.
Why, sir, his hide is so tann'd with his trade that 'a will
keep out water a great while; and your water is a sore decayer of
your whoreson dead body. Here's a skull now. This skull hath lien
you i' th' earth three-and-twenty years.
A whoreson, mad fellow's it was. Whose do you think it was?
A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! 'A pour'd a flagon of
Rhenish on my head once. This same skull, sir, was Yorick's
skull, the King's jester.
E'en that.
