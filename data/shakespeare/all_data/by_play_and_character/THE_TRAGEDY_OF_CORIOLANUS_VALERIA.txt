My ladies both, good day to you.
How do you both? You are manifest housekeepers. What are
you sewing here? A fine spot, in good faith. How does your little
son?
O' my word, the father's son! I'll swear 'tis a very
pretty boy. O' my troth, I look'd upon him a Wednesday half an
hour together; has such a confirm'd countenance! I saw him run
after a gilded butterfly; and when he caught it he let it go
again, and after it again, and over and over he comes, and up
again, catch'd it again; or whether his fall enrag'd him, or how
'twas, he did so set his teeth and tear it. O, I warrant, how he
mammock'd it!
Indeed, la, 'tis a noble child.
Come, lay aside your stitchery; I must have you play the
idle huswife with me this afternoon.
Not out of doors!
Fie, you confine yourself most unreasonably; come, you
must go visit the good lady that lies in.
You would be another Penelope; yet they say all the yarn
she spun in Ulysses' absence did but fill Ithaca full of moths.
Come, I would your cambric were sensible as your finger, that you
might leave pricking it for pity. Come, you shall go with us.
In truth, la, go with me; and I'll tell you excellent news
of your husband.
Verily, I do not jest with you; there came news from him
last night.
In earnest, it's true; I heard a senator speak it. Thus it
is: the Volsces have an army forth; against whom Cominius the
general is gone, with one part of our Roman power. Your lord and
Titus Lartius are set down before their city Corioli; they
nothing doubt prevailing and to make it brief wars. This is true,
on mine honour; and so, I pray, go with us.
In troth, I think she would. Fare you well, then. Come,
good sweet lady. Prithee, Virgilia, turn thy solemness out o'
door and go along with us.
Well then, farewell.                           Exeunt
In troth, there's wondrous things spoke of him.
