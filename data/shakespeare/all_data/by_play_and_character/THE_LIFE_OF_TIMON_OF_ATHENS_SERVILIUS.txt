See, by good hap, yonder's my lord; I have sweat to see
his honour.- My honour'd lord!
May it please your honour, my lord hath sent-
Has only sent his present occasion now, my lord,
requesting your lordship to supply his instant use with so many
talents.
But in the mean time he wants less, my lord.
If his occasion were not virtuous
I should not urge it half so faithfully.
Upon my soul, 'tis true, sir.
Yes, sir, I shall.
If I might beseech you, gentlemen, to repair some other
hour, I should derive much from't; for take't of my soul, my lord
leans wondrously to discontent. His comfortable temper has
forsook him; he's much out of health and keeps his chamber.
And if it be so far beyond his health,
Methinks he should the sooner pay his debts,
And make a clear way to the gods.
Good gods!
