Thou art going to Lord Timon's feast.
Fare thee well, fare thee well.
Why, Apemantus?
Away, unpeaceable dog, or I'll spurn thee hence.
He pours it out: Plutus, the god of gold,
Is but his steward; no meed but he repays
Sevenfold above itself; no gift to him
But breeds the giver a return exceeding
All use of quittance.
Long may he live in fortunes! shall we in?
Let it flow this way, my good lord.
Joy had the like conception in our eyes,
And at that instant like a babe sprung up.
Our horses!
           Re-enter FLAVIUS, with the casket
With more than common thanks I will receive it.
So infinitely endear'd-
I also wish it to you. I think this honourable lord
did but try us this other day.
It should not be, by the persuasion of his new
feasting.
In like manner was I in debt to my importunate
business, but he would not hear my excuse. I am sorry, when he
sent to borrow of me, that my provision was out.
Every man here's so. What would he have borrowed of
you?
A thousand pieces!
He sent to me, sir- here he comes.
               Enter TIMON and attendants
The swallow follows not summer more willing than we
your lordship.
My noble lord-
My most honourable lord, I am e'en sick of shame that,
when your lordship this other day sent to me, I was so
unfortunate a beggar.
If you had sent but two hours before-
All cover'd dishes!
I pray you, upon what?
This is the old man still.
It does; but time will- and so-
Know you the quality of Lord Timon's fury?
Here 'tis.
Lord Timon's mad.
