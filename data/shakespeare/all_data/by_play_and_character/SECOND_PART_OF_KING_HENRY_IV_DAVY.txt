Here, sir.
Marry, sir, thus: those precepts cannot be served; and,
again, sir- shall we sow the headland with wheat?
Yes, sir. Here is now the smith's note for shoeing and
plough-irons.
Now, sir, a new link to the bucket must needs be had; and,
sir, do you mean to stop any of William's wages about the sack he
lost the other day at Hinckley fair?
Doth the man of war stay all night, sir?
No worse than they are backbitten, sir; for they have
marvellous foul linen.
I beseech you, sir, to countenance William Visor of Woncot
against Clement Perkes o' th' hill.
I grant your worship that he is a knave, sir; but yet God
forbid, sir, but a knave should have some countenance at his
friend's request. An honest man, sir, is able to speak for
himself, when a knave is not. I have serv'd your worship truly,
sir, this eight years; an I cannot once or twice in a quarter
bear out a knave against an honest man, I have but a very little
credit with your worship. The knave is mine honest friend, sir;
therefore, I beseech you, let him be countenanc'd.
 [Exit DAVY]  Where are you, Sir John? Come, come, come, off
with your boots. Give me your hand, Master Bardolph.
Sweet sir, sit; I'll be with you anon; most sweet sir, sit.
Master Page, good Master Page, sit. Proface! What you want in
meat, we'll have in drink. But you must bear; the heart's all.
 [To BARDOLPH]  There's a dish of leather-coats for you.
Your worship! I'll be with you straight.  [To BARDOLPH]
A cup of wine, sir?
I hope to see London once ere I die.
An't please your worship, there's one Pistol come from the
court with news.
