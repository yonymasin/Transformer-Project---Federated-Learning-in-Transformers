O wall, full often hast thou beard my moans,
For parting my fair Pyramus and me!
My cherry lips have often kiss'd thy stones,
Thy stones with lime and hair knit up in thee.
My love! thou art my love, I think.
And I like Helen, till the Fates me kill.
As Shafalus to Procrus, I to you.
I kiss the wall's hole, not your lips at all.
Tide life, tide death, I come without delay.
                                   Exeunt PYRAMUS and THISBY
This is old Ninny's tomb. Where is my love?
     Asleep, my love?
           What, dead, my dove?
         O Pyramus, arise,
           Speak, speak. Quite dumb?
           Dead, dead? A tomb
         Must cover thy sweet eyes.
           These lily lips,
           This cherry nose,
         These yellow cowslip cheeks,
           Are gone, are gone;
           Lovers, make moan;
         His eyes were green as leeks.
           O Sisters Three,
           Come, come to me,
         With hands as pale as milk;
           Lay them in gore,
           Since you have shore
         With shears his thread of silk.
           Tongue, not a word.
           Come, trusty sword;
         Come, blade, my breast imbrue.      [Stabs herself]
           And farewell, friends;
           Thus Thisby ends;
         Adieu, adieu, adieu.                         [Dies]
