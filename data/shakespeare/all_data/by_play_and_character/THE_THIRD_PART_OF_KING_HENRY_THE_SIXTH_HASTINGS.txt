Why, knows not Montague that of itself
England is safe, if true within itself?
'Tis better using France than trusting France.
Let us be back'd with God, and with the seas
Which He hath giv'n for fence impregnable,
And with their helps only defend ourselves.
In them and in ourselves our safety lies.
And Hastings as he favours Edward's cause!
To Lynn, my lord; and shipt from thence to Flanders.
My liege, I'll knock once more to summon them.
     Enter, on the walls, the MAYOR OF YORK and
                   his BRETHREN
Why, Master Mayor, why stand you in a doubt?
Open the gates; we are King Henry's friends.
The good old man would fain that all were well,
So 'twere not long of him; but being ent'red,
I doubt not, I, but we shall soon persuade
Both him and all his brothers unto reason.
         Enter, below, the MAYOR and two ALDERMEN
Away with scrupulous wit! Now arms must rule.
Sound trumpet; Edward shall be here proclaim'd.
Come, fellow soldier, make thou proclamation.
                               [Gives him a paper. Flourish]
