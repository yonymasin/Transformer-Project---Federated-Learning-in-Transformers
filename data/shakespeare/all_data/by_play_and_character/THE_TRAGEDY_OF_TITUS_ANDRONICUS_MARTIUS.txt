He is not with himself; let us withdraw.
And mine, I promise you; were it not for shame,
Well could I leave our sport to sleep awhile.
                                        [Falls into the pit]
O brother, with the dismal'st object hurt
That ever eye with sight made heart lament!
Why dost not comfort me, and help me out
From this unhallow'd and blood-stained hole?
To prove thou hast a true divining heart,
Aaron and thou look down into this den,
And see a fearful sight of blood and death.
Lord Bassianus lies beray'd in blood,
All on a heap, like to a slaughtered lamb,
In this detested, dark, blood-drinking pit.
Upon his bloody finger he doth wear
A precious ring that lightens all this hole,
Which, like a taper in some monument,
Doth shine upon the dead man's earthy cheeks,
And shows the ragged entrails of this pit;
So pale did shine the moon on Pyramus
When he by night lay bath'd in maiden blood.
O brother, help me with thy fainting hand-
If fear hath made thee faint, as me it hath-
Out of this fell devouring receptacle,
As hateful as Cocytus' misty mouth.
Nor I no strength to climb without thy help.
The unhappy sons of old Andronicus,
Brought hither in a most unlucky hour,
To find thy brother Bassianus dead.
We know not where you left them all alive;
But, out alas! here have we found him dead.
               Re-enter TAMORA, with
     attendants; TITUS ANDRONICUS and Lucius
