The Queen, madam,
Desires your Highness' company.
I, madam.
Please you, madam.
Almost midnight, madam.
Who's there that knocks?
No more?
That's more
Than some whose tailors are as dear as yours
Can justly boast of. What's your lordship's pleasure?
Ay,
To keep her chamber.
How? My good name? or to report of you
What I shall think is good? The Princess!
                    Enter IMOGEN
We did, so please your Highness.
