Here, sir; what is your pleasure?
I go, sir.
I will, sir.
Good even, Varro. What, you come for money?
It is. And yours too, Isidore?
Would we were all discharg'd!
Here comes the lord.
        Enter TIMON and his train, with ALCIBIADES
My lord, here is a note of certain dues.
Of Athens here, my lord.
Please it your lordship, he hath put me off
To the succession of new days this month.
My master is awak'd by great occasion
To call upon his own, and humbly prays you
That with your other noble parts you'll suit
In giving him his right.
Nay, good my lord-
If you did know, my lord, my master's wants-
past.
I am sent expressly to your lordship.
Stay, stay, here comes the fool with Apemantus.
Let's ha' some sport with 'em.
Where's the fool now?
