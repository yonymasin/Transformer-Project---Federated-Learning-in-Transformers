Wine, wine, wine! What service is here! I think our
fellows are asleep.                                     Exit
                 Enter another SERVINGMAN
Cotus!                                                  Exit
                   Enter CORIOLANUS
What would you have, friend?
Whence are you? Here's no place for you: pray go to the door.
A strange one as ever I look'd on. I cannot get him
out o' th' house. Prithee call my master to him.
Here's a strange alteration!
What an arm he has! He turn'd me about with his
finger and his thumb, as one would set up a top.
He had so, looking as it were- Would I were hang'd,
but I thought there was more in him than I could think.
I think he is; but a greater soldier than he you wot
on.
Nay, it's no matter for that.
Nay, not so neither; but I take him to be the
greater soldier.
Ay, and for an assault too.
                   Re-enter the third SERVINGMAN
Why do you say 'thwack our general'?
He was too hard for him directly, to say the troth
on't; before Corioli he scotch'd him and notch'd him like a
carbonado.
But more of thy news!
Directitude? What's that?
But when goes this forward?
Let me have war, say I; it exceeds peace as far as
day does night; it's spritely, waking, audible, and full of vent.
Peace is a very apoplexy, lethargy; mull'd, deaf, sleepy,
insensible; a getter of more bastard children than war's a
destroyer of men.
Ay, and it makes men hate one another.
