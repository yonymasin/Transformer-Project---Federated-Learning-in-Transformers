To his own hand, in's bedchamber.
Presently
He did unseal them; and the first he view'd,
He did it with a serious mind; a heed
Was in his countenance. You he bade
Attend him here this morning.
I think by this he is.
I have no power to speak, sir.
How does your Grace?
I am glad your Grace has made that right use of it.
The heaviest and the worst
Is your displeasure with the King.
The next is that Sir Thomas More is chosen
Lord Chancellor in your place.
That Cranmer is return'd with welcome,
Install'd Lord Archbishop of Canterbury.
Last, that the Lady Anne,
Whom the King hath in secrecy long married,
This day was view'd in open as his queen,
Going to chapel; and the voice is now
Only about her coronation.
O my lord,
Must I then leave you? Must I needs forgo
So good, so noble, and so true a master?
Bear witness, all that have not hearts of iron,
With what a sorrow Cromwell leaves his lord.
The King shall have my service; but my prayers
For ever and for ever shall be yours.
Good sir, have patience.
Please your honours,
The chief cause concerns his Grace of Canterbury.
Yes.
My Lord of Winchester, y'are a little,
By your good favour, too sharp; men so noble,
However faulty, yet should find respect
For what they have been; 'tis a cruelty
To load a falling man.
Why, my lord?
Not sound?
Would you were half so honest!
Men's prayers then would seek you, not their fears.
Do.
Remember your bold life too.
And I.
My mind gave me,
In seeking tales and informations
Against this man-whose honesty the devil
And his disciples only envy at-
Ye blew the fire that burns ye. Now have at ye!
  Enter the KING frowning on them; he takes his seat
