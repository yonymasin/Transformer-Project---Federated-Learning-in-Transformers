My Lord Fitzwater, I do remember well
The very time Aumerle and you did talk.
As false, by heaven, as heaven itself is true.
Dishonourable boy!
That lie shall lie so heavy on my sword
That it shall render vengeance and revenge
Till thou the lie-giver and that lie do he
In earth as quiet as thy father's skull.
In proof whereof, there is my honour's pawn;
Engage it to the trial, if thou dar'st.
