News, my good lord, from Rome.
Fulvia thy wife first came into the field.
Ay.
But soon that war had end, and the time's state
Made friends of them, jointing their force 'gainst Caesar,
Whose better issue in the war from Italy
Upon the first encounter drave them.
The nature of bad news infects the teller.
Labienus-
This is stiff news- hath with his Parthian force
Extended Asia from Euphrates,
His conquering banner shook from Syria
To Lydia and to Ionia,
Whilst-
O, my lord!
At your noble pleasure.                        Exit
Thy biddings have been done; and every hour,
Most noble Caesar, shalt thou have report
How 'tis abroad. Pompey is strong at sea,
And it appears he is belov'd of those
That only have fear'd Caesar. To the ports
The discontents repair, and men's reports
Give him much wrong'd.
Caesar, I bring thee word
Menecrates and Menas, famous pirates,
Make the sea serve them, which they ear and wound
With keels of every kind. Many hot inroads
They make in Italy; the borders maritime
Lack blood to think on't, and flush youth revolt.
No vessel can peep forth but 'tis as soon
Taken as seen; for Pompey's name strikes more
Than could his war resisted.
Madam, madam-
First, madam, he is well.
Good madam, hear me.
Will't please you hear me?
Madam, he's well.
And friends with Caesar.
Caesar and he are greater friends than ever.
But yet, madam-
Free, madam! No; I made no such report.
He's bound unto Octavia.
For the best turn i' th' bed.
Madam, he's married to Octavia.
Good madam, patience.
Gracious madam,
I that do bring the news made not the match.
He's married, madam.
Nay, then I'll run.
What mean you, madam? I have made no fault.             Exit
I have done my duty.
He's married, madam.
Should I lie, madam?
I crave your Highness' pardon.
Take no offence that I would not offend you;
To punish me for what you make me do
Seems much unequal. He's married to Octavia.
Most gracious Majesty!
Ay, dread Queen.
Madam, in Rome
I look'd her in the face, and saw her led
Between her brother and Mark Antony.
She is not, madam.
Madam, I heard her speak: she is low-voic'd.
She creeps.
Her motion and her station are as one;
She shows a body rather than a life,
A statue than a breather.
Or I have no observance.
Madam,
She was a widow.
And I do think she's thirty.
Round even to faultiness.
Brown, madam; and her forehead
As low as she would wish it.
The news is true, my lord: he is descried;
Caesar has taken Toryne.
The Emperor calls Canidius.
Antony
Is come into the field.
