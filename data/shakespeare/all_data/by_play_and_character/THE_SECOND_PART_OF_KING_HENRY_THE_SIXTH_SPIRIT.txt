Adsum.
Ask what thou wilt; that I had said and done.
The Duke yet lives that Henry shall depose;
But him outlive, and die a violent death.
         [As the SPIRIT speaks, SOUTHWELL writes the answer]
By water shall he die and take his end.
Let him shun castles:
Safer shall he be upon the sandy plains
Than where castles mounted stand.
Have done, for more I hardly can endure.
