'Tis some mischance; the cry is very direful.
Here's one comes in his shirt, with light and weapons.
This is Othello's ancient, as I take it.
Cassio?
I am sorry to find you thus; I have been to seek you.
What, of Venice?
                            Know him! ay.
               I am glad to see you.
Roderigo!
What is the matter?
'Tis a strange truth.
Poor Desdemon! I am glad thy father's dead.
Thy match was mortal to him, and pure grief
Shore his old thread in twain; did he live now,
This sight would make him do a desperate turn,
Yea, curse his better angel from his side,
And fall to reprobation.
                                   Fie!
Your sword upon a woman?
The woman falls; sure, he hath kill'd his wife.
He's gone, but his wife's kill'd.
[Within.] If thou attempt it, it will cost thee dear.
Thou hast no weapon, and perforce must suffer.
What is the matter?
                   Torments will ope your lips.
                 All that's spoke is marr'd.
