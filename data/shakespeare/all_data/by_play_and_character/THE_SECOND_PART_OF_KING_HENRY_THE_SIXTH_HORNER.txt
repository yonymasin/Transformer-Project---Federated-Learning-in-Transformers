An't shall please your Majesty, I never said nor thought
any such matter. God is my witness, I am falsely accus'd by the
villain.
And I accept the combat willingly.
Let it come, i' faith, and I'll pledge you all; and a fig
for Peter!
Masters, I am come hither, as it were, upon my man's
instigation, to prove him a knave and myself an honest man; and
touching the Duke of York, I will take my death I never meant him
any ill, nor the King, nor the Queen; and therefore, Peter, have
at thee with a down right blow!
Hold, Peter, hold! I confess, I confess treason.
                                                      [Dies]
