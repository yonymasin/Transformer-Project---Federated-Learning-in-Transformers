Born blind, an't please your Grace.
At Berwick in the north, an't like your Grace.
God knows, of pure devotion; being call'd
A hundred times and oft'ner, in my sleep,
By good Saint Alban, who said 'Simpcox, come,
Come, offer at my shrine, and I will help thee.'
Ay, God Almighty help me!
A fall off of a tree.
O, born so, master!
But that in all my life, when I was a youth.
Alas, good master, my wife desir'd some damsons
And made me climb, With danger of my life.
Yes, master, clear as day, I thank God and Saint Alban.
Red, master; red as blood.
Black, forsooth; coal-black as jet.
Alas, master, I know not.
I know not.
No, indeed, master.
Saunder Simpcox, an if it please you, master.
O master, that you could!
Alas, master, I am not able to stand alone!
You go about to torture me in vain.
                     Enter a BEADLE with whips
Alas, master, what shall I do? I am not able to stand.
       After the BEADLE hath hit him once, he leaps over
       the stool and runs away; and they follow and cry
                         'A miracle!'
