Barely in title, not in revenues.
Tends that thou wouldst speak to the Duke of Hereford?
If it be so, out with it boldly, man;
Quick is mine ear to hear of good towards him.
And daily new exactions are devis'd,
As blanks, benevolences, and I wot not what;
But what, a God's name, doth become of this?
The King's grown bankrupt like a broken man.
Nay, let us share thy thoughts as thou dost ours.
Hold out my horse, and I will first be there.
                                                      Exeunt
And far surmounts our labour to attain it.
Base men by his endowments are made great.
