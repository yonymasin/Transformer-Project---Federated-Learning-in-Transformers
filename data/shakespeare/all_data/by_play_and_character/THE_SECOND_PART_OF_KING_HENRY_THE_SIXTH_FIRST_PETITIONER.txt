My masters, let's stand close; my Lord Protector
will come this way by and by, and then we may deliver our
supplications in the quill.
Here 'a comes, methinks, and the Queen with him.
I'll be the first, sure.
I pray, my lord, pardon me; I took ye for my Lord
Protector.
Mine is, an't please your Grace, against John
Goodman, my Lord Cardinal's man, for keeping my house and lands,
and wife and all, from me.
