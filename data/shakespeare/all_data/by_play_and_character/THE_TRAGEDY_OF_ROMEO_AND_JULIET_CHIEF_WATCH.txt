[within] Lead, boy. Which way?
Yea, noise? Then I'll be brief. O happy dagger!
                                  [Snatches Romeo's dagger.]
This is thy sheath; there rest, and let me die.
              She stabs herself and falls [on Romeo's body].
            Enter [Paris's] Boy and Watch.
'the ground is bloody. Search about the churchyard.
Go, some of you; whoe'er you find attach.
                                 [Exeunt some of the Watch.]
Pitiful sight! here lies the County slain;
And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,
Who here hath lain this two days buried.
Go, tell the Prince; run to the Capulets;
Raise up the Montagues; some others search.
                               [Exeunt others of the Watch.]
We see the ground whereon these woes do lie,
But the true ground of all these piteous woes
We cannot without circumstance descry.
 Enter [some of the Watch,] with Romeo's Man [Balthasar].
Hold him in safety till the Prince come hither.
      Enter Friar [Laurence] and another Watchman.
We took this mattock and this spade from him
As he was coming from this churchyard side.
A great suspicion! Stay the friar too.
          Enter the Prince [and Attendants].
Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain;
And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before,
Warm and new kill'd.
Here is a friar, and slaughter'd Romeo's man,
With instruments upon them fit to open
These dead men's tombs.
