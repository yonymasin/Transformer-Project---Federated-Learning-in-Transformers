Come on, come on, come on; give me your hand, sir; give me
your hand, sir. An early stirrer, by the rood! And how doth my
good cousin Silence?
And how doth my cousin, your bed-fellow? and your fairest
daughter and mine, my god-daughter Ellen?
By yea and no, sir. I dare say my cousin William is become
a good scholar; he is at Oxford still, is he not?
'A must, then, to the Inns o' Court shortly. I was once of
Clement's Inn; where I think they will talk of mad Shallow yet.
By the mass, I was call'd anything; and I would have done
anything indeed too, and roundly too. There was I, and little
John Doit of Staffordshire, and black George Barnes, and Francis
Pickbone, and Will Squele a Cotsole man- you had not four such
swinge-bucklers in all the Inns of Court again. And I may say to
you we knew where the bona-robas were, and had the best of them
all at commandment. Then was Jack Falstaff, now Sir John, boy,
and page to Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk.
The same Sir John, the very same. I see him break
Scoggin's head at the court gate, when 'a was a crack not thus
high; and the very same day did I fight with one Sampson
Stockfish, a fruiterer, behind Gray's Inn. Jesu, Jesu, the mad
days that I have spent! and to see how many of my old
acquaintance are dead!
Certain, 'tis certain; very sure, very sure. Death, as the
Psalmist saith, is certain to all; all shall die. How a good yoke
of bullocks at Stamford fair?
Death is certain. Is old Double of your town living yet?
Jesu, Jesu, dead! drew a good bow; and dead! 'A shot a
fine shoot. John a Gaunt loved him well, and betted much money on
his head. Dead! 'A would have clapp'd i' th' clout at twelve
score, and carried you a forehand shaft a fourteen and fourteen
and a half, that it would have done a man's heart good to see.
How a score of ewes now?
And is old Double dead?
                Enter BARDOLPH, and one with him
Good morrow, honest gentlemen.
I am Robert Shallow, sir, a poor esquire of this county,
and one of the King's justices of the peace. What is your good
pleasure with me?
He greets me well, sir; I knew him a good back-sword man.
How doth the good knight? May I ask how my lady his wife doth?
It is well said, in faith, sir; and it is well said indeed
too. 'Better accommodated!' It is good; yea, indeed, is it. Good
phrases are surely, and ever were, very commendable.
'Accommodated!' It comes of accommodo. Very good; a good phrase.
It is very just. Look, here comes good Sir John. Give me
your good hand, give me your worship's good hand. By my troth,
you like well and bear your years very well. Welcome, good Sir
John.
No, Sir John; it is my cousin Silence, in commission with
Marry, have we, sir. Will you sit?
Where's the roll? Where's the roll? Where's the roll? Let
me see, let me see, let me see. So, so, so, so,- so, so- yea,
marry, sir. Rafe Mouldy! Let them appear as I call; let them do
so, let them do so. Let me see; where is Mouldy?
What think you, Sir John? A good-limb'd fellow; young,
strong, and of good friends.
Ha, ha, ha! most excellent, i' faith! Things that are
mouldy lack use. Very singular good! In faith, well said, Sir
John; very well said.
Peace, fellow, peace; stand aside; know you where you are?
For th' other, Sir John- let me see. Simon Shadow!
Where's Shadow?
Do you like him, Sir John?
Thomas Wart!
Shall I prick him, Sir John?
Ha, ha, ha! You can do it, sir; you can do it. I commend
you well. Francis Feeble!
Shall I prick him, sir?
Peter Bullcalf o' th' green!
Here is two more call'd than your number. You must have
but four here, sir; and so, I pray you, go in with me to dinner.
O, Sir John, do you remember since we lay all night in the
windmill in Saint George's Field?
Ha, 'twas a merry night. And is Jane Nightwork alive?
She never could away with me.
By the mass, I could anger her to th' heart. She was then
a bona-roba. Doth she hold her own well?
Nay, she must be old; she cannot choose but be old;
certain she's old; and had Robin Nightwork, by old Nightwork,
before I came to Clement's Inn.
Ha, cousin Silence, that thou hadst seen that that this
knight and I have seen! Ha, Sir John, said I well?
That we have, that we have, that we have; in faith, Sir
John, we have. Our watchword was 'Hem, boys!' Come, let's to
dinner; come, let's to dinner. Jesus, the days that we have seen!
Come, come.
                            Exeunt FALSTAFF and the JUSTICES
Four of which you please.
Come, Sir John, which four will you have?
Marry, then- Mouldy, Bullcalf, Feeble, and Shadow.
Sir John, Sir John, do not yourself wrong. They are your
likeliest men, and I would have you serv'd with the best.
He is not his craft's master, he doth not do it right. I
remember at Mile-end Green, when I lay at Clement's Inn- I was
then Sir Dagonet in Arthur's show- there was a little quiver
fellow, and 'a would manage you his piece thus; and 'a would
about and about, and come you in and come you in. 'Rah, tah,
tah!' would 'a say; 'Bounce!' would 'a say; and away again would
'a go, and again would 'a come. I shall ne'er see such a fellow.
Sir John, the Lord bless you; God prosper your affairs;
God send us peace! At your return, visit our house; let our old
acquaintance be renewed. Peradventure I will with ye to the
court.
Go to; I have spoke at a word. God keep you.
By cock and pie, sir, you shall not away to-night.
What, Davy, I say!
I will not excuse you; you shall not be excus'd; excuses
shall not be admitted; there is no excuse shall serve; you shall
not be excus'd. Why, Davy!
                        Enter DAVY
Davy, Davy, Davy, Davy; let me see, Davy; let me see,
Davy; let me see- yea, marry, William cook, bid him come hither.
Sir John, you shall not be excus'd.
With red wheat, Davy. But for William cook- are there no
young pigeons?
Let it be cast, and paid. Sir John, you shall not be
excused.
'A shall answer it. Some pigeons, Davy, a couple of
short-legg'd hens, a joint of mutton, and any pretty little tiny
kickshaws, tell William cook.
Yea, Davy; I will use him well. A friend i' th' court is
better than a penny in purse. Use his men well, Davy; for they
are arrant knaves and will backbite.
Well conceited, Davy- about thy business, Davy.
There, is many complaints, Davy, against that Visor. That
Visor is an arrant knave, on my knowledge.
Go to; I say he shall have no wrong. Look about,
I thank thee with all my heart, kind Master Bardolph.
[To the PAGE]  And welcome, my tall fellow. Come, Sir John.
 [Within]  Sir John!
Nay, you shall see my orchard, where, in an arbour, we
will eat a last year's pippin of mine own graffing, with a dish
of caraways, and so forth. Come, cousin Silence. And then to bed.
Barren, barren, barren; beggars all, beggars all, Sir John
-marry, good air. Spread, Davy, spread, Davy; well said, Davy.
A good varlet, a good varlet, a very good varlet, Sir
John. By the mass, I have drunk too much sack at supper. A good
varlet. Now sit down, now sit down; come, cousin.
Give Master Bardolph some wine, Davy.
Be merry, Master Bardolph; and, my little soldier there,
be merry.
Davy!
Honest Bardolph, welcome; if thou want'st anything and
wilt not call, beshrew thy heart. Welcome, my little tiny thief
and welcome indeed too. I'll drink to Master Bardolph, and to all
the cabileros about London.
By the mass, you'R crack a quart together- ha! will you
not, Master Bardolph?
By God's liggens, I thank thee. The knave will stick by
thee, I can assure thee that. 'A will not out, 'a; 'tis true
bred.
Why, there spoke a king. Lack nothing; be merry.
[One knocks at door]  Look who's at door there, ho! Who knocks?
                                                   Exit DAVY
Honest gentleman, I know not your breeding.
Give me pardon, sir. If, sir, you come with news from the
court, I take it there's but two ways- either to utter them or
conceal them. I am, sir, under the King, in some authority.
Under King Harry.
Harry the Fourth.
It doth so.
It doth so.
It doth, it doth, it doth.
It is best, certain.
'Tis so, indeed.
Yea, marry, Sir John; which I beseech you to let me have
home with me.
I cannot perceive how, unless you give me your doublet,
and stuff me out with straw. I beseech you, good Sir John, let me
have five hundred of my thousand.
A colour that I fear you will die in, Sir John.
