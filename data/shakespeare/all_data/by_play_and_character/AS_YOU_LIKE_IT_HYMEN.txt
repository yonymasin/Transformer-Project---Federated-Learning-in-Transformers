   Peace, ho! I bar confusion;
        'Tis I must make conclusion
          Of these most strange events.
        Here's eight that must take hands
        To join in Hymen's bands,
          If truth holds true contents.
        You and you no cross shall part;
        You and you are heart in heart;
        You to his love must accord,
        Or have a woman to your lord;
        You and you are sure together,
        As the winter to foul weather.
        Whiles a wedlock-hymn we sing,
        Feed yourselves with questioning,
        That reason wonder may diminish,
        How thus we met, and these things finish.
                   SONG
        Wedding is great Juno's crown;
          O blessed bond of board and bed!
        'Tis Hymen peoples every town;
          High wedlock then be honoured.
        Honour, high honour, and renown,
        To Hymen, god of every town!
