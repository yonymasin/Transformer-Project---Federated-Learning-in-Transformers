He has no equal.
Mark'd you his lip and eyes?
Being mov'd, he will not spare to gird the gods.
The present wars devour him! He is grown
Too proud to be so valiant.
Fame, at the which he aims-
In whom already he is well grac'd- cannot
Better be held nor more attain'd than by
A place below the first; for what miscarries
Shall be the general's fault, though he perform
To th' utmost of a man, and giddy censure
Will then cry out of Marcius 'O, if he
Had borne the business!'
Come.
Half all Cominius' honours are to Marcius,
Though Marcius earn'd them not; and all his faults
To Marcius shall be honours, though indeed
In aught he merit not.
Let's along.                                    Exeunt
Good or bad?
He's a lamb indeed, that baes like a bear.
He's poor in no one fault, but stor'd with all.
And topping all others in boasting.
We do it not alone, sir.
Come, sir, come, we know you well enough.
Come, come, you are well understood to be a perfecter giber
for the table than a necessary bencher in the Capitol.
All tongues speak of him and the bleared sights
Are spectacled to see him. Your prattling nurse
Into a rapture lets her baby cry
While she chats him; the kitchen malkin pins
Her richest lockram 'bout her reechy neck,
Clamb'ring the walls to eye him; stalls, bulks, windows,
Are smother'd up, leads fill'd and ridges hors'd
With variable complexions, all agreeing
In earnestness to see him. Seld-shown flamens
Do press among the popular throngs and puff
To win a vulgar station; our veil'd dames
Commit the war of white and damask in
Their nicely gawded cheeks to th' wanton spoil
Of Phoebus' burning kisses. Such a pother,
As if that whatsoever god who leads him
Were slily crept into his human powers,
And gave him graceful posture.
Then our office may
During his power go sleep.
In that there's comfort.
I heard him swear,
Were he to stand for consul, never would he
Appear i' th' market-place, nor on him put
The napless vesture of humility;
Nor, showing, as the manner is, his wounds
To th' people, beg their stinking breaths.
It was his word. O, he would miss it rather
Than carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him
And the desire of the nobles.
'Tis most like he will.
So it must fall out
To him or our authorities. For an end,
We must suggest the people in what hatred
He still hath held them; that to's power he would
Have made them mules, silenc'd their pleaders, and
Dispropertied their freedoms; holding them
In human action and capacity
Of no more soul nor fitness for the world
Than camels in their war, who have their provand
Only for bearing burdens, and sore blows
For sinking under them.
What's the matter?
Let's to the Capitol,
And carry with us ears and eyes for th' time,
But hearts for the event.
Which the rather
We shall be bless'd to do, if he remember
A kinder value of the people than
He hath hereto priz'd them at.
Most willingly.
But yet my caution was more pertinent
Than the rebuke you give it.
Sir, I hope
My words disbench'd you not.
Mark you that?
You see how he intends to use the people.
Come, we'll inform them
Of our proceedings here. On th' market-place
I know they do attend us.                             Exeunt
We stay here for the people.
With a proud heart he wore
His humble weeds. Will you dismiss the people?
                        Re-enter citizens
We pray the gods he may deserve your loves.
Could you not have told him-
As you were lesson'd- when he had no power
But was a petty servant to the state,
He was your enemy; ever spake against
Your liberties and the charters that you bear
I' th' body of the weal; and now, arriving
A place of potency and sway o' th' state,
If he should still malignantly remain
Fast foe to th' plebeii, your voices might
Be curses to yourselves? You should have said
That as his worthy deeds did claim no less
Than what he stood for, so his gracious nature
Would think upon you for your voices, and
Translate his malice towards you into love,
Standing your friendly lord.
Did you perceive
He did solicit you in free contempt
When he did need your loves; and do you think
That his contempt shall not be bruising to you
When he hath power to crush? Why, had your bodies
No heart among you? Or had you tongues to cry
Against the rectorship of judgment?
Get you hence instantly, and tell those friends
They have chose a consul that will from them take
Their liberties, make them of no more voice
Than dogs, that are as often beat for barking
As therefore kept to do so.
Lay
A fault on us, your tribunes, that we labour'd,
No impediment between, but that you must
Cast your election on him.
Ay, spare us not. Say we read lectures to you,
How youngly he began to serve his country,
How long continued; and what stock he springs of-
The noble house o' th' Marcians; from whence came
That Ancus Marcius, Numa's daughter's son,
Who, after great Hostilius, here was king;
Of the same house Publius and Quintus were,
That our best water brought by conduits hither;
And Censorinus, nobly named so,
Twice being by the people chosen censor,
Was his great ancestor.
Say you ne'er had done't-
Harp on that still- but by our putting on;
And presently, when you have drawn your number,
Repair to th' Capitol.
Let them go on;
This mutiny were better put in hazard
Than stay, past doubt, for greater.
If, as his nature is, he fall in rage
With their refusal, both observe and answer
The vantage of his anger.
It will be dangerous to go on- no further.
Cominius, no.
The people are incens'd against him.
Call't not a plot.
The people cry you mock'd them; and of late,
When corn was given them gratis, you repin'd;
Scandal'd the suppliants for the people, call'd them
Time-pleasers, flatterers, foes to nobleness.
Not to them all.
How? I inform them!
Not unlike
Each way to better yours.
You speak o' th' people
As if you were a god, to punish; not
A man of their infirmity.
Why shall the people give
One that speaks thus their voice?
Enough, with over measure.
Has said enough.
Manifest treason!
The aediles, ho!
                       Enter an AEDILE
Let him be apprehended.
Seize him, aediles.
PLEBEIANS. Down with him! down with him!
By the consent of all we were establish'd
The people's magistrates.
Or let us stand to our authority
Or let us lose it. We do here pronounce,
Upon the part o' th' people, in whose power
We were elected theirs: Marcius is worthy
Of present death.
AEdiles, seize him.
Sir, those cold ways,
That seem like prudent helps, are very poisonous
Where the disease is violent. Lay hands upon him
And bear him to the rock.
                                [CORIOLANUS draws his sword]
Lay hands upon him.
He consul!
Merely awry. When he did love his country,
It honour'd him.
We'll hear no more.
Pursue him to his house and pluck him thence,
Lest his infection, being of catching nature,
Spread further.
If it were so-
Go not home.
In this point charge him home, that he affects
Tyrannical power. If he evade us there,
Enforce him with his envy to the people,
And that the spoil got on the Antiates
Was ne'er distributed.
                       Enter an AEDILE
What, will he come?
How accompanied?
And when such time they have begun to cry,
Let them not cease, but with a din confus'd
Enforce the present execution
Of what we chance to sentence.
Go about it.                               Exit AEDILE
Put him to choler straight. He hath been us'd
Ever to conquer, and to have his worth
Of contradiction; being once chaf'd, he cannot
Be rein'd again to temperance; then he speaks
What's in his heart, and that is there which looks
With us to break his neck.
      Enter CORIOLANUS, MENENIUS and COMINIUS, with others
But since he hath
Serv'd well for Rome-
I talk of that that know it.
There's no more to be said, but he is banish'd,
As enemy to the people and his country.
It shall be so.
Now we have shown our power,
Let us seem humbler after it is done
Than when it was a-doing.
Dismiss them home.                         Exit AEDILE
Here comes his mother.
               Enter VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA, and MENENIUS
Why?
They have ta'en note of us; keep on your way.
I would he had.
Pray, let's go.
Well, well, we'll leave you.
We stood to't in good time. Is this Menenius?
God-den to you all, god-den to you an.
Farewell, kind neighbours; we wish'd Coriolanus
Had lov'd you as we did.
Caius Marcius was
A worthy officer i' the war, but insolent,
O'ercome with pride, ambitious past all thinking,
Self-loving-
The gods have well prevented it, and Rome
Sits safe and still without him.
                         Enter an AEDILE
Go see this rumourer whipp'd. It cannot be
The Volsces dare break with us.
Not Possible.
                       Enter A MESSENGER
Rais'd only that the weaker sort may wish
Good Marcius home again.
But is this true, sir?
I do not like this news.
Let's to the Capitol. Would half my wealth
Would buy this for a lie!
Only make trial what your love can do
For Rome, towards Marcius.
You know the very road into his kindness
And cannot lose your way.
