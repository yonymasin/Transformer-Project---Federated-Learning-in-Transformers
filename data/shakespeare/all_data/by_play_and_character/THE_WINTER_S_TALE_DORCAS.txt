Mopsa must be your mistress; marry, garlic,
To mend her kissing with!
He hath promis'd you more than that, or there be liars.
Bless me from marrying a usurer!
Is it true too, think you?
We had the tune on't a month ago.
   Whither?
       Whither?
   Me too! Let me go thither
   If to either, thou dost ill.
   What, neither?
   Thou hast sworn my love to be.
