Let's hear our tribune. Peace! Speak, speak, speak.
True,
The people are the city.
You so remain.
Yield, Marcius, yield.
Down with him, down with him!
                  [In this mutiny the TRIBUNES, the AEDILES,
                                 and the people are beat in]
He shall, sure on't.
No, no, no, no, no.
To th' rock, to th' rock, with him!
It shall be so, it shall be so! Let him away!
He's banish'd, and it shall be so.
It shall be so, it shall be so.
Our enemy is banish'd, he is gone! Hoo-oo!
Come, come, let's see him out at gates; come!
The gods preserve our noble tribunes! Come.           Exeunt
Faith, we hear fearful news.
