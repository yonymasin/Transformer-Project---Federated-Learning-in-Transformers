There's strange news come, sir.
Caesar and Lepidus have made wars upon Pompey.
Caesar, having made use of him in the wars 'gainst Pompey,
presently denied him rivality, would not let him partake in the
glory of the action; and not resting here, accuses him of letters
he had formerly wrote to Pompey; upon his own appeal, seizes him.
So the poor third is up, till death enlarge his confine.
He's walking in the garden- thus, and spurns
The rush that lies before him; cries 'Fool Lepidus!'
And threats the throat of that his officer
That murd'red Pompey.
For Italy and Caesar. More, Domitius:
My lord desires you presently; my news
I might have told hereafter.
Come, sir.                                        Exeunt

Sir, the Queen.
Briefly, sir.
Sir, his chests and treasure
He has not with him.
They are beaten, sir, and our advantage serves
For a fair victory.
Ay, noble lord.
Ay, my lord.
It does, my lord.
What would my lord?
The gods withhold me!
Shall I do that which all the Parthian darts,
Though enemy, lost aim and could not?
I would not see't.
O, sir, pardon me!
Turn from me then that noble countenance,
Wherein the worship of the whole world lies.
My sword is drawn.
My dear master,
My captain and my emperor, let me say,
Before I strike this bloody stroke, farewell.
Farewell, great chief. Shall I strike now?
Why, there then! Thus do I escape the sorrow
Of Antony's death.                            [Kills himself
