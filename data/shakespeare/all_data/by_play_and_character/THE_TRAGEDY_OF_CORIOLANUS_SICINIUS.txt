Was ever man so proud as is this Marcius?
When we were chosen tribunes for the people-
Nay, but his taunts!
Bemock the modest moon.
Such a nature,
Tickled with good success, disdains the shadow
Which he treads on at noon. But I do wonder
His insolence can brook to be commanded
Under Cominius.
Besides, if things go well,
Opinion, that so sticks on Marcius, shall
Of his demerits rob Cominius.
Let's hence and hear
How the dispatch is made, and in what fashion,
More than his singularity, he goes
Upon this present action.
Nature teaches beasts to know their friends.
The lamb.
Especially in pride.
Menenius, you are known well enough too.
On the sudden
I warrant him consul.
He cannot temp'rately transport his honours
From where he should begin and end, but will
Lose those he hath won.
Doubt not
The commoners, for whom we stand, but they
Upon their ancient malice will forget
With the least cause these his new honours; which
That he will give them make I as little question
As he is proud to do't.
'Tis right.
I wish no better
Than have him hold that purpose, and to put it
In execution.
It shall be to him then as our good wills:
A sure destruction.
This, as you say, suggested
At some time when his soaring insolence
Shall touch the people- which time shall not want,
If he be put upon't, and that's as easy
As to set dogs on sheep- will be his fire
To kindle their dry stubble; and their blaze
Shall darken him for ever.
                       Enter A MESSENGER
Have with you.                                Exeunt
We are convented
Upon a pleasing treaty, and have hearts
Inclinable to honour and advance
The theme of our assembly.
Sir, the people
Must have their voices; neither will they bate
One jot of ceremony.
May they perceive's intent! He will require them
As if he did contemn what he requested
Should be in them to give.
The custom of request you have discharg'd.
The people do admit you, and are summon'd
To meet anon, upon your approbation.
There, Coriolanus.
You may, sir.
Fare you well.
                              Exeunt CORIOLANUS and MENENIUS
He has it now; and by his looks methinks
'Tis warm at's heart.
How now, my masters! Have you chose this man?
Why, so he did, I am sure.
Why either were you ignorant to see't,
Or, seeing it, of such childish friendliness
To yield your voices?
Thus to have said,
As you were fore-advis'd, had touch'd his spirit
And tried his inclination; from him pluck'd
Either his gracious promise, which you might,
As cause had call'd you up, have held him to;
Or else it would have gall'd his surly nature,
Which easily endures not article
Tying him to aught. So, putting him to rage,
You should have ta'en th' advantage of his choler
And pass'd him unelected.
Have you
Ere now denied the asker, and now again,
Of him that did not ask but mock, bestow
Your su'd-for tongues?
Let them assemble;
And, on a safer judgment, all revoke
Your ignorant election. Enforce his pride
And his old hate unto you; besides, forget not
With what contempt he wore the humble weed;
How in his suit he scorn'd you; but your loves,
Thinking upon his services, took from you
Th' apprehension of his present portance,
Which, most gibingly, ungravely, he did fashion
After the inveterate hate he bears you.
Say you chose him
More after our commandment than as guided
By your own true affections; and that your minds,
Pre-occupied with what you rather must do
Than what you should, made you against the grain
To voice him consul. Lay the fault on us.
One thus descended,
That hath beside well in his person wrought
To be set high in place, we did commend
To your remembrances; but you have found,
Scaling his present bearing with his past,
That he's your fixed enemy, and revoke
Your sudden approbation.
To th' Capitol, come.
We will be there before the stream o' th' people;
And this shall seem, as partly 'tis, their own,
Which we have goaded onward.                          Exeunt
Pass no further.
Stop,
Or all will fall in broil.
You show too much of that
For which the people stir; if you will pass
To where you are bound, you must enquire your way,
Which you are out of, with a gentler spirit,
Or never be so noble as a consul,
Nor yoke with him for tribune.
'Twere well
We let the people know't.
It is a mind
That shall remain a poison where it is,
Not poison any further.
Has spoken like a traitor and shall answer
As traitors do.
This a consul? No.
Go call the people,  [Exit AEDILE]  in whose name myself
Attach thee as a traitorous innovator,
A foe to th' public weal. Obey, I charge thee,
And follow to thine answer.
Help, ye citizens!
          Enter a rabble of plebeians, with the AEDILES
Here's he that would take from you all your power.
Hear me, people; peace!
You are at point to lose your liberties.
Marcius would have all from you; Marcius,
Whom late you have nam'd for consul.
What is the city but the people?
This deserves death.
Therefore lay hold of him;
Bear him to th' rock Tarpeian, and from thence
Into destruction cast him.
Where is this viper
That would depopulate the city and
Be every man himself?
He shall be thrown down the Tarpeian rock
With rigorous hands; he hath resisted law,
And therefore law shall scorn him further trial
Than the severity of the public power,
Which he so sets at nought.
Peace!
Sir, how comes't that you
Have holp to make this rescue?
Consul! What consul?
Speak briefly, then,
For we are peremptory to dispatch
This viperous traitor; to eject him hence
Were but one danger, and to keep him here
Our certain death; therefore it is decreed
He dies to-night.
He's a disease that must be cut away.
This is clean kam.
The service of the foot,
Being once gangren'd, is not then respected
For what before it was.
What do ye talk?
Have we not had a taste of his obedience-
Our aediles smote, ourselves resisted? Come!
Noble Menenius,
Be you then as the people's officer.
Masters, lay down your weapons.
Meet on the market-place. We'll attend you there;
Where, if you bring not Marcius, we'll proceed
In our first way.
Have you a catalogue
Of all the voices that we have procur'd,
Set down by th' poll?
Have you corrected them by tribes?
Assemble presently the people hither;
And when they hear me say 'It shall be so
I' th' right and strength o' th' commons' be it either
For death, for fine, or banishment, then let them,
If I say fine, cry 'Fine!'- if death, cry 'Death!'
Insisting on the old prerogative
And power i' th' truth o' th' cause.
Make them be strong, and ready for this hint,
When we shall hap to give't them.
Well, here he comes.
Draw near, ye people.
I do demand,
If you submit you to the people's voices,
Allow their officers, and are content
To suffer lawful censure for such faults
As shall be prov'd upon you.
Answer to us.
We charge you that you have contriv'd to take
From Rome all season'd office, and to wind
Yourself into a power tyrannical;
For which you are a traitor to the people.
Mark you this, people?
Peace!
We need not put new matter to his charge.
What you have seen him do and heard him speak,
Beating your officers, cursing yourselves,
Opposing laws with strokes, and here defying
Those whose great power must try him- even this,
So criminal and in such capital kind,
Deserves th' extremest death.
For that he has-
As much as in him lies- from time to time
Envied against the people, seeking means
To pluck away their power; as now at last
Given hostile strokes, and that not in the presence
Of dreaded justice, but on the ministers
That do distribute it- in the name o' th' people,
And in the power of us the tribunes, we,
Ev'n from this instant, banish him our city,
In peril of precipitation
From off the rock Tarpeian, never more
To enter our Rome gates. I' th' people's name,
I say it shall be so.
He's sentenc'd; no more hearing.
We know your drift. Speak what?
Go see him out at gates, and follow him,
As he hath follow'd you, with all despite;
Give him deserv'd vexation. Let a guard
Attend us through the city.
Bid them all home; he's gone, and we'll no further.
The nobility are vex'd, whom we see have sided
In his behalf.
Bid them home.
Say their great enemy is gone, and they
Stand in their ancient strength.
Let's not meet her.
They say she's mad.
Are you mankind?
O blessed heavens!
What then?
I would he had continued to his country
As he began, and not unknit himself
The noble knot he made.
Why stay we to be baited
With one that wants her wits?                Exeunt TRIBUNES
We hear not of him, neither need we fear him.
His remedies are tame. The present peace
And quietness of the people, which before
Were in wild hurry, here do make his friends
Blush that the world goes well; who rather had,
Though they themselves did suffer by't, behold
Dissentious numbers pest'ring streets than see
Our tradesmen singing in their shops, and going
About their functions friendly.
                      Enter MENENIUS
'Tis he, 'tis he. O, he is grown most kind
Of late. Hail, sir!
Your Coriolanus is not much miss'd
But with his friends. The commonwealth doth stand,
And so would do, were he more angry at it.
Where is he, hear you?
God-den, our neighbours.
Live and thrive!
This is a happier and more comely time
Than when these fellows ran about the streets
Crying confusion.
And affecting one sole throne,
Without assistance.
We should by this, to all our lamentation,
If he had gone forth consul, found it so.
Come, what talk you of Marcius?
Tell not me.
I know this cannot be.
'Tis this slave-
Go whip him fore the people's eyes- his raising,
Nothing but his report.
What more fearful?
This is most likely!
The very trick on 't.
Go, masters, get you be not dismay'd;
These are a side that would be glad to have
This true which they so seem to fear. Go home,
And show no sign of fear.
Nor I.
Pray let's go.                                Exeunt
Nay, pray be patient; if you refuse your aid
In this so never-needed help, yet do not
Upbraid's with our distress. But sure, if you
Would be your country's pleader, your good tongue,
More than the instant army we can make,
Might stop our countryman.
Pray you go to him.
Yet your good will
Must have that thanks from Rome after the measure
As you intended well.
Not?
Why, what of that?
Is't possible that so short a time can alter the
condition of a man?
He lov'd his mother dearly.
Yes- mercy, if you report him truly.
The gods be good unto us!
What's the news?
Friend,
Art thou certain this is true? Is't most certain?
First, the gods bless you for your tidings; next,
Accept my thankfulness.
They are near the city?
We'll meet them,
And help the joy.                                     Exeunt
