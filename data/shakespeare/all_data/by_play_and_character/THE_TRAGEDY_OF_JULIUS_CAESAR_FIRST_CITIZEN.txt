I will hear Brutus speak.
Bring him with triumph home unto his house.
We'll bring him to his house with shouts and
clamors.
Peace, ho!
Stay, ho, and let us hear Mark Antony.
This Caesar was a tyrant.
Methinks there is much reason in his sayings.
If it be found so, some will dear abide it.
Stand from the hearse, stand from the body.
O piteous spectacle!
O most bloody sight!
Peace there! Hear the noble Antony.
We'll burn the house of Brutus.
Never, never. Come, away, away!
We'll burn his body in the holy place
And with the brands fire the traitors' houses.
Take up the body.
What is your name?
Ay, and briefly.
As a friend or an enemy?
Tear him to pieces, he's a conspirator.
