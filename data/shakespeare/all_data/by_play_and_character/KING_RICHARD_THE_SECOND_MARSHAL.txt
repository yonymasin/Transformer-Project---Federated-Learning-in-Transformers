My Lord Aumerle, is Harry Hereford arm'd?
The Duke of Norfolk, spightfully and bold,
Stays but the summons of the appelant's trumpet.
In God's name and the King's, say who thou art,
And why thou comest thus knightly clad in arms;
Against what man thou com'st, and what thy quarrel.
Speak truly on thy knighthood and thy oath;
As so defend thee heaven and thy valour!
What is thy name? and wherefore com'st thou hither
Before King Richard in his royal lists?
Against whom comest thou? and what's thy quarrel?
Speak like a true knight, so defend thee heaven!
On pain of death, no person be so bold
Or daring-hardy as to touch the lists,
Except the Marshal and such officers
Appointed to direct these fair designs.
The appellant in all duty greets your Highness,
And craves to kiss your hand and take his leave.
Harry of Hereford, Lancaster, and Derby,
Receive thy lance; and God defend the right!
[To an officer] Go bear this lance to Thomas,
  Duke of Norfolk.
Sound trumpets; and set forward, combatants.
                                       [A charge sounded]
Stay, the King hath thrown his warder down.
My lord, no leave take I, for I will ride
As far as land will let me by your side.
