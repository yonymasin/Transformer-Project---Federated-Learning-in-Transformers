How now, brother Edmund? What serious contemplation are you
 in?
Do you busy yourself with that?
How long have you been a sectary astronomical?
The night gone by.
Ay, two hours together.
None at all.
Some villain hath done me wrong.
Arm'd, brother?
Shall I hear from you anon?
I am sure on't, not a word.
I heard myself proclaim'd,
 And by the happy hollow of a tree
 Escap'd the hunt. No port is free, no place
 That guard and most unusual vigilance
 Does not attend my taking. Whiles I may scape,
 I will preserve myself; and am bethought
 To take the basest and most poorest shape
 That ever penury, in contempt of man,
 Brought near to beast. My face I'll grime with filth,
 Blanket my loins, elf all my hair in knots,
 And with presented nakedness outface
 The winds and persecutions of the sky.
 The country gives me proof and precedent
 Of Bedlam beggars, who, with roaring voices,
 Strike in their numb'd and mortified bare arms
 Pins, wooden pricks, nails, sprigs of rosemary;
 And with this horrible object, from low farms,
 Poor pelting villages, sheepcotes, and mills,
 Sometime with lunatic bans, sometime with prayers,
 Enforce their charity. 'Poor Turlygod! poor Tom!'
 That's something yet! Edgar I nothing am.             Exit.
[within] Fathom and half, fathom and half! Poor Tom!
                 Enter Fool [from the hovel].
Away! the foul fiend follows me! Through the sharp hawthorn
 blows the cold wind. Humh! go to thy cold bed, and warm thee.
Who gives anything to poor Tom? whom the foul fiend hath led
 through fire and through flame, through ford and whirlpool, o'er
 bog and quagmire; that hath laid knives under his pillow and
 halters in his pew, set ratsbane by his porridge, made him proud
 of heart, to ride on a bay trotting horse over four-inch'd
 bridges, to course his own shadow for a traitor. Bless thy five
 wits! Tom 's acold. O, do de, do de, do de. Bless thee from
 whirlwinds, star-blasting, and taking! Do poor Tom some charity,
 whom the foul fiend vexes. There could I have him now- and there-
 and there again- and there!
                                                Storm still.
Pillicock sat on Pillicock's Hill. 'Allow, 'allow, loo, loo!
Take heed o' th' foul fiend; obey thy parents: keep thy word
 justly; swear not; commit not with man's sworn spouse; set not
 thy sweet heart on proud array. Tom 's acold.
A servingman, proud in heart and mind; that curl'd my hair,
 wore gloves in my cap; serv'd the lust of my mistress' heart and
 did the act of darkness with her; swore as many oaths as I spake
 words, and broke them in the sweet face of heaven; one that
 slept in the contriving of lust, and wak'd to do it. Wine lov'd
 I deeply, dice dearly; and in woman out-paramour'd the Turk.
 False of heart, light of ear, bloody of hand; hog in sloth, fox
 in stealth, wolf in greediness, dog in madness, lion in prey.
 Let not the creaking of shoes nor the rustling of silks betray
 thy poor heart to woman. Keep thy foot out of brothel, thy hand
 out of placket, thy pen from lender's book, and defy the foul
 fiend. Still through the hawthorn blows the cold wind; says
 suum, mun, hey, no, nonny. Dolphin my boy, my boy, sessa! let
 him trot by.
                                                Storm still.
This is the foul fiend Flibbertigibbet. He begins at curfew,
 and walks till the first cock. He gives the web and the pin,
 squints the eye, and makes the harelip; mildews the white wheat,
 and hurts the poor creature of earth.
       Saint Withold footed thrice the 'old;
       He met the nightmare, and her nine fold;
          Bid her alight
          And her troth plight,
       And aroint thee, witch, aroint thee!
Poor Tom, that eats the swimming frog, the toad, the todpole,
 the wall-newt and the water; that in the fury of his heart, when
 the foul fiend rages, eats cow-dung for sallets, swallows the
 old rat and the ditch-dog, drinks the green mantle of the
 standing pool; who is whipp'd from tithing to tithing, and
 stock-punish'd and imprison'd; who hath had three suits to his
 back, six shirts to his body, horse to ride, and weapons to
 wear;
      But mice and rats, and such small deer,
      Have been Tom's food for seven long year.
 Beware my follower. Peace, Smulkin! peace, thou fiend!
The prince of darkness is a gentleman!
 Modo he's call'd, and Mahu.
Poor Tom 's acold.
How to prevent the fiend and to kill vermin.
Tom's acold.
Child Rowland to the dark tower came;
 His word was still
      Fie, foh, and fum!
      I smell the blood of a British man.
                                                     Exeunt.
Frateretto calls me, and tells me Nero is an angler in the
 lake of darkness. Pray, innocent, and beware the foul fiend.
The foul fiend bites my back.
Look, where he stands and glares! Want'st thou eyes at trial,
 madam?
         Come o'er the bourn, Bessy, to me.
The foul fiend haunts poor Tom in the voice of a nightingale.
 Hoppedance cries in Tom's belly for two white herring. Croak
 not, black angel; I have no food for thee.
Let us deal justly.
      Sleepest or wakest thou, jolly shepherd?
        Thy sheep be in the corn;
      And for one blast of thy minikin mouth
        Thy sheep shall take no harm.
 Purr! the cat is gray.
Bless thy five wits!
[aside] My tears begin to take his part so much
 They'll mar my counterfeiting.
Tom will throw his head at them. Avaunt, you curs!
       Be thy mouth or black or white,
       Tooth that poisons if it bite;
       Mastiff, greyhound, mongrel grim,
       Hound or spaniel, brach or lym,
       Bobtail tyke or trundle-tall-
       Tom will make them weep and wail;
       For, with throwing thus my head,
       Dogs leap the hatch, and all are fled.
 Do de, de, de. Sessa! Come, march to wakes and fairs and market
 towns. Poor Tom, thy horn is dry.
When we our betters see bearing our woes,
 We scarcely think our miseries our foes.
 Who alone suffers suffers most i' th' mind,
 Leaving free things and happy shows behind;
 But then the mind much sufferance doth o'erskip
 When grief hath mates, and bearing fellowship.
 How light and portable my pain seems now,
 When that which makes me bend makes the King bow,
 He childed as I fathered! Tom, away!
 Mark the high noises, and thyself bewray
 When false opinion, whose wrong thought defiles thee,
 In thy just proof repeals and reconciles thee.
 What will hap more to-night, safe scape the King!
 Lurk, lurk.                                         [Exit.]
Yet better thus, and known to be contemn'd,
 Than still contemn'd and flatter'd. To be worst,
 The lowest and most dejected thing of fortune,
 Stands still in esperance, lives not in fear.
 The lamentable change is from the best;
 The worst returns to laughter. Welcome then,
 Thou unsubstantial air that I embrace!
 The wretch that thou hast blown unto the worst
 Owes nothing to thy blasts.
             Enter Gloucester, led by an Old Man.
 But who comes here?
 My father, poorly led? World, world, O world!
 But that thy strange mutations make us hate thee,
 Life would not yield to age.
[aside] O gods! Who is't can say 'I am at the worst'?
 I am worse than e'er I was.
[aside] And worse I may be yet. The worst is not
 So long as we can say 'This is the worst.'
[aside] How should this be?
 Bad is the trade that must play fool to sorrow,
 Ang'ring itself and others.- Bless thee, master!
Poor Tom's acold. [Aside] I cannot daub it further.
[aside] And yet I must.- Bless thy sweet eyes, they bleed.
Both stile and gate, horseway and footpath. Poor Tom hath been
 scar'd out of his good wits. Bless thee, good man's son, from
 the foul fiend! Five fiends have been in poor Tom at once: of
 lust, as Obidicut; Hobbididence, prince of dumbness; Mahu, of
 stealing; Modo, of murder; Flibbertigibbet, of mopping and
 mowing, who since possesses chambermaids and waiting women. So,
 bless thee, master!
Ay, master.
Give me thy arm.
 Poor Tom shall lead thee.
                                                     Exeunt.
You do climb up it now. Look how we labour.
Horrible steep.
 Hark, do you hear the sea?
Why, then, your other senses grow imperfect
 By your eyes' anguish.
Y'are much deceiv'd. In nothing am I chang'd
 But in my garments.
Come on, sir; here's the place. Stand still. How fearful
 And dizzy 'tis to cast one's eyes so low!
 The crows and choughs that wing the midway air
 Show scarce so gross as beetles. Halfway down
 Hangs one that gathers sampire- dreadful trade!
 Methinks he seems no bigger than his head.
 The fishermen that walk upon the beach
 Appear like mice; and yond tall anchoring bark,
 Diminish'd to her cock; her cock, a buoy
 Almost too small for sight. The murmuring surge
 That on th' unnumb'red idle pebble chafes
 Cannot be heard so high. I'll look no more,
 Lest my brain turn, and the deficient sight
 Topple down headlong.
Give me your hand. You are now within a foot
 Of th' extreme verge. For all beneath the moon
 Would I not leap upright.
Now fare ye well, good sir.
[aside]. Why I do trifle thus with his despair
 Is done to cure it.
Gone, sir, farewell.-
 And yet I know not how conceit may rob
 The treasury of life when life itself
 Yields to the theft. Had he been where he thought,
 By this had thought been past.- Alive or dead?
 Ho you, sir! friend! Hear you, sir? Speak!-
 Thus might he pass indeed. Yet he revives.
 What are you, sir?
Hadst thou been aught but gossamer, feathers, air,
 So many fadom down precipitating,
 Thou'dst shiver'd like an egg; but thou dost breathe;
 Hast heavy substance; bleed'st not; speak'st; art sound.
 Ten masts at each make not the altitude
 Which thou hast perpendicularly fell.
 Thy life is a miracle. Speak yet again.
From the dread summit of this chalky bourn.
 Look up a-height. The shrill-gorg'd lark so far
 Cannot be seen or heard. Do but look up.
Give me your arm.
 Up- so. How is't? Feel you your legs? You stand.
This is above all strangeness.
 Upon the crown o' th' cliff what thing was that
 Which parted from you?
As I stood here below, methought his eyes
 Were two full moons; he had a thousand noses,
 Horns whelk'd and wav'd like the enridged sea.
 It was some fiend. Therefore, thou happy father,
 Think that the clearest gods, who make them honours
 Of men's impossibility, have preserv'd thee.
Bear free and patient thoughts.
     Enter Lear, mad, [fantastically dressed with weeds].
 But who comes here?
 The safer sense will ne'er accommodate
 His master thus.
O thou side-piercing sight!
Sweet marjoram.
[aside] I would not take this from report. It is,
 And my heart breaks at it.
O, matter and impertinency mix'd!
 Reason, in madness!
Hail, gentle sir.
Do you hear aught, sir, of a battle toward?
But, by your favour,
 How near's the other army?
I thank you sir. That's all.
I thank you, sir
                                           Exit [Gentleman].
Well pray you, father.
A most poor man, made tame to fortune's blows,
 Who, by the art of known and feeling sorrows,
 Am pregnant to good pity. Give me your hand;
 I'll lead you to some biding.
Chill not let go, zir, without vurther 'cagion.
Good gentleman, go your gait, and let poor voke pass. An chud
 ha' bin zwagger'd out of my life, 'twould not ha' bin zo long as
 'tis by a vortnight. Nay, come not near th' old man. Keep out,
 che vore ye, or Ise try whether your costard or my ballow be the
 harder. Chill be plain with you.
Chill pick your teeth, zir. Come! No matter vor your foins.
                                             [Oswald falls.]
I know thee well. A serviceable villain,
 As duteous to the vices of thy mistress
 As badness would desire.
Sit you down, father; rest you.
 Let's see his pockets; these letters that he speaks of
 May be my friends. He's dead. I am only sorry
 He had no other deathsman. Let us see.
 Leave, gentle wax; and, manners, blame us not.
 To know our enemies' minds, we'ld rip their hearts;
 Their papers, is more lawful.             Reads the letter.
   'Let our reciprocal vows be rememb'red. You have many
 opportunities to cut him off. If your will want not, time and
 place will be fruitfully offer'd. There is nothing done, if he
 return the conqueror. Then am I the prisoner, and his bed my
 jail; from the loathed warmth whereof deliver me, and supply the
 place for your labour.
       'Your (wife, so I would say) affectionate servant,
                                                      'Goneril.'
 O indistinguish'd space of woman's will!
 A plot upon her virtuous husband's life,
 And the exchange my brother! Here in the sands
 Thee I'll rake up, the post unsanctified
 Of murtherous lechers; and in the mature time
 With this ungracious paper strike the sight
 Of the death-practis'd Duke, For him 'tis well
 That of thy death and business I can tell.
Give me your hand.
 Far off methinks I hear the beaten drum.
 Come, father, I'll bestow you with a friend.        Exeunt.
If e'er your Grace had speech with man so poor,
 Hear me one word.
Before you fight the battle, ope this letter.
 If you have victory, let the trumpet sound
 For him that brought it. Wretched though I seem,
 I can produce a champion that will prove
 What is avouched there. If you miscarry,
 Your business of the world hath so an end,
 And machination ceases. Fortune love you!
I was forbid it.
 When time shall serve, let but the herald cry,
 And I'll appear again.
Here, father, take the shadow of this tree
 For your good host. Pray that the right may thrive.
 If ever I return to you again,
 I'll bring you comfort.
Away, old man! give me thy hand! away!
 King Lear hath lost, he and his daughter ta'en.
 Give me thy hand! come on!
What, in ill thoughts again? Men must endure
 Their going hence, even as their coming hither;
 Ripeness is all. Come on.
Know my name is lost;
 By treason's tooth bare-gnawn and canker-bit.
 Yet am I noble as the adversary
 I come to cope.
What's he that speaks for Edmund Earl of Gloucester?
Draw thy sword,
 That, if my speech offend a noble heart,
 Thy arm may do thee justice. Here is mine.
 Behold, it is the privilege of mine honours,
 My oath, and my profession. I protest-
 Maugre thy strength, youth, place, and eminence,
 Despite thy victor sword and fire-new fortune,
 Thy valour and thy heart- thou art a traitor;
 False to thy gods, thy brother, and thy father;
 Conspirant 'gainst this high illustrious prince;
 And from th' extremest upward of thy head
 To the descent and dust beneath thy foot,
 A most toad-spotted traitor. Say thou 'no,'
 This sword, this arm, and my best spirits are bent
 To prove upon thy heart, whereto I speak,
 Thou liest.
Let's exchange charity.
 I am no less in blood than thou art, Edmund;
 If more, the more th' hast wrong'd me.
 My name is Edgar and thy father's son.
 The gods are just, and of our pleasant vices
 Make instruments to scourge us.
 The dark and vicious place where thee he got
 Cost him his eyes.
Worthy prince, I know't.
By nursing them, my lord. List a brief tale;
 And when 'tis told, O that my heart would burst!
 The bloody proclamation to escape
 That follow'd me so near (O, our lives' sweetness!
 That with the pain of death would hourly die
 Rather than die at once!) taught me to shift
 Into a madman's rags, t' assume a semblance
 That very dogs disdain'd; and in this habit
 Met I my father with his bleeding rings,
 Their precious stones new lost; became his guide,
 Led him, begg'd for him, sav'd him from despair;
 Never (O fault!) reveal'd myself unto him
 Until some half hour past, when I was arm'd,
 Not sure, though hoping of this good success,
 I ask'd his blessing, and from first to last
 Told him my pilgrimage. But his flaw'd heart
 (Alack, too weak the conflict to support!)
 'Twixt two extremes of passion, joy and grief,
 Burst smilingly.
This would have seem'd a period
 To such as love not sorrow; but another,
 To amplify too much, would make much more,
 And top extremity.
 Whilst I was big in clamour, came there a man,
 Who, having seen me in my worst estate,
 Shunn'd my abhorr'd society; but then, finding
 Who 'twas that so endur'd, with his strong arms
 He fastened on my neck, and bellowed out
 As he'd burst heaven; threw him on my father;
 Told the most piteous tale of Lear and him
 That ever ear receiv'd; which in recounting
 His grief grew puissant, and the strings of life
 Began to crack. Twice then the trumpets sounded,
 And there I left him tranc'd.
Kent, sir, the banish'd Kent; who in disguise
 Followed his enemy king and did him service
 Improper for a slave.
            Enter a Gentleman with a bloody knife.
What kind of help?
What means that bloody knife?
Here comes Kent.
To who, my lord? Who has the office? Send
 Thy token of reprieve.
Or image of that horror?
'Tis noble Kent, your friend.
Very bootless.
                       Enter a Captain.
He faints! My lord, my lord!
Look up, my lord.
He is gone indeed.
