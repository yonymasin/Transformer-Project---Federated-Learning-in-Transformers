[Presenting his petition] Against my master, Thomas Horner,
for saying that the Duke of York was rightful heir to the crown.
That my master was? No, forsooth. My master said that he
was, and that the King was an usurper.
[Holding up his hands] By these ten bones, my lords, he did
speak them to me in the garret one night, as we were scouring my
Lord of York's armour.
Alas, my lord, I cannot fight; for God's sake, pity my case!
The spite of man prevaileth against me. O Lord, have mercy upon
me, I shall never be able to fight a blow! O Lord, my heart!
I thank you all. Drink, and pray for me, I pray you; for I
think I have taken my last draught in this world. Here, Robin, an
if I die, I give thee my apron; and, Will, thou shalt have my
hammer; and here, Tom, take all the money that I have. O Lord
bless me, I pray God! for I am never able to deal with my master,
he hath learnt so much fence already.
Peter, forsooth.
Thump.
O God, have I overcome mine enemies in this presence? O
Peter, thou hast prevail'd in right!
