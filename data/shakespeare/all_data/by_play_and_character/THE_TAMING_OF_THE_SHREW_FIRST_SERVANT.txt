Will't please your lordship drink a cup of sack?
Say thou wilt course; thy greyhounds are as swift
As breathed stags; ay, fleeter than the roe.
And, till the tears that she hath shed for thee
Like envious floods o'er-run her lovely face,
She was the fairest creature in the world;
And yet she is inferior to none.
O, yes, my lord, but very idle words;
For though you lay here in this goodly chamber,
Yet would you say ye were beaten out of door;
And rail upon the hostess of the house,
And say you would present her at the leet,
Because she brought stone jugs and no seal'd quarts.
Sometimes you would call out for Cicely Hacket.
My lord, you nod; you do not mind the play.
Ay.
