Why, Belman is as good as he, my lord;
He cried upon it at the merest loss,
And twice to-day pick'd out the dullest scent;
Trust me, I take him for the better dog.
I will, my lord.
Believe me, lord, I think he cannot choose.
My lord, I warrant you we will play our part
As he shall think by our true diligence
He is no less than what we say he is.
