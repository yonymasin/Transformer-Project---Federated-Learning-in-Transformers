No, you shall paint when you are old.
There's a palm presages chastity, if nothing else.
Go, you wild bedfellow, you cannot soothsay.
But how, but how? Give me particulars.
Am I not an inch of fortune better than she?
Not in my husband's nose.
Amen. Dear goddess, hear that prayer of the people! For, as
it is a heartbreaking to see a handsome man loose-wiv'd, so it is
a deadly sorrow to behold a foul knave uncuckolded. Therefore,
dear Isis, keep decorum, and fortune him accordingly!
Do, most dear Queen.
Madam, O good Empress!
Go to him, madam, speak to him.
He is unqualitied with very shame.
She's dead too, our sovereign.
Madam!
Royal Egypt, Empress!
Royal Queen!
Finish, good lady; the bright day is done,
And we are for the dark.
The gods forbid!
O the good gods!
I'll never see't, for I am sure mine nails
Are stronger than mine eyes.
