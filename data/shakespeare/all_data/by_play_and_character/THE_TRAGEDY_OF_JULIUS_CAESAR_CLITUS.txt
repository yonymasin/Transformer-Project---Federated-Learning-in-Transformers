Statilius show'd the torchlight, but, my lord,
He came not back. He is or ta'en or slain.
What, I, my lord? No, not for all the world.
I'll rather kill myself.
O Dardanius!
What ill request did Brutus make to thee?
Now is that noble vessel full of grief,
That it runs over even at his eyes.
Fly, fly, my lord, there is no tarrying here.
Fly, my lord, fly.
