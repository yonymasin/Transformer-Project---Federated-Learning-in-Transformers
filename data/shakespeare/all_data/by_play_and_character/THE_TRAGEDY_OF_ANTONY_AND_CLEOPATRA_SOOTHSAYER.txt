Your will?
In nature's infinite book of secrecy
A little I can read.
I make not, but foresee.
You shall be yet far fairer than you are.
You shall be more beloving than beloved.
You shall outlive the lady whom you serve.
You have seen and prov'd a fairer former fortune
Than that which is to approach.
If every of your wishes had a womb,
And fertile every wish, a million.
Your fortunes are alike.
I have said.
Would I had never come from thence, nor you thither!
I see it in my motion, have it not in my tongue; but
yet hie you to Egypt again.
Caesar's.
Therefore, O Antony, stay not by his side.
Thy daemon, that thy spirit which keeps thee, is
Noble, courageous, high, unmatchable,
Where Caesar's is not; but near him thy angel
Becomes a fear, as being o'erpow'r'd. Therefore
Make space enough between you.
To none but thee; no more but when to thee.
If thou dost play with him at any game,
Thou art sure to lose; and of that natural luck
He beats thee 'gainst the odds. Thy lustre thickens
When he shines by. I say again, thy spirit
Is all afraid to govern thee near him;
But, he away, 'tis noble.
