Peace, ho! No outrage- peace!
The man is noble, and his fame folds in
This orb o' th' earth. His last offences to us
Shall have judicious hearing. Stand, Aufidius,
And trouble not the peace.
Thou hast done a deed whereat valour will weep.
His own impatience
Takes from Aufidius a great part of blame.
Let's make the best of it.
