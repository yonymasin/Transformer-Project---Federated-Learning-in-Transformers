We are for you; sit i' th' middle.
I'faith, i'faith; and both in a tune, like two gipsies
on a horse.
                  SONG.
    It was a lover and his lass,
      With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,
    That o'er the green corn-field did pass
      In the spring time, the only pretty ring time,
    When birds do sing, hey ding a ding, ding.
    Sweet lovers love the spring.
    Between the acres of the rye,
      With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,
    These pretty country folks would lie,
      In the spring time, &c.
    This carol they began that hour,
      With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,
    How that a life was but a flower,
      In the spring time, &c.
    And therefore take the present time,
      With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,
    For love is crowned with the prime,
      In the spring time, &c.
