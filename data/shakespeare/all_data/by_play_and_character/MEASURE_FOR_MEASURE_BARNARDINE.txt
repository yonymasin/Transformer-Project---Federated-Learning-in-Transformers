[Within] A pox o' your throats! Who makes that noise
there? What are you?
[ Within ] Away, you rogue, away; I am sleepy.
How now, Abhorson, what's the news with you?
You rogue, I have been drinking all night; I am not
fitted for't.
Friar, not I; I have been drinking hard all night, and
I will have more time to prepare me, or they shall beat out my
brains with billets. I will not consent to die this day, that's
certain.
I swear I will not die to-day for any man's persuasion.
Not a word; if you have anything to say to me, come to
my ward; for thence will not I to-day.                  Exit
