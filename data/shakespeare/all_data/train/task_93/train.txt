Sir, you have sav'd my longing, and I feed Most hungerly on your sight. My heart is ever at your service, my lord. So they were bleeding new, my lord, there's no meat like 'em; I could wish my best friend at such a feast. Ay, defil'd land, my lord. Honour, health, and compassion, to the Senate! I am an humble suitor to your virtues; For pity is the virtue of the law, And none but tyrants use it cruelly. It pleases time and fortune to lie heavy Upon a friend of mine, who in hot blood Hath stepp'd into the law, which is past depth To those that without heed do plunge into't. He is a man, setting his fate aside, Of comely virtues; Nor did he soil the fact with cowardice- An honour in him which buys out his fault- But with a noble fury and fair spirit, Seeing his reputation touch'd to death, He did oppose his foe; And with such sober and unnoted passion He did behove his anger ere 'twas spent, As if he had but prov'd an argument. My lord- My lords, then, under favour, pardon me If I speak like a captain: Why do fond men expose themselves to battle, And not endure all threats? Sleep upon't, And let the foes quietly cut their throats, Without repugnancy? If there be Such valour in the bearing, what make we Abroad? Why, then, women are more valiant, That stay at home, if bearing carry it; And the ass more captain than the lion; the fellow Loaden with irons wiser than the judge, If wisdom be in suffering. O my lords, As you are great, be pitifully good. Who cannot condemn rashness in cold blood? To kill, I grant, is sin's extremest gust; But, in defence, by mercy, 'tis most just. To be in anger is impiety; But who is man that is not angry? Weigh but the crime with this. In vain! His service done At Lacedaemon and Byzantium Were a sufficient briber for his life. Why, I say, my lords, has done fair service, And slain in fight many of your enemies; How full of valour did he bear himself In the last conflict, and made plenteous wounds! Hard fate! He might have died in war. My lords, if not for any parts in him- Though his right arm might purchase his own time, And be in debt to none- yet, more to move you, Take my deserts to his, and join 'em both; And, for I know your reverend ages love Security, I'll pawn my victories, all My honours to you, upon his good returns. If by this crime he owes the law his life, Why, let the war receive't in valiant gore; For law is strict, and war is nothing more. Must it be so? It must not be. My lords, I do beseech you, know me. Call me to your remembrances. I cannot think but your age has forgot me; It could not else be I should prove so base To sue, and be denied such common grace. My wounds ache at you. Banish me! Banish your dotage! Banish usury That makes the Senate ugly. Now the gods keep you old enough that you may live Only in bone, that none may look on you! I'm worse than mad; I have kept back their foes, While they have told their money and let out Their coin upon large interest, I myself Rich only in large hurts. All those for this? Is this the balsam that the usuring Senate Pours into captains' wounds? Banishment! It comes not ill; I hate not to be banish'd; It is a cause worthy my spleen and fury, That I may strike at Athens. I'll cheer up My discontented troops, and lay for hearts. 'Tis honour with most lands to be at odds; Soldiers should brook as little wrongs as gods. Exit What art thou there? Speak. What is thy name? Is man so hateful to thee That art thyself a man? I know thee well; But in thy fortunes am unlearn'd and strange. How came the noble Timon to this change? Noble Timon, What friendship may I do thee? What is it, Timon? I have heard in some sort of thy miseries. I see them now; then was a blessed time. Pardon him, sweet Timandra, for his wits Are drown'd and lost in his calamities. I have but little gold of late, brave Timon, The want whereof doth daily make revolt In my penurious band. I have heard, and griev'd, How cursed Athens, mindless of thy worth, Forgetting thy great deeds, when neighbour states, But for thy sword and fortune, trod upon them- I am thy friend, and pity thee, dear Timon. Why, fare thee well; Here is some gold for thee. When I have laid proud Athens on a heap- Ay, Timon, and have cause. Why me, Timon? Hast thou gold yet? I'll take the gold thou givest me, Not all thy counsel. Strike up the drum towards Athens. Farewell, Timon; If I thrive well, I'll visit thee again. I never did thee harm. Call'st thou that harm?
