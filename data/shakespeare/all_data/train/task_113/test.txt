Hast thou forgot thyself? Is it so long? Call forth the holy father. Exit an ATTENDANT Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay. Ay, husband; can he that deny? Alas, it is the baseness of thy fear That makes thee strangle thy propriety. Fear not, Cesario, take thy fortunes up; Be that thou know'st thou art, and then thou art As great as that thou fear'st.  Enter PRIEST O, welcome, father! Father, I charge thee, by thy reverence, Here to unfold- though lately we intended To keep in darkness what occasion now Reveals before 'tis ripe- what thou dost know Hath newly pass'd between this youth and me. O, do not swear! Hold little faith, though thou has too much fear.  Enter SIR ANDREW What's the matter? Who has done this, Sir Andrew? Away with him. Who hath made this havoc with them? Get him to bed, and let his hurt be look'd to.  Exeunt CLOWN, FABIAN, SIR TOBY, and SIR ANDREW  Enter SEBASTIAN Most wonderful! He shall enlarge him. Fetch Malvolio hither; And yet, alas, now I remember me, They say, poor gentleman, he's much distract.  Re-enter CLOWN, with a letter, and FABIAN A most extracting frenzy of mine own From my remembrance clearly banish'd his. How does he, sirrah? Open't, and read it. How now! Art thou mad? Prithee read i' thy right wits. [To FABIAN] Read it you, sirrah. Did he write this? See him deliver'd, Fabian; bring him hither.  Exit FABIAN My lord, so please you, these things further thought on, To think me as well a sister as a wife, One day shall crown th' alliance on't, so please you, Here at my house, and at my proper cost. A sister! You are she.  Re-enter FABIAN, with MALVOLIO Ay, my lord, this same. How now, Malvolio! Have I, Malvolio? No. Alas, Malvolio, this is not my writing, Though, I confess, much like the character; But out of question 'tis Maria's hand. And now I do bethink me, it was she First told me thou wast mad; then cam'st in smiling, And in such forms which here were presuppos'd Upon thee in the letter. Prithee, be content; This practice hath most shrewdly pass'd upon thee, But, when we know the grounds and authors of it, Thou shalt be both the plaintiff and the judge Of thine own cause. Alas, poor fool, how have they baffl'd thee! He hath been most notoriously abus'd.
