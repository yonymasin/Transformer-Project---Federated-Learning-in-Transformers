That you are like to Sir Vincentio. His name and credit shall you undertake, And in my house you shall be friendly lodg'd; Look that you take upon you as you should. You understand me, sir. So shall you stay Till you have done your business in the city. If this be court'sy, sir, accept of it. Then go with me to make the matter good. This, by the way, I let you understand: My father is here look'd for every day To pass assurance of a dow'r in marriage 'Twixt me and one Baptista's daughter here. In all these circumstances I'll instruct you. Go with me to clothe you as becomes you. Exeunt Sir, this is the house; please it you that I call? 'Tis well; and hold your own, in any case, With such austerity as longeth to a father.  Enter BIONDELLO Fear you not him. Sirrah Biondello, Now do your duty throughly, I advise you. Imagine 'twere the right Vincentio. But hast thou done thy errand to Baptista? Th'art a tall fellow; hold thee that to drink. Here comes Baptista. Set your countenance, sir.  Enter BAPTISTA, and LUCENTIO as CAMBIO Signior Baptista, you are happily met. [To To the PEDANT] Sir, this is the gentleman I told you of; I pray you stand good father to me now; Give me Bianca for my patrimony. I thank you, sir. Where then do you know best We be affied, and such assurance ta'en As shall with either part's agreement stand? Then at my lodging, an it like you. There doth my father lie; and there this night We'll pass the business privately and well. Send for your daughter by your servant here; My boy shall fetch the scrivener presently. The worst is this, that at so slender warning You are like to have a thin and slender pittance. Dally not with the gods, but get thee gone.  Exit BIONDELLO Signior Baptista, shall I lead the way? Welcome! One mess is like to be your cheer; Come, sir; we will better it in Pisa. Sir, what are you that offer to beat my servant? How now! what's the matter? Sir, you seem a sober ancient gentleman by your habit, but your words show you a madman. Why, sir, what 'cerns it you if I wear pearl and gold? I thank my good father, I am able to maintain it. Call forth an officer.  Enter one with an OFFICER Carry this mad knave to the gaol. Father Baptista, I charge you see that he be forthcoming. Then thou wert best say that I am not Lucentio. O, sir, Lucentio slipp'd me like his greyhound, Which runs himself, and catches for his master. 'Tis well, sir, that you hunted for yourself; 'Tis thought your deer does hold you at a bay.
