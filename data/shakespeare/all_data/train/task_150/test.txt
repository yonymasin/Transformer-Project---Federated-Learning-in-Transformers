But I will tell you at some meeter season. The business of this man looks out of him; We'll hear him what he says. Whence are you? Bid her have good heart. She soon shall know of us, by some of ours, How honourable and how kindly we Determine for her; for Caesar cannot learn To be ungentle. Come hither, Proculeius. Go and say We purpose her no shame. Give her what comforts The quality of her passion shall require, Lest, in her greatness, by some mortal stroke She do defeat us; for her life in Rome Would be eternal in our triumph. Go, And with your speediest bring us what she says, And how you find her. Gallus, go you along. Exit GALLUS Where's Dolabella, to second Proculeius? Let him alone, for I remember now How he's employ'd; he shall in time be ready. Go with me to my tent, where you shall see How hardly I was drawn into this war, How calm and gentle I proceeded still In all my writings. Go with me, and see What I can show in this. Exeunt  SCENE II.  Alexandria. The monument  Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and MARDIAN Which is the Queen of Egypt? Arise, you shall not kneel. I pray you, rise; rise, Egypt. Take to you no hard thoughts. The record of what injuries you did us, Though written in our flesh, we shall remember As things but done by chance. Cleopatra, know We will extenuate rather than enforce. If you apply yourself to our intents- Which towards you are most gentle- you shall find A benefit in this change; but if you seek To lay on me a cruelty by taking Antony's course, you shall bereave yourself Of my good purposes, and put your children To that destruction which I'll guard them from, If thereon you rely. I'll take my leave. You shall advise me in all for Cleopatra. Nay, blush not, Cleopatra; I approve Your wisdom in the deed. Good Queen, let us entreat you. Forbear, Seleucus. Exit SELEUCUS Cleopatra, Not what you have reserv'd, nor what acknowledg'd, Put we i' th' roll of conquest. Still be't yours, Bestow it at your pleasure; and believe Caesar's no merchant, to make prize with you Of things that merchants sold. Therefore be cheer'd; Make not your thoughts your prisons. No, dear Queen; For we intend so to dispose you as Yourself shall give us counsel. Feed and sleep. Our care and pity is so much upon you That we remain your friend; and so, adieu. Not so. Adieu.  Flourish. Exeunt CAESAR and his train Bravest at the last, She levell'd at our purposes, and being royal, Took her own way. The manner of their deaths? I do not see them bleed. Poison'd then. O noble weakness! If they had swallow'd poison 'twould appear By external swelling; but she looks like sleep, As she would catch another Antony In her strong toil of grace. Most probable That so she died; for her physician tells me She hath pursu'd conclusions infinite Of easy ways to die. Take up her bed, And bear her women from the monument. She shall be buried by her Antony; No grave upon the earth shall clip in it A pair so famous. High events as these Strike those that make them; and their story is No less in pity than his glory which Brought them to be lamented. Our army shall In solemn show attend this funeral, And then to Rome. Come, Dolabella, see High order in this great solemnity. Exeunt
