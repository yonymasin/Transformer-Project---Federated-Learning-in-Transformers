to mend your shoes. Come, wherefore should you be so pashful? Your shoes is not so good. 'Tis a good silling, I warrant you, or I will change it.  Enter an ENGLISH HERALD Is it not lawful, an please your Majesty, to tell how many is kill'd? Yes, my conscience, he did us great good. There is occasions and causes why and wherefore in all things. I will tell you, ass my friend, Captain Gower: the rascally, scald, beggarly, lousy, pragging knave, Pistol- which you and yourself and all the world know to be no petter than a fellow, look you now, of no merits- he is come to me, and prings me pread and salt yesterday, look you, and bid me eat my leek; it was in a place where I could not breed no contendon with him; but I will be so bold as to wear it in my cap till I see him once again, and then I will tell him a little piece of my desires.  Enter PISTOL 'Tis no matter for his swellings nor his turkey-cocks. God pless you, Aunchient Pistol! you scurvy, lousy knave, God pless you! I peseech you heartily, scurvy, lousy knave, at my desires, and my requests, and my petitions, to eat, look you, this leek; because, look you, you do not love it, nor your affections, and your appetites, and your digestions, does not agree with it, I would desire you to eat it. There is one goat for you. [Strikes him] Will you be so good, scald knave, as eat it? You say very true, scald knave- when God's will is. I will desire you to live in the meantime, and eat your victuals; come, there is sauce for it. [Striking him again] You call'd me yesterday mountain-squire; but I will make you to-day a squire of low degree. I pray you fall to; if you can mock a leek, you can eat a leek. I say I will make him eat some part of my leek, or I will peat his pate four days. Bite, I pray you, it is good for your green wound and your ploody coxcomb. Yes, certainly, and out of doubt, and out of question too, and ambiguides. Eat, I pray you; will you have some more sauce to your leek? There is not enough leek to swear by. Much good do you, scald knave, heartily. Nay, pray you throw none away; the skin is good for your broken coxcomb. When you take occasions to see leeks hereafter, I pray you mock at 'em; that is all. Ay, leeks is good. Hold you, there is a groat to heal your pate. Yes, verily and in truth, you shall take it; or I have another leek in my pocket which you shall eat. If I owe you anything I will pay you in cudgels; you shall be a woodmonger, and buy nothing of me but cudgels. God bye you, and keep you, and heal your pate.
