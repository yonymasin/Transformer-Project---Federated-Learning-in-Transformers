Call you this railing? Call you this chiding? It is to be all made of sighs and tears; And so am I for Phebe. It is to be all made of faith and service; And so am I for Phebe. It is to be all made of fantasy, All made of passion, and all made of wishes; All adoration, duty, and observance, All humbleness, all patience, and impatience, All purity, all trial, all obedience; And so am I for Phebe. If this be so, why blame you me to love you? I'll not fail, if I live. Though to have her and death were both one thing.
