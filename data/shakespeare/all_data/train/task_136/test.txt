I understand thy kisses, and thou mine, And that's a feeling disputation. But I will never be a truant, love, Till I have learnt thy language: for thy tongue Makes Welsh as sweet as ditties highly penn'd, Sung by a fair queen in a summer's bow'r, With ravishing division, to her lute. O, I am ignorance itself in this! With all my heart I'll sit and hear her sing. By that time will our book, I think, be drawn. With all my heart.  Exeunt.
