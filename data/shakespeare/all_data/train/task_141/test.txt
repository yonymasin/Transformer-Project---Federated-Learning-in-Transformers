What sayest thou? I hope so. Pray thee, marry us. I will. Why, now; as fast as she can marry us. I take thee, Rosalind, for wife. So do all thoughts; they are wing'd. For ever and a day. But will my Rosalind do so? O, but she is wise. A man that had a wife with such a wit, he might say 'Wit, whither wilt?' ROSALIND. Nay, you might keep that check for it, till you met your wife's wit going to your neighbour's bed. And what wit could wit have to excuse that? For these two hours, Rosalind, I will leave thee. I must attend the Duke at dinner; by two o'clock I will be with thee again. Ay, sweet Rosalind. With no less religion than if thou wert indeed my Rosalind; so, adieu. Is't possible that on so little acquaintance you should like her? that but seeing you should love her? and loving woo? and, wooing, she should grant? and will you persever to enjoy her? You have my consent. Let your wedding be to-morrow. Thither will I invite the Duke and all's contented followers. Go you and prepare Aliena; for, look you, here comes my Rosalind.  Enter ROSALIND It is my arm. Wounded it is, but with the eyes of a lady. Ay, and greater wonders than that. They shall be married to-morrow; and I will bid the Duke to the nuptial. But, O, how bitter a thing it is to look into happiness through another man's eyes! By so much the more shall I to-morrow be at the height of heart-heaviness, by how much I shall think my brother happy in having what he wishes for. I can live no longer by thinking. Speak'st thou in sober meanings? And I for Rosalind. And I for Rosalind. And so am I for Rosalind. If this be so, why blame you me to love you? To her that is not here, nor doth not hear. Nor I. Exeunt I sometimes do believe and sometimes do not: As those that fear they hope, and know they fear.  Enter ROSALIND, SILVIUS, and PHEBE That would I, were I of all kingdoms king. My lord, the first time that I ever saw him Methought he was a brother to your daughter. But, my good lord, this boy is forest-born, And hath been tutor'd in the rudiments Of many desperate studies by his uncle, Whom he reports to be a great magician, Obscured in the circle of this forest.  Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY If there be truth in sight, you are my Rosalind.
