That's seal'd in approbation? You, Lord Escalus, Sit with my cousin; lend him your kind pains To find out this abuse, whence 'tis deriv'd. There is another friar that set them on; Let him be sent for. Go, do it instantly. Exit PROVOST And you, my noble and well-warranted cousin, Whom it concerns to hear this matter forth, Do with your injuries as seems you best In any chastisement. I for a while will leave you; But stir not you till you have well determin'd Upon these slanderers. 'Tis false. Respect to your great place! and let the devil Be sometime honour'd for his burning throne! Where is the Duke? 'Tis he should hear me speak. Boldly, at least. But, O, poor souls, Come you to seek the lamb here of the fox, Good night to your redress! Is the Duke gone? Then is your cause gone too. The Duke's unjust Thus to retort your manifest appeal, And put your trial in the villain's mouth Which here you come to accuse. Be not so hot; the Duke Dare no more stretch this finger of mine than he Dare rack his own; his subject am I not, Nor here provincial. My business in this state Made me a looker-on here in Vienna, Where I have seen corruption boil and bubble Till it o'errun the stew: laws for all faults, But faults so countenanc'd that the strong statutes Stand like the forfeits in a barber's shop, As much in mock as mark. I remember you, sir, by the sound of your voice. I met you at the prison, in the absence of the Duke. Most notedly, sir. You must, sir, change persons with me ere you make that my report; you, indeed, spoke so of him; and much more, much worse. I protest I love the Duke as I love myself. Stay, sir; stay awhile. Thou art the first knave that e'er mad'st a duke. First, Provost, let me bail these gentle three. [To Lucio] Sneak not away, sir, for the friar and you Must have a word anon. Lay hold on him. [To ESCALUS] What you have spoke I pardon; sit you down. We'll borrow place of him. [To ANGELO] Sir, by your leave. Hast thou or word, or wit, or impudence, That yet can do thee office? If thou hast, Rely upon it till my tale be heard, And hold no longer out. Come hither, Mariana. Say, wast thou e'er contracted to this woman? Go, take her hence and marry her instantly. Do you the office, friar; which consummate, Return him here again. Go with him, Provost.  Exeunt ANGELO, MARIANA, FRIAR PETER, and PROVOST Come hither, Isabel. Your friar is now your prince. As I was then Advertising and holy to your business, Not changing heart with habit, I am still Attorney'd at your service. You are pardon'd, Isabel. And now, dear maid, be you as free to us. Your brother's death, I know, sits at your heart; And you may marvel why I obscur'd myself, Labouring to save his life, and would not rather Make rash remonstrance of my hidden pow'r Than let him so be lost. O most kind maid, It was the swift celerity of his death, Which I did think with slower foot came on, That brain'd my purpose. But peace be with him! That life is better life, past fearing death, Than that which lives to fear. Make it your comfort, So happy is your brother. For this new-married man approaching here, Whose salt imagination yet hath wrong'd Your well-defended honour, you must pardon For Mariana's sake; but as he adjudg'd your brother- Being criminal in double violation Of sacred chastity and of promise-breach, Thereon dependent, for your brother's life- The very mercy of the law cries out Most audible, even from his proper tongue, 'An Angelo for Claudio, death for death!' Haste still pays haste, and leisure answers leisure; Like doth quit like, and Measure still for Measure. Then, Angelo, thy fault's thus manifested, Which, though thou wouldst deny, denies thee vantage. We do condemn thee to the very block Where Claudio stoop'd to death, and with like haste. Away with him! It is your husband mock'd you with a husband. Consenting to the safeguard of your honour, I thought your marriage fit; else imputation, For that he knew you, might reproach your life, And choke your good to come. For his possessions, Although by confiscation they are ours, We do instate and widow you withal To buy you a better husband. Never crave him; we are definitive. You do but lose your labour. Away with him to death! [To LUCIO] Now, sir, to you. Against all sense you do importune her. Should she kneel down in mercy of this fact, Her brother's ghost his paved bed would break, And take her hence in horror. He dies for Claudio's death. Your suit's unprofitable; stand up, I say. I have bethought me of another fault. Provost, how came it Claudio was beheaded At an unusual hour? Had you a special warrant for the deed? For which I do discharge you of your office; Give up your keys. What's he? I would thou hadst done so by Claudio. Go fetch him hither; let me look upon him. Exit PROVOST Which is that Barnardine? There was a friar told me of this man. Sirrah, thou art said to have a stubborn soul, That apprehends no further than this world, And squar'st thy life according. Thou'rt condemn'd; But, for those earthly faults, I quit them all, And pray thee take this mercy to provide For better times to come. Friar, advise him; I leave him to your hand. What muffl'd fellow's that? [To ISABELLA] If he be like your brother, for his sake Is he pardon'd; and for your lovely sake, Give me your hand and say you will be mine, He is my brother too. But fitter time for that. By this Lord Angelo perceives he's safe; Methinks I see a quick'ning in his eye. Well, Angelo, your evil quits you well. Look that you love your wife; her worth worth yours. I find an apt remission in myself; And yet here's one in place I cannot pardon. To Lucio] You, sirrah, that knew me for a fool, a coward, One all of luxury, an ass, a madman! Wherein have I so deserv'd of you That you extol me thus? Whipt first, sir, and hang'd after. Proclaim it, Provost, round about the city, If any woman wrong'd by this lewd fellow- As I have heard him swear himself there's one Whom he begot with child, let her appear, And he shall marry her. The nuptial finish'd, Let him be whipt and hang'd. Upon mine honour, thou shalt marry her. Thy slanders I forgive; and therewithal Remit thy other forfeits. Take him to prison; And see our pleasure herein executed. Slandering a prince deserves it.  Exeunt OFFICERS with LUCIO She, Claudio, that you wrong'd, look you restore. Joy to you, Mariana! Love her, Angelo; I have confess'd her, and I know her virtue. Thanks, good friend Escalus, for thy much goodness; There's more behind that is more gratulate. Thanks, Provost, for thy care and secrecy; We shall employ thee in a worthier place. Forgive him, Angelo, that brought you home The head of Ragozine for Claudio's: Th' offence pardons itself. Dear Isabel, I have a motion much imports your good; Whereto if you'll a willing ear incline, What's mine is yours, and what is yours is mine. So, bring us to our palace, where we'll show What's yet behind that's meet you all should know.  Exeunt
