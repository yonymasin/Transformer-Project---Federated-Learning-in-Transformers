 [Exeunt.] I do. None, my lord. And seem'd I ever otherwise to you? Is my lord well that he doth speak so wide? 'True!' O God! O, God defend me! How am I beset! What kind of catechising call you this? Is it not Hero? Who can blot that name With any just reproach? I talk'd with no man at that hour, my lord. They know that do accuse me; I know none. If I know more of any man alive Than that which maiden modesty doth warrant, Let all my sins lack mercy! O my father, Prove you that any man with me convers'd At hours unmeet, or that I yesternight Maintain'd the change of words with any creature, Refuse me, hate me, torture me to death! And when I liv'd I was your other wife; [Unmasks.] And when you lov'd you were my other husband. Nothing certainer. One Hero died defil'd; but I do live, And surely as I live, I am a maid. And here's another, Writ in my cousin's hand, stol'n from her pocket, Containing her affection unto Benedick.
