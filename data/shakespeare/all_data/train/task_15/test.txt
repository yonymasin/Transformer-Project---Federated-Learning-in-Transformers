 [Looking on the QUEEN] Heaven  bless thee! Thou hast the sweetest face I ever look'd on. Sir, as I have a soul, she is an angel; Our king has all the Indies in his arms, And more and richer, when he strains that lady; I cannot blame his conscience. Those men are happy; and so are all  are near her. I take it she that carries up the train Is that old noble lady, Duchess of Norfolk. Their coronets say so. These are stars indeed, And sometimes falling ones. You saw The ceremony? Good sir, speak it to us. But what follow'd? What two reverend bishops Were those that went on each side of the Queen? He of Winchester Is held no great good lover of the Archbishop's, The virtuous Cranmer. Who may that be, I pray you? He will deserve more.
