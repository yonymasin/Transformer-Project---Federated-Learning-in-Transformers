From thence the sauce to meat is ceremony; Meeting were bare without it. Sit, worthy friends; my lord is often thus, And hath been from his youth. Pray you, keep seat. The fit is momentary; upon a thought He will again be well. If much you note him, You shall offend him and extend his passion. Feed, and regard him not-Are you a man? O proper stuff! This is the very painting of your fear; This is the air-drawn dagger which you said Led you to Duncan. O, these flaws and starts, Impostors to true fear, would well become A woman's story at a winter's fire, Authorized by her grandam. Shame itself! Why do you make such faces? When all's done, You look but on a stool. What, quite unmann'd in folly? Fie, for shame! My worthy lord, Your noble friends do lack you. Think of this, good peers, But as a thing of custom. 'Tis no other, Only it spoils the pleasure of the time. You have displaced the mirth, broke the good meeting, With most admired disorder. I pray you, speak not; he grows worse and worse; Question enrages him. At once, good night. Stand not upon the order of your going, But go at once. A kind good night to all!  Exeunt all but Macbeth and Lady Macbeth. Almost at odds with morning, which is which. Did you send to him, sir? You lack the season of all natures, sleep. Yet here's a spot. Out, damned spot! Out, I say! One- two -why then 'tis time to do't. Hell is murky. Fie, my lord, fie! A soldier, and afeard? What need we fear who knows it, when none can call our power to account? Yet who would have thought the old man to have had so much blood in him? The Thane of Fife had a wife; where is she now? What, will these hands neer be clean? No more o' that, my lord, no more o' that. You mar all with this starting. Here's the smell of the blood still. All the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand. Oh, oh, oh! Wash your hands, put on your nightgown, look not so pale. I tell you yet again, Banquo's buried; he cannot come out on's grave. To bed, to bed; there's knocking at the gate. Come, come, come, come, give me your hand.What's done cannot be undone. To bed, to bed, to bed.
