 As if I were their well-acquainted friend;  And every one doth call me by my name.  Some tender money to me, some invite me,  Some other give me thanks for kindnesses,  Some offer me commodities to buy;  Even now a tailor call'd me in his shop,  And show'd me silks that he had bought for me,  And therewithal took measure of my body.  Sure, these are but imaginary wiles,  And Lapland sorcerers inhabit here.  Enter DROMIO OF SYRACUSE  What gold is this? What Adam dost thou mean? I understand thee not. What, thou mean'st an officer? Well, sir, there rest in your foolery. Is  there any ship puts forth to-night? May we be gone? The fellow is distract, and so am I;  And here we wander in illusions.  Some blessed power deliver us from hence!  Enter a COURTEZAN  Satan, avoid! I charge thee, tempt me not. It is the devil. Why, Dromio? Avoid then, fiend! What tell'st thou me of supping?  Thou art, as you are all, a sorceress;  I conjure thee to leave me and be gone. Avaunt, thou witch! Come, Dromio, let us go. I see these witches are afraid of swords. Come to the Centaur; fetch our stuff from thence.  I long that we were safe and sound aboard. I will not stay to-night for all the town;  Therefore away, to get our stuff aboard. I think I had; I never did deny it. Who heard me to deny it or forswear it? Thou art a villain to impeach me thus;  I'll prove mine honour and mine honesty  Against thee presently, if thou dar'st stand. Aegeon, art thou not? or else his No, sir, not I; I came from Syracuse. I, gentle mistress. And so do I, yet did she call me so;  And this fair gentlewoman, her sister here,  Did call me brother. [To LUCIANA] What I told you then,  I hope I shall have leisure to make good;  If this be not a dream I see and hear. I think it be, sir; I deny it not. This purse of ducats I receiv'd from you,  And Dromio my man did bring them me.  I see we still did meet each other's man,  And I was ta'en for him, and he for me,  And thereupon these ERRORS are arose. He speaks to me. I am your master, Dromio.  Come, go with us; we'll look to that anon.  Embrace thy brother there; rejoice with him.
