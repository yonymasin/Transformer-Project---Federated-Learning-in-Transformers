Lord Longaville said I came o'er his heart; And trow you what he call'd me? Yes, in good faith. And Longaville was for my service born. A beard, fair health, and honesty; With threefold love I wish you all these three. No so, my lord; a twelvemonth and a day I'll mark no words that smooth-fac'd wooers say. Come when the King doth to my lady come; Then, if I have much love, I'll give you some. Yet swear not, lest ye be forsworn again.
