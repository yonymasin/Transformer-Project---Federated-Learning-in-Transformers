Here, youth, there is my purse; I give thee this For thy sweet mistress' sake, because thou lov'st her. Farewell. Exit SILVIA with ATTENDANTS Amen, amen! Go on, good Eglamour, Out at the postern by the abbey wall; I fear I am attended by some spies. A thousand more mischances than this one Have learn'd me how to brook this patiently. O Valentine, this I endure for thee! Exeunt O miserable, unhappy that I am! By thy approach thou mak'st me most unhappy. Had I been seized by a hungry lion, I would have been a breakfast to the beast Rather than have false Proteus rescue me. O, heaven be judge how I love Valentine, Whose life's as tender to me as my soul! And full as much, for more there cannot be, I do detest false, perjur'd Proteus. Therefore be gone; solicit me no more. When Proteus cannot love where he's belov'd! Read over Julia's heart, thy first best love, For whose dear sake thou didst then rend thy faith Into a thousand oaths; and all those oaths Descended into perjury, to love me. Thou hast no faith left now, unless thou'dst two, And that's far worse than none; better have none Than plural faith, which is too much by one. Thou counterfeit to thy true friend! All men but Proteus. O heaven!
