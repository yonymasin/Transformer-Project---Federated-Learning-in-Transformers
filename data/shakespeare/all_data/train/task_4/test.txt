Who's there? Speak, ho! speak quickly, or I shoot. Of the part of England. What's that to thee? Why may I not demand Of thine affairs as well as thou of mine? Thou hast a perfect thought. I will upon all hazards well believe Thou art my friend that know'st my tongue so well. Who art thou? Unkind remembrance! thou and eyeless night Have done me shame. Brave soldier, pardon me That any accent breaking from thy tongue Should scape the true acquaintance of mine ear. Why, here walk I in the black brow of night To find you out. O, my sweet sir, news fitting to the night, Black, fearful, comfortless, and horrible. The King, I fear, is poison'd by a monk; I left him almost speechless and broke out To acquaint you with this evil, that you might The better arm you to the sudden time Than if you had at leisure known of this. A monk, I tell you; a resolved villain, Whose bowels suddenly burst out. The King Yet speaks, and peradventure may recover. Why, know you not? The lords are all come back, And brought Prince Henry in their company; At whose request the King hath pardon'd them, And they are all about his Majesty.
