I wonder if the lion be to speak. Would you desire lime and hair to speak better? Pyramus draws near the wall; silence. The wall, methinks, being sensible, should curse again. Now is the moon used between the two neighbours. The best in this kind are but shadows; and the worst are no worse, if imagination amend them. If we imagine no worse of them than they of themselves, they may pass for excellent men. Here come two noble beasts in, a man and a lion.  Enter LION and MOONSHINE A very gentle beast, and of a good conscience. True; and a goose for his discretion. His discretion, I am sure, cannot carry his valour; for the goose carries not the fox. It is well. Leave it to his discretion, and let us listen to the Moon. He is no crescent, and his horns are invisible within the circumference. This is the greatest error of all the rest; the man should be put into the lantern. How is it else the man i' th' moon? It appears, by his small light of discretion, that he is in the wane; but yet, in courtesy, in all reason, we must stay the time. Well run, Thisby. Well mous'd, Lion.  Re-enter PYRAMUS This passion, and the death of a dear friend, would go near to make a man look sad. With the help of a surgeon he might yet recover and yet prove an ass. She will find him by starlight. Here she comes; and her passion ends the play. Moonshine and Lion are left to bury the dead. No epilogue, I pray you; for your play needs no excuse. Never excuse; for when the players are all dead there need none to be blamed. Marry, if he that writ it had played Pyramus, and hang'd himself in Thisby's garter, it would have been a fine tragedy. And so it is, truly; and very notably discharg'd. But come, your Bergomask; let your epilogue alone. [A dance] The iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve. Lovers, to bed; 'tis almost fairy time. I fear we shall out-sleep the coming morn, As much as we this night have overwatch'd. This palpable-gross play hath well beguil'd The heavy gait of night. Sweet friends, to bed. A fortnight hold we this solemnity, In nightly revels and new jollity. Exeunt  Enter PUCK with a broom
