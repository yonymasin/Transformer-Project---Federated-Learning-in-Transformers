There shall not at your father's house these seven years Be born another such. I cannot say 'tis pity She lacks instructions, for she seems a mistress To most that teach. My lord, Fear none of this. I think you know my fortunes Do all lie there. It shall be so my care To have you royally appointed as if The scene you play were mine. For instance, sir, That you may know you shall not want- one word.  [They talk aside]  Re-enter AUTOLYCUS Nay, but my letters, by this means being there So soon as you arrive, shall clear that doubt. Shall satisfy your father.  [seeing AUTOLYCUS] Who have we here? We'll make an instrument of this; omit Nothing may give us aid. How now, good fellow! Why shak'st thou so? Fear not, man; here's no harm intended to thee. Why, be so still; here's nobody will steal that from thee. Yet for the outside of thy poverty we must make an exchange; therefore discase thee instantly- thou must think there's a necessity in't- and change garments with this gentleman. Though the pennyworth on his side be the worst, yet hold thee, there's some boot. [Giving money] Nay, prithee dispatch. The gentleman is half flay'd already. Unbuckle, unbuckle.  FLORIZEL and AUTOLYCUS exchange garments Fortunate mistress- let my prophecy Come home to ye!- you must retire yourself Into some covert; take your sweetheart's hat And pluck it o'er your brows, muffle your face, Dismantle you, and, as you can, disliken The truth of your own seeming, that you may- For I do fear eyes over- to shipboard Get undescried. No remedy. Have you done there? Nay, you shall have no hat.  [Giving it to PERDITA] Come, lady, come. Farewell, my friend.  [Aside] What I do next shall be to tell the King Of this escape, and whither they are bound; Wherein my hope is I shall so prevail To force him after; in whose company I shall re-view Sicilia, for whose sight I have a woman's longing. The swifter speed the better.  Exeunt FLORIZEL, PERDITA, and CAMILLO My lord, your sorrow was too sore laid on, Which sixteen winters cannot blow away, So many summers dry. Scarce any joy Did ever so long live; no sorrow But kill'd itself much sooner. She hangs about his neck. If she pertain to life, let her speak too.
