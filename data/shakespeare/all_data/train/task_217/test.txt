My honour'd lord! Exit LORD CHAMBERLAIN This is strange to me. Come, you are pleasant. Good lady, Make yourself mirth with your particular fancy, And leave me out on't. Would I had no being, If this salute my blood a jot; it faints me To think what follows. The Queen is comfortless, and we forgetful In our long absence. Pray, do not deliver What here y' have heard to her.
