Never's my day, and then a kiss of you. Fie, fie upon her! There's language in her eye, her cheek, her lip, Nay, her foot speaks; her wanton spirits look out At every joint and motive of her body. O these encounters so glib of tongue That give a coasting welcome ere it comes, And wide unclasp the tables of their thoughts To every ticklish reader! Set them down For sluttish spoils of opportunity, And daughters of the game. [Trumpet within] They are oppos'd already. The youngest son of Priam, a true knight; Not yet mature, yet matchless; firm of word; Speaking in deeds and deedless in his tongue; Not soon provok'd, nor being provok'd soon calm'd; His heart and hand both open and both free; For what he has he gives, what thinks he shows, Yet gives he not till judgment guide his bounty, Nor dignifies an impair thought with breath; Manly as Hector, but more dangerous; For Hector in his blaze of wrath subscribes To tender objects, but he in heat of action Is more vindicative than jealous love. They call him Troilus, and on him erect A second hope as fairly built as Hector. Thus says Aeneas, one that knows the youth Even to his inches, and, with private soul, Did in great Ilion thus translate him to me.  [Alarum. HECTOR and AJAX fight] I wonder now how yonder city stands, When we have here her base and pillar by us. Sir, I foretold you then what would ensue. My prophecy is but half his journey yet; For yonder walls, that pertly front your town, Yond towers, whose wanton tops do buss the clouds, Must kiss their own feet. So to him we leave it. Most gentle and most valiant Hector, welcome. After the General, I beseech you next To feast with me and see me at my tent. At Menelaus' tent, most princely Troilus. There Diomed doth feast with him to-night, Who neither looks upon the heaven nor earth, But gives all gaze and bent of amorous view On the fair Cressid. You shall command me, sir. As gentle tell me of what honour was This Cressida in Troy? Had she no lover there That wails her absence? Here comes himself to guide you. [Aside to TROILUS] Follow his torch; he goes to Calchas' tent; I'll keep you company. Stand where the torch may not discover us.  Enter CRESSIDA She will sing any man at first sight. List! How now, Troyan! You are moved, Prince; let us depart, I pray, Lest your displeasure should enlarge itself To wrathful terms. This place is dangerous; The time right deadly; I beseech you, go. Nay, good my lord, go off; You flow to great distraction; come, my lord. You have not patience; come. How now, my lord? You shake, my lord, at something; will you go? You will break out. Come, come. You have sworn patience. My lord! All's done, my lord. Why stay we, then? I cannot conjure, Troyan. Most sure she was. Nor mine, my lord. Cressid was here but now. What hath she done, Prince, that can soil our mothers? May worthy Troilus be half-attach'd With that which here his passion doth express? O, contain yourself; Your passion draws ears hither.  Enter AENEAS I'll bring you to the gates. O, courage, courage, courage, Princes! Great Achilles Is arming, weeping, cursing, vowing vengeance. Patroclus' wounds have rous'd his drowsy blood, Together with his mangled Myrmidons, That noseless, handless, hack'd and chipp'd, come to him, Crying on Hector. Ajax hath lost a friend And foams at mouth, and he is arm'd and at it, Roaring for Troilus; who hath done to-day Mad and fantastic execution, Engaging and redeeming of himself With such a careless force and forceless care As if that luck, in very spite of cunning, Bade him win all.
