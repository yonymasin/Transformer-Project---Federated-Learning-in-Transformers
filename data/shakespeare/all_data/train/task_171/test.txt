or strip your sword stark naked; for meddle you must, that's certain, or forswear to wear iron about you. I Will do so. Signior Fabian, stay you by this gentleman till my return. Exit SIR TOBY Why, man, he's a very devil; I have not seen such a firago. I had a pass with him, rapier, scabbard, and all, and he gives me the stuck in with such a mortal motion that it is inevitable; and on the answer, he pays you as surely as your feet hit the ground they step on. They say he has been fencer to the Sophy. Ay, but he will not now be pacified; Fabian can scarce hold him yonder. I'll make the motion. Stand here, make a good show on't; this shall end without the perdition of souls. [Aside] Marry, I'll ride your horse as well as I ride you.  Re-enter FABIAN and VIOLA [To FABIAN] I have his horse to take up the quarrel; I have persuaded him the youth's a devil. [To VIOLA] There's no remedy, sir: he will fight with you for's oath sake. Marry, he hath better bethought him of his quarrel, and he finds that now scarce to be worth talking of. Therefore draw for the supportance of his vow; he protests he will not hurt you. Come, Sir Andrew, there's no remedy; the gentleman will, for his honour's sake, have one bout with you; he cannot by the duello avoid it; but he has promis'd me, as he is a gentleman and a soldier, he will not hurt you. Come on; to't. You, sir! Why, what are you? Nay, if you be an undertaker, I am for you.  [They draw]  Enter OFFICERS [To ANTONIO] I'll be with you anon. Come hither, knight; come hither, Fabian; we'll whisper o'er a couplet or two of most sage saws. A very dishonest paltry boy, and more a coward than a hare. His dishonesty appears in leaving his friend here in necessity and denying him; and for his cowardship, ask Fabian. Do; cuff him soundly, but never draw thy sword. I dare lay any money 'twill be nothing yet.  Exeunt Hold, sir, or I'll throw your dagger o'er the house.  [Holding SEBASTIAN] Come on, sir; hold. Come, sir, I will not let you go. Come, my young soldier, put up your iron; you are well flesh'd. Come on. What, what? Nay, then I must have an ounce or two of this malapert blood from you. [Draws]  Enter OLIVIA Madam! Jove bless thee, Master Parson. To him, Sir Topas. The knave counterfeits well; a good knave. Well said, Master Parson. My most exquisite Sir Topas! To him in thine own voice, and bring me word how thou find'st him. I would we were well rid of this knavery. If he may be conveniently deliver'd, I would he were; for I am now so far in offence with my niece that I cannot pursue with any safety this sport to the upshot. Come by and by to my chamber.  Exit with MARIA That's all one; has hurt me, and there's th' end on't. Sot, didst see Dick Surgeon, sot? Then he's a rogue and a passy measures pavin. I hate a drunken rogue. Will you help- an ass-head and a coxcomb and a knave, a thin fac'd knave, a gull?
