You may have every day enough of Hector, If you have stomach. The general state, I fear, Can scarce entreat you to be odd with him. No, yonder 'tis; There, where we see the lights. No, not a whit.  Re-enter ACHILLES Troilus! thou coward Troilus! Exit Troilus, thou coward Troilus, show thy head.  Enter DIOMEDES What wouldst thou? Were I the general, thou shouldst have my office Ere that correction. Troilus, I say! What, Troilus!  Enter TROILUS I'll fight with him alone. Stand, Diomed. If it be so, yet bragless let it be; Great Hector was as good a man as he.
