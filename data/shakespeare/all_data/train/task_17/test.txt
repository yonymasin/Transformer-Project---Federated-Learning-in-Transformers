Having bought love with such a bloody spoil. What were I best to say? Her father's  brother Would be her lord? Or shall I say her uncle? Or he that slew her brothers and her uncles? Under what title shall I woo for thee That God, the law, my honour, and her love Can make seem pleasing to her tender years? Which she shall purchase with still-lasting war. That at her hands which the King's King forbids. To wail the title, as her mother doth. But how long shall that title 'ever' last? But how long fairly shall her sweet life last? As long as hell and Richard likes of it. But she, your subject, loathes such sovereignty. An honest tale speeds best being plainly told. Plain and not honest is too harsh a style. O, no, my reasons are too deep and  dead- Too deep and dead, poor infants, in their graves. Harp on it still shall I till heartstrings break. Profan'd, dishonour'd, and the third usurp'd. By nothing; for this is no oath: Thy George, profan'd, hath lost his lordly honour; Thy garter, blemish'd, pawn'd his knightly virtue; Thy crown, usurp'd, disgrac'd his kingly glory. If something thou wouldst swear to be believ'd, Swear then by something that thou hast not wrong'd. Thy self is self-misus'd. 'Tis full of thy foul wrongs. Thy life hath it dishonour'd. God's wrong is most of all. If thou didst fear to break an oath with Him, The unity the King my husband made Thou hadst not broken, nor my brothers died. If thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by Him, Th' imperial metal, circling now thy head, Had grac'd the tender temples of my child; And both the Princes had been breathing here, Which now, two tender bedfellows for dust, Thy broken faith hath made the prey for worms. What canst thou swear by now? That thou hast wronged in the time o'erpast; For I myself have many tears to wash Hereafter time, for time past wrong'd by thee. The children live whose fathers thou hast slaughter'd, Ungovern'd youth, to wail it in their age; The parents live whose children thou hast butcheed, Old barren plants, to wail it with their age. Swear not by time to come; for that thou hast Misus'd ere us'd, by times ill-us'd o'erpast. Shall I be tempted of the devil thus? Shall I forget myself to be myself? Yet thou didst kill my children. Shall I go win my daughter to thy will? I go. Write to me very shortly, And you shall understand from me her mind.
