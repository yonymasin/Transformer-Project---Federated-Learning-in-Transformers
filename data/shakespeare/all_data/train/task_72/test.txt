And with his troops doth march amain to London; And many giddy people flock to him. In Warwickshire I have true-hearted friends, Not mutinous in peace, yet bold in war; Those will I muster up, and thou, son Clarence, Shalt stir up in Suffolk, Norfolk, and in Kent, The knights and gentlemen to come with thee. Thou, brother Montague, in Buckingham, Northampton, and in Leicestershire, shalt find Men well inclin'd to hear what thou command'st. And thou, brave Oxford, wondrous well belov'd, In Oxfordshire shalt muster up thy friends. My sovereign, with the loving citizens, Like to his island girt in with the ocean Or modest Dian circled with her nymphs, Shall rest in London till we come to him. Fair lords, take leave and stand not to reply. Farewell, my sovereign. Farewell, sweet lords; let's meet at Coventry.  Exeunt all but the KING and EXETER Where is the post that came from valiant Oxford? How far hence is thy lord, mine honest fellow? How far off is our brother Montague? Where is the post that came from Montague? Say, Somerville, what says my loving son? And by thy guess how nigh is Clarence now? Then Clarence is at hand; I hear his drum. Who should that be? Belike unlook'd for friends. O unbid spite! Is sportful Edward come? Where slept our scouts or how are they seduc'd That we could hear no news of his repair? Nay, rather, wilt thou draw thy forces hence, Confess who set thee up and pluck'd thee down, Call Warwick patron, and be penitent? And thou shalt still remain the Duke of York. Is not a dukedom, sir, a goodly gift? 'Twas I that gave the kingdom to thy brother. Thou art no Atlas for so great a weight; And, weakling, Warwick takes his gift again; And Henry is my King, Warwick his subject. I had rather chop this hand off at a blow, And with the other fling it at thy face, Than bear so low a sail to strike to thee. O cheerful colours! See where Oxford comes. O, welcome, Oxford! for we want thy help.  Enter MONTAGUE, with drum and colours And lo where George of Clarence sweeps along, Of force enough to bid his brother battle; With whom an upright zeal to right prevails More than the nature of a brother's love. Come, Clarence, come. Thou wilt if Warwick call. O passing traitor, perjur'd and unjust! Alas, I am not coop'd here for defence! I will away towards Barnet presently And bid thee battle, Edward, if thou dar'st. Ah, who is nigh? Come to me, friend or foe, And tell me who is victor, York or Warwick? Why ask I that? My mangled body shows, My blood, my want of strength, my sick heart shows, That I must yield my body to the earth And, by my fall, the conquest to my foe. Thus yields the cedar to the axe's edge, Whose arms gave shelter to the princely eagle, Under whose shade the ramping lion slept, Whose top-branch overpeer'd Jove's spreading tree And kept low shrubs from winter's pow'rful wind. These eyes, that now are dimm'd with death's black veil, Have been as piercing as the mid-day sun To search the secret treasons of the world; The wrinkles in my brows, now fill'd with blood, Were lik'ned oft to kingly sepulchres; For who liv'd King, but I could dig his grave? And who durst smile when Warwick bent his brow? Lo now my glory smear'd in dust and blood! My parks, my walks, my manors, that I had, Even now forsake me; and of all my lands Is nothing left me but my body's length. what is pomp, rule, reign, but earth and dust? And live we how we can, yet die we must.  Enter OXFORD and SOMERSET Why then, I would not fly. Ah, Montague, If thou be there, sweet brother, take my hand, And with thy lips keep in my soul a while! Thou lov'st me not; for, brother, if thou didst, Thy tears would wash this cold congealed blood That glues my lips and will not let me speak. Come quickly, Montague, or I am dead. Sweet rest his soul! Fly, lords, and save yourselves: For Warwick bids you all farewell, to meet in heaven.  [Dies]
