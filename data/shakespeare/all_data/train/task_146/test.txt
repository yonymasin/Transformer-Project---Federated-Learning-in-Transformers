Come hither from the furrow, and be merry; Make holiday; your rye-straw hats put on, And these fresh nymphs encounter every one In country footing.  Enter certain REAPERS, properly habited; they join  with the NYMPHS in a graceful dance; towards the  end whereof PROSPERO starts suddenly, and speaks,  after which, to a strange, hollow, and confused  noise, they heavily vanish
