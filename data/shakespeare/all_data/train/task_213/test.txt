I doubt we should have been too young for them. Dost thou wear thy wit by thy side? As I am an honest man, he looks pale. Art thou sick or angry? By this light, he changes more and more. I think he be angry indeed. What, a feast, a feast? I'll tell thee how Beatrice prais'd thy wit the other day. I said thou hadst a fine wit: 'True,' said she, 'a fine little one.' 'No,' said I, 'a great wit.' 'Right,' says she, 'a great gross one.' 'Nay,' said I, 'a good wit.' 'Just,' said she, 'it hurts nobody.' 'Nay,' said I, 'the gentleman is wise.' 'Certain,' said she, a wise gentleman.' 'Nay,' said I, 'he hath the tongues.' 'That I believe' said she, 'for he swore a thing to me on Monday night which he forswore on Tuesday morning. There's a double tongue; there's two tongues.' Thus did she an hour together transshape thy particular virtues. Yet at last she concluded with a sigh, thou wast the proper'st man in Italy. Yea, that she did; but yet, for all that, an if she did not hate him deadly, she would love him dearly. The old man's daughter told us all. But when shall we set the savage bull's horns on the sensible Benedick's head? He is in earnest. And hath challeng'd thee. What a pretty thing man is when he goes in his doublet and hose and leaves off his wit!  Conrade and Borachio. But, soft you, let me be! Pluck up, my heart, and be sad! Did he not say my brother was fled? How now? two of my brother's men bound? Borachio one. Officers, what offence have these men done? First, I ask thee what they have done; thirdly, I ask thee what's their offence; sixth and lastly, why they are committed; and to conclude, what you lay to their charge. Who have you offended, masters, that you are thus bound to your answer? This learned constable is too cunning to be understood. What's your offence? Runs not this speech like iron through your blood? But did my brother set thee on to this? He is compos'd and fram'd of treachery, And fled he is upon this villany. By my soul, nor I! And yet, to satisfy this good old man, I would bend under any heavy weight That he'll enjoin me to. We will not fall. Good morrow, masters. Put your torches out. The wolves have prey'd, and look, the gentle day, Before the wheels of Phoebus, round about Dapples the drowsy east with spots of grey. Thanks to you all, and leave us. Fare you well. Come, let us hence and put on other weeds, And then to Leonato's we will go. Good morrow to this fair assembly. Good morrow, Benedick. Why, what's the matter That you have such a February face, So full of frost, of storm, and cloudiness? The former Hero! Hero that is dead!
