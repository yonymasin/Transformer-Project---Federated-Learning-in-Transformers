Takes on the point of honour to support So dissolute a crew. And what said the gallant? As dissolute as desperate; yet through both I see some sparks of better hope, which elder years May happily bring forth. But who comes here?  Enter AUMERLE amazed What means our cousin that he stares and looks So wildly? Withdraw yourselves, and leave us here alone.  Exeunt PERCY and LORDS What is the matter with our cousin now? Intended or committed was this fault? If on the first, how heinous e'er it be, To win thy after-love I pardon thee. Have thy desire.  [The DUKE OF YORK knocks at the door and crieth] [Drawing] Villain, I'll make thee safe. What is the matter, uncle? Speak; Recover breath; tell us how near is danger, That we may arm us to encounter it. O heinous, strong, and bold conspiracy! O loyal father of a treacherous son! Thou sheer, immaculate, and silver fountain, From whence this stream through muddy passages Hath held his current and defil'd himself! Thy overflow of good converts to bad; And thy abundant goodness shall excuse This deadly blot in thy digressing son. What shrill-voic'd suppliant makes this eager cry? Our scene is alt'red from a serious thing, And now chang'd to 'The Beggar and the King.' My dangerous cousin, let your mother in. I know she is come to pray for your foul sin. Rise up, good aunt. Good aunt, stand up. Good aunt, stand up. I pardon him, as God shall pardon me. With all my heart I pardon him. But for our trusty brother-in-law and the Abbot, With all the rest of that consorted crew, Destruction straight shall dog them at the heels. Good uncle, help to order several powers To Oxford, or where'er these traitors are. They shall not live within this world, I swear, But I will have them, if I once know where. Uncle, farewell; and, cousin, adieu; Your mother well hath pray'd, and prove you true. Kind uncle York, the latest news we hear Is that the rebels have consum'd with fire Our town of Ciceter in Gloucestershire; But whether they be ta'en or slain we hear not.  Enter NORTHUMBERLAND Welcome, my lord. What is the news? We thank thee, gentle Percy, for thy pains; And to thy worth will add right worthy gains.  Enter FITZWATER Thy pains, Fitzwater, shall not be forgot; Right noble is thy merit, well I wot.  Enter PERCY, With the BISHOP OF CARLISLE Carlisle, this is your doom: Choose out some secret place, some reverend room, More than thou hast, and with it joy thy life; So as thou liv'st in peace, die free from strife; For though mine enemy thou hast ever been, High sparks of honour in thee have I seen.  Enter EXTON, with attendants, hearing a coffin Exton, I thank thee not; for thou hast wrought A deed of slander with thy fatal hand Upon my head and all this famous land. They love not poison that do poison need, Nor do I thee. Though I did wish him dead, I hate the murderer, love him murdered. The guilt of conscience take thou for thy labour, But neither my good word nor princely favour; With Cain go wander thorough shades of night, And never show thy head by day nor light. Lords, I protest my soul is full of woe That blood should sprinkle me to make me grow. Come, mourn with me for what I do lament, And put on sullen black incontinent. I'll make a voyage to the Holy Land, To wash this blood off from my guilty hand. March sadly after; grace my mournings here In weeping after this untimely bier. Exeunt
