be laid upon the children; therefore, I promise you, I fear you. I was always plain with you, and so now I speak my agitation of the matter; therefore be o' good cheer, for truly I think you are damn'd. There is but one hope in it that can do you any good, and that is but a kind of bastard hope, neither. Marry, you may partly hope that your father got you not- Truly then I fear you are damn'd both by father and mother; thus when I shun Scylla, your father, I fall into Charybdis, your mother; well, you are gone both ways. Truly, the more to blame he; we were Christians enow before, e'en as many as could well live one by another. This making of Christians will raise the price of hogs; if we grow all to be pork-eaters, we shall not shortly have a rasher on the coals for money.  Enter LORENZO It is much that the Moor should be more than reason; but if she be less than an honest woman, she is indeed more than I took her for. That is done, sir; they have all stomachs. That is done too, sir, only 'cover' is the word. Not so, sir, neither; I know my duty. For the table, sir, it shall be serv'd in; for the meat, sir, it shall be cover'd; for your coming in to dinner, sir, why, let it be as humours and conceits shall govern. Sola, sola! wo ha, ho! sola, sola! Sola! Did you see Master Lorenzo? Master Lorenzo! Sola, sola! Sola! Where, where? Tell him there's a post come from my master with his horn full of good news; my master will be here ere morning.
