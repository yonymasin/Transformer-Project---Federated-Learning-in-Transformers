In thrilling region of thick-ribbed ice; To be imprison'd in the viewless winds, And blown with restless violence round about The pendent world; or to be worse than worst Of those that lawless and incertain thought Imagine howling- 'tis too horrible. The weariest and most loathed worldly life That age, ache, penury, and imprisonment, Can lay on nature is a paradise To what we fear of death. Sweet sister, let me live. What sin you do to save a brother's life, Nature dispenses with the deed so far That it becomes a virtue. Nay, hear me, Isabel. O, hear me, Isabella.  Re-enter DUKE Let me ask my sister pardon. I am so out of love with life that I will sue to be rid of it. As fast lock'd up in sleep as guiltless labour When it lies starkly in the traveller's bones. He will not wake.
