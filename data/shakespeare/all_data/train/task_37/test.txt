Fie, fie! what, are you mad? You are too hot. Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word. Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee. Exit. Hold, take these keys and fetch more spices, nurse. Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time; But I will watch you from such watching now.  Exeunt Lady and Nurse.
