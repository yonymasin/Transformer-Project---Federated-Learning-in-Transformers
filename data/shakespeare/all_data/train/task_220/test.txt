But I was made a king, at nine months old. Was never subject long'd to be a King As I do long and wish to be a subject.  Enter BUCKINGHAM and old CLIFFORD Why, Buckingham, is the traitor Cade surpris'd? Or is he but retir'd to make him strong?  Enter, below, multitudes, with halters about their necks Then, heaven, set ope thy everlasting gates, To entertain my vows of thanks and praise! Soldiers, this day have you redeem'd your lives, And show'd how well you love your Prince and country. Continue still in this so good a mind, And Henry, though he be infortunate, Assure yourselves, will never be unkind. And so, with thanks and pardon to you all, I do dismiss you to your several countries. Thus stands my state, 'twixt Cade and York distress'd; Like to a ship that, having scap'd a tempest, Is straightway calm'd, and boarded with a pirate; But now is Cade driven back, his men dispers'd, And now is York in arms to second him. I pray thee, Buckingham, go and meet him And ask him what's the reason of these arms. Tell him I'll send Duke Edmund to the Tower- And Somerset, we will commit thee thither Until his army be dismiss'd from him. In any case be not too rough in terms, For he is fierce and cannot brook hard language. Come, wife, let's in, and learn to govern better; For yet may England curse my wretched reign.  Flourish. Exeunt Buckingham, doth York intend no harm to us, That thus he marcheth with thee arm in arm? Then what intends these forces thou dost bring? The head of Cade! Great God, how just art Thou! O, let me view his visage, being dead, That living wrought me such exceeding trouble. Tell me, my friend, art thou the man that slew him? How art thou call'd? And what is thy degree? Iden, kneel down. [He kneels] Rise up a knight. We give thee for reward a thousand marks, And will that thou thenceforth attend on us. See, Buckingham! Somerset comes with th' Queen: Go, bid her hide him quickly from the Duke. Ay, Clifford; a bedlam and ambitious humour Makes him oppose himself against his king. Why, Warwick, hath thy knee forgot to bow? Old Salisbury, shame to thy silver hair, Thou mad misleader of thy brainsick son! What, wilt thou on thy death-bed play the ruffian And seek for sorrow with thy spectacles? O, where is faith? O, where is loyalty? If it be banish'd from the frosty head, Where shall it find a harbour in the earth? Wilt thou go dig a grave to find out war And shame thine honourable age with blood? Why art thou old, and want'st experience? Or wherefore dost abuse it, if thou hast it? For shame! In duty bend thy knee to me, That bows unto the grave with mickle age. Hast thou not sworn allegiance unto me? Canst thou dispense with heaven for such an oath? Call Buckingham, and bid him arm himself. Can we outrun the heavens? Good Margaret, stay.
