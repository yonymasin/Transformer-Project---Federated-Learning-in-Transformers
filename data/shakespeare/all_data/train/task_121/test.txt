Alas! you know I am no vaunter, I; My scars can witness, dumb although they are, That my report is just and full of truth. But, soft! methinks I do digress too much, Citing my worthless praise. O, pardon me! For when no friends are by, men praise themselves. Thanks, gentle Romans! May I govern so To heal Rome's harms and wipe away her woe! But, gentle people, give me aim awhile, For nature puts me to a heavy task. Stand all aloof; but, uncle, draw you near To shed obsequious tears upon this trunk. O, take this warm kiss on thy pale cold lips. [Kisses TITUS] These sorrowful drops upon thy blood-stain'd face, The last true duties of thy noble son! Come hither, boy; come, come, come, and learn of us To melt in showers. Thy grandsire lov'd thee well; Many a time he danc'd thee on his knee, Sung thee asleep, his loving breast thy pillow; Many a story hath he told to thee, And bid thee bear his pretty tales in mind And talk of them when he was dead and gone. Set him breast-deep in earth, and famish him; There let him stand and rave and cry for food. If any one relieves or pities him, For the offence he dies. This is our doom. Some stay to see him fast'ned in the earth. Some loving friends convey the Emperor hence, And give him burial in his father's grave. My father and Lavinia shall forthwith Be closed in our household's monument. As for that ravenous tiger, Tamora, No funeral rite, nor man in mourning weed, No mournful bell shall ring her burial; But throw her forth to beasts and birds to prey. Her life was beastly and devoid of pity, And being dead, let birds on her take pity. Exeunt
