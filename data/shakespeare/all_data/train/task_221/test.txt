Can any face of brass hold longer out? Here stand I, lady- dart thy skill at me, Bruise me with scorn, confound me with a flout, Thrust thy sharp wit quite through my ignorance, Cut me to pieces with thy keen conceit; And I will wish thee never more to dance, Nor never more in Russian habit wait. O, never will I trust to speeches penn'd, Nor to the motion of a school-boy's tongue, Nor never come in vizard to my friend, Nor woo in rhyme, like a blind harper's song. Taffeta phrases, silken terms precise, Three-pil'd hyperboles, spruce affectation, Figures pedantical- these summer-flies Have blown me full of maggot ostentation. I do forswear them; and I here protest, By this white glove- how white the hand, God knows!- Henceforth my wooing mind shall be express'd In russet yeas, and honest kersey noes. And, to begin, wench- so God help me, law!- My love to thee is sound, sans crack or flaw. Yet I have a trick Of the old rage; bear with me, I am sick; I'll leave it by degrees. Soft, let us see- Write 'Lord have mercy on us' on those three; They are infected; in their hearts it lies; They have the plague, and caught it of your eyes. These lords are visited; you are not free, For the Lord's tokens on you do I see. Our states are forfeit; seek not to undo us. Peace; for I will not have to do with you. Speak for yourselves; my wit is at an end. Lo, he is tilting straight! Peace; I have done.  Enter COSTARD Welcome, pure wit! Thou part'st a fair fray. What, are there but three? And three times thrice is nine. Is not nine. By Jove, I always took three threes for nine. How much is it? Art thou one of the Worthies? Go, bid them prepare. We are shame-proof, my lord, and 'tis some policy To have one show worse than the King's and his company. A right description of our sport, my lord.  Enter ARMADO Why ask you? There is five in the first show. The pedant, the braggart, the hedge-priest, the fool, and the boy: Abate throw at novum, and the whole world again Cannot pick out five such, take each one in his vein. You lie, you are not he. Well said, old mocker; I must needs be friends with thee. My hat to a halfpenny, Pompey proves the best Worthy.  Enter SIR NATHANIEL, for ALEXANDER Your nose smells 'no' in this, most tender-smelling knight. Pompey the Great! Take away the conqueror, take away Alisander. A kissing traitor. How art thou prov'd Judas? Well followed: Judas was hanged on an elder. Because thou hast no face. A death's face in a ring. Saint George's half-cheek in a brooch. Ay, and worn in the cap of a tooth-drawer. And now, forward; for we have put thee in countenance. False: we have given thee faces. An thou wert a lion we would do so. For the ass to the Jude; give it him- Jud-as, away. Hide thy head, Achilles; here comes Hector in arms. This cannot be Hector. A lemon. Greater than Great! Great, great, great Pompey! Pompey the Huge! Pompey is moved. More Ates, more Ates! Stir them on! stir them on! Ay, if 'a have no more man's blood in his belly than will sup a flea. What reason have you for 't? WOrthies away; the scene begins to cloud. Honest plain words best pierce the ear of grief; And by these badges understand the King. For your fair sakes have we neglected time, Play'd foul play with our oaths; your beauty, ladies, Hath much deformed us, fashioning our humours Even to the opposed end of our intents; And what in us hath seem'd ridiculous, As love is full of unbefitting strains, All wanton as a child, skipping and vain; Form'd by the eye and therefore, like the eye, Full of strange shapes, of habits, and of forms, Varying in subjects as the eye doth roll To every varied object in his glance; Which parti-coated presence of loose love Put on by us, if in your heavenly eyes Have misbecom'd our oaths and gravities, Those heavenly eyes that look into these faults Suggested us to make. Therefore, ladies, Our love being yours, the error that love makes Is likewise yours. We to ourselves prove false, By being once false for ever to be true To those that make us both- fair ladies, you; And even that falsehood, in itself a sin, Thus purifies itself and turns to grace. And what to me, my love? and what to me? Studies my lady? Mistress, look on me; Behold the window of my heart, mine eye, What humble suit attends thy answer there. Impose some service on me for thy love. To move wild laughter in the throat of death? It cannot be; it is impossible; Mirth cannot move a soul in agony. A twelvemonth? Well, befall what will befall, I'll jest a twelvemonth in an hospital. Our wooing doth not end like an old play: Jack hath not Jill. These ladies' courtesy Might well have made our sport a comedy. That's too long for a play.  Re-enter ARMADO
