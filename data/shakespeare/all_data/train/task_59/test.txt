Therefore be merry, coz; since sudden sorrow Serves to say thus, 'Some good thing comes to-morrow.' The leaders, having charge from you to stand, Will not go off until they hear you speak. Good tidings, my Lord Hastings; for the which I do arrest thee, traitor, of high treason; And you, Lord Archbishop, and you, Lord Mowbray, Of capital treason I attach you both. Is your assembly so? Retreat is made, and execution stay'd. Health to my sovereign, and new happiness Added to that that am to deliver! Prince John, your son, doth kiss your Grace's hand. Mowbray, the Bishop Scroop, Hastings, and all, Are brought to the correction of your law. There is not now a rebel's sword unsheath'd, But Peace puts forth her olive everywhere. The manner how this action hath been borne Here at more leisure may your Highness read, With every course in his particular. My sovereign lord, cheer up yourself, look up.
