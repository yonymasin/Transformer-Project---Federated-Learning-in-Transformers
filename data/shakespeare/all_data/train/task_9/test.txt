Do you think I will? My lord, will you be true? In kissing, do you render or receive? I'll make my match to live, The kiss you take is better than you give; Therefore no kiss. You are an odd man; give even or give none. No, Paris is not; for you know 'tis true That you are odd, and he is even with you. No, I'll be sworn. You may. Why, beg then. I am your debtor; claim it when 'tis due. Now, my sweet guardian! Hark, a word with you. Remember? Yes. Sweet honey Greek, tempt me no more to folly. I'll tell you what- In faith, I cannot. What would you have me do? I prithee, do not hold me to mine oath; Bid me do anything but that, sweet Greek. Diomed! Hark! a word in your ear. Nay, but you part in anger. Guardian! Why, Greek! In faith, I do not. Come hither once again. In faith, I will, lo; never trust me else. I'll fetch you one. Exit Here, Diomed, keep this sleeve. You look upon that sleeve; behold it well. He lov'd me-O false wench!-Give't me again. It is no matter, now I ha't again. I will not meet with you to-morrow night. I prithee, Diomed, visit me no more. What, this? O all you gods! O pretty, pretty pledge! Thy master now lies thinking on his bed Of thee and me, and sighs, and takes my glove, And gives memorial dainty kisses to it, As I kiss thee. Nay, do not snatch it from me; He that takes that doth take my heart withal. You shall not have it, Diomed; faith, you shall not; I'll give you something else. It is no matter. 'Twas one's that lov'd me better than you will. But, now you have it, take it. By all Diana's waiting women yond, And by herself, I will not tell you whose. Well, well, 'tis done, 'tis past; and yet it is not; I will not keep my word. You shall not go. One cannot speak a word But it straight starts you. Ay, come-O Jove! Do come. I shall be plagu'd. Good night. I prithee come. Exit DIOMEDES Troilus, farewell! One eye yet looks on thee; But with my heart the other eye doth see. Ah, poor our sex! this fault in us I find, The error of our eye directs our mind. What error leads must err; O, then conclude, Minds sway'd by eyes are full of turpitude. Exit
