He's coming, madam; but in very strange manner. He is sure possess'd, madam. No, madam, he does nothing but smile. Your ladyship were best to have some guard about you if he come; for sure the man is tainted in's wits. How do you, Malvolio? Why appear you with this ridiculous boldness before my lady? Lo, how hollow the fiend speaks within him! Did not I tell you? Sir Toby, my lady prays you to have a care of him. La you, an you speak ill of the devil, how he takes it at heart! Pray God he be not bewitched. Marry, and it shall be done to-morrow morning, if I live. My lady would not lose him for more than I'll say. O Lord! Get him to say his prayers, good Sir Toby, get him to pray. No, I warrant you, he will not hear of godliness. Nay, pursue him now, lest the device take air and taint. The house will be the quieter. You may have very fit occasion for't; he is now in some commerce with my lady, and will by and by depart. Nay, I prithee, put on this gown and this beard; make him believe thou art Sir Topas the curate; do it quickly. I'll call Sir Toby the whilst. Exit Thou mightst have done this without thy beard and gown: he sees thee not.
