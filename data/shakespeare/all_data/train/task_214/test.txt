Trust me, a mad host. Follow, gentlemen, follow. I must excuse myself, Master Ford. We have linger'd about a match between Anne Page and my cousin Slender, and this day we shall have our answer. Well, fare you well; we shall have the freer wooing at Master Page's. Exeunt SHALLOW and SLENDER Break their talk, Mistress Quickly; my kinsman shall speak for himself. Be not dismay'd. She's coming; to her, coz. O boy, thou hadst a father! Mistress Anne, my cousin loves you. He will maintain you like a gentlewoman. He will make you a hundred and fifty pounds jointure. Marry, I thank you for it; I thank you for that good comfort. She calls you, coz; I'll leave you. Indeed, Master Ford, this is not well, indeed. By my fidelity, this is not well, Master Ford; this wrongs you. That's good too; but what needs either your mum or her budget? The white will decipher her well enough. It hath struck ten o'clock.
