And stick musk-roses in thy sleek smooth head, And kiss thy fair large ears, my gentle joy. What, wilt thou hear some music, my sweet love? Or say, sweet love, what thou desirest to eat. I have a venturous fairy that shall seek The squirrel's hoard, and fetch thee new nuts. Sleep thou, and I will wind thee in my arms. Fairies, be gone, and be all ways away. Exeunt FAIRIES So doth the woodbine the sweet honeysuckle Gently entwist; the female ivy so Enrings the barky fingers of the elm. O, how I love thee! how I dote on thee! [They sleep]  Enter PUCK My Oberon! What visions have I seen! Methought I was enamour'd of an ass. How came these things to pass? O, how mine eyes do loathe his visage now! Music, ho, music, such as charmeth sleep!  Come, my lord; and in our flight,  Tell me how it came this night  That I sleeping here was found  With these mortals on the ground. Exeunt  To the winding of horns, enter THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA,  EGEUS, and train  First, rehearse your song by rote,  To each word a warbling note;  Hand in hand, with fairy grace,  Will we sing, and bless this place.  [OBERON leading, the FAIRIES sing and dance]
