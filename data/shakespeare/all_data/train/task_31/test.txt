Your over-kindness doth wring tears from me. I do embrace your offer; and dispose For henceforth of poor Claudio. To-night I'll mourn with Hero.  [Exeunt Don Pedro and Claudio.] Is this the monument of Leonato? [reads from a scroll]  Epitaph.  Done to death by slanderous tongues  Was the Hero that here lies.  Death, in guerdon of her wrongs,  Gives her fame which never dies.  So the life that died with shame  Lives in death with glorious fame. Hang thou there upon the tomb,  [Hangs up the scroll.] Praising her when I am dumb. Now, music, sound, and sing your solemn hymn.  Song.  Pardon, goddess of the night,  Those that slew thy virgin knight;  For the which, with songs of woe,  Round about her tomb they go.  Midnight, assist our moan,  Help us to sigh and groan  Heavily, heavily,  Graves, yawn and yield your dead,  Till death be uttered  Heavily, heavily. Now unto thy bones good night! Yearly will I do this rite. Good morrow, masters. Each his several way. And Hymen now with luckier issue speeds Than this for whom we rend'red up this woe. Exeunt. I'll hold my mind, were she an Ethiope. I think he thinks upon the savage bull. Tush, fear not, man! We'll tip thy horns with gold, And all Europa shall rejoice at thee, As once Europa did at lusty Jove When he would play the noble beast in love. For this I owe you. Here comes other reckonings. Which is the lady I must seize upon? Why then, she's mine. Sweet, let me see your face. Give me your hand before this holy friar. I am your husband if you like of me. Another Hero! And I'll be sworn upon't that he loves her; For here's a paper written in his hand, A halting sonnet of his own pure brain, Fashion'd to Beatrice. I had well hop'd thou wouldst have denied Beatrice, that I might have cudgell'd thee out of thy single life, to make thee a double-dealer, which out of question thou wilt be if my cousin do not look exceeding narrowly to thee.
